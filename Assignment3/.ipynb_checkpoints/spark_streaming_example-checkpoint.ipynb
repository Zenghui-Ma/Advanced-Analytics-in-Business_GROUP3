On the public Internet, such a packet either has\\na spoofed source address, and it cannot actually originate as claimed, or the\\npacket cannot be delivered.^[1] The requirement to filter these packets (i.e.\\nnot forward them) is found in RFC 1812, Section 5.3.7 (Martian Address\\nFiltering).\\n\\nMartian packets commonly arise from IP address spoofing in denial-of-service\\nattacks,^[2] but can also arise from network equipment malfunction or\\nmisconfiguration of a host.^[1]\\n\\nIn Linux terminology, a Martian packet is an IP packet received by the kernel\\non a specific interface, while routing tables indicate that the source IP is\\nexpected on another interface.^[3]^[4]\\n\\nThe name is derived from packet from Mars, meaning that packet seems to be not\\nof this Earth.^[5]\\n\\n## IPv4 and IPv6[edit]\\n\\nIn both IPv4 and IPv6, a Martian packet has a source address, a destination\\naddress, or both within one of the special-use ranges.^[6]\\n\\n## Transition mechanisms[edit]\\n\\n### 6to4[edit]\\n\\n6to4 is an IPv6 transition technology where the IPv6 address encodes the\\noriginating IPv4 address such that every IPv4 /32 has a corresponding, unique\\nIPv6 /48 prefix. Because 6to4 relays use the encoded value for determining the\\nend site of the 6to4 tunnel, 6to4 addresses corresponding to IPv4 Martians are\\nnot routable and should never appear on the public Internet.\\n\\n### Teredo tunneling[edit]\\n\\nTeredo is another IPv6 transition technology that encodes the originating IPv4\\naddress in the IPv6 address. However, the encoding format encodes the Teredo\\nserver address and tunnel information before the IPv4 client address. Thus\\nthere is no definable set of prefixes more specific than 2001:0::/32 for\\nTeredo packets with Martian end-site addresses. It is, however, possible to\\nspoof Teredo packets with the Teredo server IPv4 address set to a Martian.\\n\\n## See also[edit]\\n\\n  * Bogon filtering\\n  * Christmas tree packet\\n  * Broadcast storm\\n\\n## References[edit]\\n\\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Baker, F.

I will again give you some\\nexcerpts, full pdf as usual down below.\\n\\n> Hi, I was actually on the fence of how to respond to this! Other members of\\n> the code of conduct team wanted to make sure that you understood that we\\n> were being quite serious and were open to discussion\\n\\nby giving a 6-sentence reply you are not communicating that.\\n\\n> However, it was brought to our attention apparently you have decided to take\\n> to posting about this to your blog.\\n\\nI have full rights to do so, just like you apparently had the right to post it\\nto your mailing list.\\n\\n> You even dug through my mastodon to find an old post I made?\\n\\n\\\"Old\\\" is quite the statement - the post I reference is Feb 25th, 3 weeks\\nbefore your original e-mail. What is old, is your intel, being 1.5 if not over\\n2 years old.\\n\\nNo \\\"digging\\\" was necessary - it's a public account. Just like you \\\"dug\\nthrough\\\" my blog and discord server.\\n\\n> Anyway, this is beyond unacceptable. I will be disabling your account on\\n> Freedesktop after wrting this email. You will be removed from any other FDO\\n> spaces as well\\n\\nWhat is unacceptable is your power trip.\\n\\n> only one person in this situation has posted libel regarding the other in a\\n> public space, specifically you on your blog, and if I am harassed as a\\n> result of that libel I will be contacting you with a real lawyer.\\n\\nFeel free. If posting your own methods of harassment to see by the public is\\nlibel, sure. Last time I checked, libel has to actually be unjustly\\nunfavorable. I post your own words.\\n\\n### Final (probably) conclusion\\n\\nAs we can see, X.org/Freedesktop/RedHat utilizes people who are power-hungry,\\nhypocritical and self-obsessed as moderators to say the least. Moderators that\\ndo not wish to look at themselves in a mirror, and treat any and all\\ndisagreement as a personal attack.\\n\\nOn one hand, they dig through others' 2-year-old messages on a discord server,\\nbut on the other are shocked when someone posts a screenshot of their 3-weeks-\\nold post on mastodon.\\n\\nThey do not accept any discussion, Lyude themselves suggesting that they were\\nNOT willing to indulge in any, despite the content of this email:\\n\\nDear Lyude, before calling this old, please look at the date posted.\\n\\nBest part is, this post was made shortly before Lyude's 3-weeks-later reply.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nAs of now, I have been banned from the Freedesktop Gitlab instance and related\\nIRC channels.\\n\\nFor Hyprland Development, Hyprland and Hypr*, this doesn't mean much. We are\\nstill allowed to use any and all software under the Freedesktop umbrella as\\nper their FOSS licenses. What is a shame is that I cannot contribute any\\npatches/issues to wlroots, which, well, at least in my opinion, were positive\\nadditions. But that's just my opinion, it seems.\\n\\nFor freedesktop, this means that it's no longer truly appropriate to call it\\nfree, as it absolutely is not. The banhammer is wielded by people who\\nseemingly only wield it to silence people whom they disagree with.\\n\\n## Closer\\n\\nIt's a shame to see such an important pillar of the modern Linux desktop,\\nFreedesktop, in such a state.\\n\\nI truly hope it can improve with time, regardless of whether I am a part of it\\nor not. I really do hope so. Not because of me, but because of all the past\\nand possibly future instances of similar behavior.\\n\\nIf anyone here is marring the reputation of Freedesktop, unfortunately, in my\\nopinion, it's you, Lyude.\\n\\nThank you, dear reader, from the bottom of my heart, for reading this thread,\\nregardless of whether you agree with me or not.

While water and\\nfood are necessities for all creatures, humans relied on stone tools to hunt\\nand butcher animals, as they lack the sharp claws or fangs of other\\npredators,\\u201d Barkai explains.\\n\\nBarkai is the senior author of a paper published in the Springer journal\\nAchaeologies.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n  * Society\\n\\n### 50 remarkable and inspirational women in Australian science\\n\\n\\u201cA study of indigenous groups that lived until recently, with some still alive\\ntoday, shows that hunter-gatherers attribute great importance to the source of\\nthe stone \\u2013 the quarry itself \\u2013 imbuing it with potency and sanctity, and\\nhence also spiritual worship,\\u201d Barkai says.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople have been making pilgrimages to such sites for generations upon\\ngenerations, leaving offerings at the rock outcrop, while adjacent outcrops,\\nequally suitable for stone tool production, remain untouched. We sought to\\nunderstand why; what is special about these sites?\\u201d\\n\\nAncient humans have been making stone tools for millions of years. Barkai and\\nhis colleagues conducted a study of tool-making sites dating to the\\nPalaeolithic (Old Stone Age, 3.3 million\\u201312,000 years ago).\\n\\nThe sites are in the Upper Galilee region in northern Israel and southern\\nLebanon. They have large flint reserves for crafting and are within walking\\ndistance of major Palaeolithic sites of the Hula Valley \\u2013 Gesher Benot Ya\\u2019akov\\n(790,000 years old) and Ma\\u2019ayan Baruch (500,000 years old).\\n\\nThere are thousands of quarries in the area where, until about 500,000 years\\nago, Homo erectus made tools and left offerings. But flint was present in\\nother locations untouched by these ancient people.\\n\\nBarkai\\u2019s decided to cross-reference the migration routes of elephants \\u2013 a\\nstaple in the diet of prehistoric humans \\u2013 with the location of flint quarries\\nand found a correlation.\\n\\nIllustration of elephant hunting using spears. Credit: Dana Ackerfeld.\\n\\n\\u201cAn elephant consumes 400 liters of water a day on average, and that\\u2019s why it\\nhas fixed movement paths,\\u201d says lead author Dr Meir Finkel, also at Tel Aviv\\nUniversity. \\u201cWe find quarrying and knapping sites in the Upper Galilee located\\na short distance from elephant butchering sites, which are positioned along\\nthe elephants\\u2019 paths.\\u201d\\n\\nThe researchers applied this model and found similar tendencies in the\\nPalaeolithic in Asia, Europe and Africa involving elephants and mammoths as\\nwell as other large prey like hippos and camels.\\n\\n\\u201cIt appears that the Palaeolithic holy trinity holds true universally:\\nWherever there was water, there were elephants, and wherever there were\\nelephants, humans had to find suitable rock outcrops to quarry stone and make\\ntools in order to hunt and butcher their favourite mega herbivores,\\u201d says\\nBarkai. \\u201cIt was a tradition: For hundreds of thousands of years the elephants\\nwandered along the same route, while humans produced stone tools nearby.\\nUltimately, those elephants became extinct, and the world changed forever.\\u201d\\n\\nOriginally published by Cosmos as Human ancestors visited the same quarries\\nfor hundreds of thousands of years\\n\\n#### You Might Like\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Fossils in China show \\u201cPeking Man\\u201d lived alongside ravens\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Did meat-eating really play a big role in human evolution?\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Oldest human presence in Europe found in Ukraine\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Ancient human species settled African highlands 2 million years ago\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Fossils in China show \\u201cPeking Man\\u201d lived alongside ravens\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Did meat-eating really play a big role in human evolution?\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Oldest human presence in Europe found in Ukraine\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Ancient human species settled African highlands 2 million years ago\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Fossils in China show \\u201cPeking Man\\u201d lived alongside ravens\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n\\n## Did meat-eating really play a big role in human evolution?\\n\\nLoading next article...\\n\\n  * Shop\\n  * About Us\\n  * FAQ\\n  * Terms of use\\n  * Schools\\n  * Donate\\n  * Contact us\\n  * Privacy Policy\\n\\n'Cosmos' and 'The Science of Everything' are registered trademarks in\\nAustralia and the USA, and owned by The Royal Institution of Australia Inc.\\n\\nT: 08 7120 8600 (Australia) +61 8 7120 8600 (International) Customer Service\\n9:00 am \\u2014 5:00 pm ACST Monday to Friday\\n\\ninfo@cosmosmagazine.com\\n\\nPO Box 3652, Rundle Mall SA 5000, Australia\\n\\n55 Exchange Place, Adelaide SA 5000, Australia\\n\\nGet an update of science stories with push notifications.

Lee\\n\\n  * Add a comment\\n  * Share\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pocket Reddit Email\\n\\nWe have long deemed ourselves to be at the pinnacle of cognitive abilities\\namong animals. But that is different from being at the pinnacle of evolution\\nin a number of very important ways. As Mark Twain pointed out in 1903, to\\npresume that evolution has been a long path leading to humans as its crowning\\nachievement is just as preposterous as presuming that the whole purpose of\\nbuilding the Eiffel Tower was to put that final coat of paint on its tip.\\nMoreover, evolution is not synonymous with progress, but simply change over\\ntime. And humans aren\\u2019t even the youngest, most recently evolved species. For\\nexample, more than 500 new species of cichlid fish in Lake Victoria, the\\nyoungest of the great African lakes, have appeared since it filled with water\\nsome 14,500 years ago.\\n\\nStill, there is something unique about our brain that makes it cognitively\\nable to ponder even its own constitution and the reasons for its own\\npresumption that it reigns over all other brains. If we are the ones putting\\nother animals under the microscope, and not the other way around,^1 then the\\nhuman brain must have something that no other brain has.\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

James Balog / Getty Images\\n\\nSheer mass would be the obvious candidate: If the brain is what generates\\nconscious cognition, having more brain should only mean more cognitive\\nabilities. But here the elephant in the room is, well, the elephant\\u2014a species\\nthat is larger-brained than humans, but not equipped with behaviors as complex\\nand flexible as ours. Besides, equating larger brain size with greater\\ncognitive capabilities presupposes that all brains are made the same way,\\nstarting with a similar relationship between brain size and number of neurons.\\nBut my colleagues and I already knew that all brains were not made the same.\\nPrimates have a clear advantage over other mammals, which lies in an\\nevolutionary turn of events that resulted in the economical way in which\\nneurons are added to their brain, without the massive increases in average\\ncell size seen in other mammals.\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Sheer number of neurons would be the\\nobvious candidate, regardless of brain size, because if neurons are what\\ngenerates conscious cognition, then having more neurons should mean more\\ncognitive capabilities. Indeed, even though cognitive differences among\\nspecies were once thought to be qualitative, with a number of cognitive\\ncapabilities once believed to be exclusive to humans, it is now recognized\\nthat the cognitive differences between humans and other animals are a matter\\nof degree. That is, they are quantitative, not qualitative, differences.\\n\\n> Did the African elephant brain, more than three times as heavy as ours,\\n> really have more neurons than our brain?\\n\\nOur tool use is impressively complex, and we even design tools to make other\\ntools\\u2014but chimpanzees use twigs as tools to dig for termites, monkeys learn to\\nuse rakes to reach for food that is out of sight, and crows not only shape\\nwires to use as tools to get food, but also keep them safe for later reuse.\\nAlex, the African gray parrot owned by psychologist Irene Pepperberg, learned\\nto produce words that symbolize objects, and chimpanzees and gorillas, though\\nthey cannot vocalize for anatomical reasons, learn to communicate with sign\\nlanguage. Chimpanzees can learn hierarchical sequences: They play games where\\nthey must touch squares in the ascending order of the numbers previously\\nshown, and they do it as well and as fast as highly trained humans.\\nChimpanzees and elephants cooperate to secure food that is distant and can\\u2019t\\nbe reached by their efforts alone. Chimpanzees, but also other primates,\\nappear to infer others\\u2019 mental state, a requirement for showing deceitful\\nbehavior. Even birds seem to have knowledge of other individuals\\u2019 mental\\nstate, as magpies will overtly cache food in the presence of onlookers and\\nthen retrieve and move it to a secret location as soon as the onlookers are\\ngone. Chimpanzees and gorillas, elephants, dolphins, and also magpies appear\\nto recognize themselves in the mirror, using it to inspect a visible mark\\nplaced on their heads.\\n\\nThese are fundamental discoveries that attest to the cognitive capacities of\\nnonhuman species\\u2014but such one-of-a-kind observations do not serve the types of\\ncross-species comparisons we need to make if we are to find out what it is\\nabout the brain that allows some species to achieve cognitive feats that are\\noutside the reach of others. And here we run into another problem, the biggest\\none at this point: how to measure cognitive capabilities in a large number of\\nspecies and in a way that generates measurements that are comparable across\\nall those species.\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

They found that the best correlate\\nwith correct performance in the test of self-control was absolute brain\\nvolume\\u2014except for the Asian elephant, which, despite being the largest-brained\\nin the set, failed miserably at the task. A number of reasons come to mind,\\nfrom \\u201cIt did not care about the food or the task\\u201d to \\u201cIt enjoyed annoying its\\ncaretakers by not performing.\\u201d (I like to think that the reason why it\\u2019s so\\nhard to train monkeys to do things that are easily learned by humans is their\\ndismay at the obviousness of the task: \\u201cC\\u2019mon, you want me to move to do just\\nthat?

Here, she gives a TED Talk.James Duncan Davidson,\\ncourtesy of TED\\n\\nThe most interesting possibility to me, however, is that the African elephant\\nmight not have all the prefrontal neurons in the cerebral cortex that it takes\\nto solve self-control decision tasks like the ones in the study. Once we had\\nrecognized that primate and rodent brains are made differently, with different\\nnumbers of neurons for their size, we had predicted that the African elephant\\nbrain might have as few as 3 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 21\\nbillion neurons in the cerebellum, compared to our 16 billion and 69 billion,\\ndespite its much larger size\\u2014if it was built like a rodent brain.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if it was built like a primate brain, then the African\\nelephant brain might have a whopping 62 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex\\nand 159 billion neurons in the cerebellum. But elephants are neither rodents\\nnor primates, of course; they belong to the superorder Afrotheria, as do a\\nnumber of small animals like the elephant shrew and the golden mole we had\\nalready studied\\u2014and determined that their brains did, in fact, scale very much\\nlike rodent brains.\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\\n\\nHere was a very important test, then: Did the African elephant brain, more\\nthan three times as heavy as ours, really have more neurons than our brain? If\\nit did, then my hypothesis that cognitive powers come with sheer absolute\\nnumbers of neurons would be disproved. But if the human brain still had many\\nmore neurons than the much larger African elephant brain, then that would\\nsupport my hypothesis that the simplest explanation for the remarkable\\ncognitive abilities of the human species is the remarkable number of its brain\\nneurons, equaled by none other, regardless of the size of the brain. In\\nparticular, I expected the number of neurons to be larger in the human than in\\nthe African elephant cerebral cortex.\\n\\nThe logic behind my expectation was the cognitive literature that had long\\nhailed the cerebral cortex (or, more precisely, the prefrontal part of the\\ncerebral cortex) as the sole seat of higher cognition\\u2014abstract reasoning,\\ncomplex decision making, and planning for the future. However, nearly all of\\nthe cerebral cortex is connected to the cerebellum through loops that tie\\ncortical and cerebellar information processing to each other, and more and\\nmore studies have been implicating the cerebellum in the cognitive functions\\nof the cerebral cortex, with the two structures working in tandem. And,\\nbecause these two structures together accounted for the vast majority of all\\nneurons in the brain, cognitive capabilities should correlate equally well\\nwith the number of neurons in the whole brain, in the cerebral cortex, and in\\nthe cerebellum.\\n\\nWhich is why our findings for the African elephant brain turned out to be\\nbetter than expected.\\n\\nBrain Soup by the Gallon\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\\n\\nThe brain hemisphere of an African elephant weighs more than 2.5 kilograms,\\nwhich meant that it would obviously have to be cut into hundreds of smaller\\npieces for processing and counting since turning brains into soup to determine\\nthe number of neurons inside works with chunks of no more than 3 to 5 grams of\\ntissue at a time. I wanted the cutting to be systematic, instead of haphazard.\\nWe had previously used a deli slicer to turn a human brain hemisphere into one\\nsuch full series of thin cuts. The slicer was wonderful for separating\\ncortical gyri\\u2014but it had one major drawback: Too much of the human brain\\nmatter stayed on its circular blade, precluding estimates of the total number\\nof cells in the hemisphere. If we wanted to know the total number of neurons\\nin the elephant brain hemisphere, we had to cut it by hand, and in thicker\\nslices, to minimize eventual losses to the point of making them negligible.\\n\\n> Why spend $100,000 when a handheld butcher knife would do the job well\\n> enough?\\n\\nAnd so the day started at the hardware store, where my daughter and I (school\\nvacation having just started) went looking for L-brackets to serve as solid,\\nflat, regular frames for cutting the elephant hemisphere, plus the longest\\nknife I could hold in one hand. (Here was an opportunity not to be missed for\\na young teenager, who years later could say, \\u201cHey, Mom, remember the day we\\nsliced up an elephant brain?\\u201d) We first sawed off the structural\\nreinforcements of the L-brackets then made the elephant brain fit inside.\\nSure, there are fancy $100,000 machines that would do the job to perfection,\\nbut why spend that much money when a handheld butcher knife would do the job\\nwell enough?\\n\\nI laid the hemisphere flat on the bench top, framed inside the two L-brackets.\\nA student held the frames in position while I held the hemisphere down with my\\nleft hand and sliced firmly but gently through the brain with the right, in\\nback-and-forth movements. Several cuts later, also into the back half as well\\nas the cerebellum, and we had a completely sliced elephant brain \\u201cloaf\\u201d lying\\nflat on our benchtop: 16 sections through the cortical hemisphere, eight\\nthrough the cerebellum, plus the entire brainstem and the gigantic, 20-gram\\nolfactory bulb (10 times the mass of a rat brain) lying separately.\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In\\nall, we had 381 pieces of tissue, most of which were still several times\\nlarger than the 5 grams we could process at one time. It was by far the most\\ntissue we had processed. One person working alone and processing one piece of\\ntissue per day would need well over one year\\u2014nonstop\\u2014to finish the job. This\\nclearly had to be a team effort, especially if I wanted to have the results in\\nno more than six months. But, even with a small army of undergraduates, it was\\ntaking too long: two months went by and only one-tenth of the brain hemisphere\\nhad been processed. Something had to be done.\\n\\nCapitalism came to the rescue. I did some math and realized I had some $2,500\\nto spare\\u2014roughly $1 per gram of tissue to be processed. I gathered the team\\nand made them an offer: Anybody could help, and everyone would be rewarded\\nfinancially by the same amount. Small partnerships quickly formed, with one\\nstudent doing the grinding, the other doing the counting, and both sharing the\\nproceeds. It worked wonders. My husband would visit the lab and comment, in\\nawe, on the crowd of students at the bench, chatting animatedly while working\\naway (until then, they mostly worked in shifts, it being a small lab). Jairo\\nPorf\\u00edrio took over the large batches of antibody stains, I did all the neuron\\ncounts at the microscope\\u2014and in just under six months we had the entire\\nAfrican elephant brain hemisphere processed, as planned.\\n\\nAnd the Winner Is ...\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\\n\\nLo and behold, the African elephant brain had more neurons than the human\\nbrain. And not just a few more: a full three times the number of neurons, 257\\nbillion to our 86 billion neurons. But\\u2014and this was a huge, immense \\u201cbut\\u201d\\u2014a\\nwhopping 98 percent of those neurons were located in the cerebellum, at the\\nback of the brain. In every other mammal we had examined so far, the\\ncerebellum concentrated most of the brain neurons, but never much more than 80\\npercent of them. The exceptional distribution of neurons within the elephant\\nbrain left a relatively meager 5.6 billion neurons in the whole cerebral\\ncortex itself. Despite the size of the African elephant cerebral cortex, the\\n5.6 billion neurons in it paled in comparison to the average 16 billion\\nneurons concentrated in the much smaller human cerebral cortex.\\n\\nSo here was our answer. No, the human brain does not have more neurons than\\nthe much larger elephant brain\\u2014but the human cerebral cortex has nearly three\\ntimes as many neurons as the over twice as large cerebral cortex of the\\nelephant. Unless we were ready to concede that the elephant, with three times\\nmore neurons in its cerebellum (and, therefore, in its brain), must be more\\ncognitively capable than we humans, we could rule out the hypothesis that\\ntotal number of neurons in the cerebellum was in any way limiting or\\nsufficient to determine the cognitive capabilities of a brain.\\n\\nOnly the cerebral cortex remained, then. Nature had done the experiment that\\nwe needed, dissociating numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex from the\\nnumber of neurons in the cerebellum. The superior cognitive capabilities of\\nthe human brain over the elephant brain can simply\\u2014and only\\u2014be attributed to\\nthe remarkably large number of neurons in its cerebral cortex.\\n\\nWhile we don\\u2019t have the measurements of cognitive capabilities required to\\ncompare all mammalian species, or at least those for which we have numbers of\\ncortical neurons, we can already make a testable prediction based on those\\nnumbers. If the absolute number of neurons in the cerebral cortex is the main\\nlimitation to the cognitive capabilities of a species, then my predicted\\nranking of species by cognitive abilities based on number of neurons in the\\ncerebral cortex would look like this:\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\\n\\nwhich is more intuitively reasonable than the current ranking based on brain\\nmass, which places animals such as the giraffe above many primate species,\\nlike this:\\n\\nAs it turns out, there is a simple explanation for how the human brain, and it\\nalone, can be at the same time similar to others in its evolutionary\\nconstraints, and yet so different to the point of endowing us with the ability\\nto ponder our own material and metaphysical origins. First, we are primates,\\nand this bestows upon humans the advantage of a large number of neurons packed\\ninto a small cerebral cortex. And second, thanks to a technological innovation\\nintroduced by our ancestors, we escaped the energetic constraint that limits\\nall other animals to the smaller number of cortical neurons that can be\\nafforded by a raw diet in the wild.\\n\\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

And what do we do that absolutely no other animal does, and which I\\nbelieve allowed us to amass that remarkable number of neurons in the first\\nplace? We cook our food. The rest\\u2014all the technological innovations made\\npossible by that outstanding number of neurons in our cerebral cortex, and the\\nensuing cultural transmission of those innovations that has kept the spiral\\nthat turns capacities into abilities moving upward\\u2014is history.\\n\\nSuzana Herculano-Houzel is a Brazilian neuroscientist.

Credit: Mashable screenshot\\n\\nThis would certainly be a worrying world news development. Earlier that week,\\nIsrael had conducted an airstrike on Iran's embassy in Syria, killing two\\ngenerals as well as other officers. Retaliation from Iran seemed like a\\nplausible occurrence.\\n\\nSEE ALSO: I\\u2019ve been forcibly blue-checked on Elon Musk's X. Here\\u2019s what it\\u2019s\\nlike.\\n\\nBut, there was one major problem: Iran did not attack Israel. The headline was\\nfake.\\n\\nEven more concerning, the fake headline was apparently generated by X's own\\nofficial AI chatbot, Grok, and then promoted by X's trending news product,\\nExplore, on the very first day of an updated version of the feature.\\n\\n> Tweet may have been deleted\\n\\n## How Musk let this happen\\n\\nA few years before Elon Musk acquired the platform then-known as Twitter, the\\ncompany rolled out a new feature that provided written context for trending\\ntopics. The technology powering the written trend descriptions? Humans.\\n\\nPreviously when a story would break, Twitter's algorithms would catch the\\nrelevant keywords being posted and share the trend, but it sometimes wouldn't\\nbe obvious why a given set of words was trending.\\n\\nBut, in 2020, Twitter put together a team of human editors to curate news and\\nput trends in context. In addition, the top tweets that showed up under a\\ntrending topic would no longer just be algorithmically ranked, but include\\nhuman curation as well. One year later, Twitter partnered with AP and Reuters\\nto further bolster its efforts to provide human-provided context to trending\\ntopics.\\n\\nShortly after Musk bought the company in October 2022, though, the written\\ncontext on trending topics disappeared. Musk had laid off Twitter's human\\neditors. As Reuters reported in November 2022, \\\"Twitter's curation team, which\\nwas responsible for 'highlighting and contextualizing the best events and\\nstories that unfold on Twitter,' had been axed.\\\"\\n\\n## X's newly updated Explore page\\n\\nEarlier this week, some X fan accounts like @XDaily shared screenshots of X's\\nupcoming Explore page relaunch. X's Explore page includes the platform's\\ninfamous trending topics list along with specific section breakouts like\\n\\\"News\\\" and \\\"Sports\\\" to provide users with trending stories in each particular\\nsubject category.\\n\\n> Tweet may have been deleted\\n\\nMusk's updated Explore page looked poised to bring back the written context\\nprovided to trending topics and stories.\\n\\nOn April 4, X began rolling out its newly updated Explore page. The update\\nprovides top user posts on each individual trending topic as well as an easy-\\nto-digest summary of the subject matter above the user content. At the very\\ntop of the page, an X-created headline presents the information to readers\\nmuch as if they were about to read an article on the topic.\\n\\nIn addition, the update also gives Explore a new, prominent location on the\\nplatform. Explore's trending stories now appear embedded directly in the\\nright-hand sidebar of the main X homepage, where the trending topics list used\\nto be located, which hundreds of millions of X's daily users view everyday.\\n\\nIn a screenshot captured from popular Twitch user Hasan Piker's stream, the\\nfake AI-generated X headline can be seen trending on the platform's homepage\\nsidebar. Credit: Hasan Piker's Twitch\\n\\nHowever, Musk has not brought back Twitter's curation team, nor has he hired\\nnew human editors to write the context X now provides.\\n\\nThe context is written by X's AI chatbot, Grok.\\n\\n## The danger of X depending on AI\\n\\nWe know that Grok, an AI feature heavily promoted by Musk, powers X's\\ncontextualized summaries because X says so itself in the fine print on every\\nExplore page.\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\n  * Elon Musk's X funds lawsuit against Jack Dorsey's Block\\n  * Elon Musk's X tests 'adult content' label for X-rated Communities\\n  * Elon Musk confirms X accounts with certain subscriber levels will get Premium bonuses\\n\\n> Tweet may have been deleted\\n\\n\\\"Grok is an early feature and can make mistakes,\\\" reads the tiny note from X\\nunderneath the written context provided on the Explore page. \\\"Verify its\\noutputs.\\\"\\n\\nMashable observed X's \\\"Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles\\\" page which\\nspread fake news as it was trending on Thursday.\\n\\nBased on our observations, it appears that the topic started trending because\\nof a sudden uptick of blue checkmark accounts (users who pay a monthly\\nsubscription to X for Premium features including the verification badge)\\nspamming the same copy-and-paste misinformation about Iran attacking Israel.\\nThe curated posts provided by X were full of these verified accounts spreading\\nthis fake news alongside an unverified video depicting explosions.\\n\\nA side-by-side comparison of two separate posts on the X Explore page showing\\nfake news posts from blue check users that informed Grok. Credit: Mashable\\nscreenshot\\n\\nFrom there, it appears X's algorithms noticed a potential story trend within\\nthese users' posts, and an Explore story page was created. We can deduce from\\nX's own claims about its inner workings that Grok must have then created an\\nofficial-looking written narrative, along with a catchy headline. It did all\\nthis based on select users sharing fake news, in an automated attempt to\\nprovide context for what the platform itself seemed to assume was a real\\nstory.\\n\\nThis wouldn't be the first time Grok provided users with misinformation.\\nPrevious reporting on the early versions of X's chatbot found that it often\\ncreated fake news in private chats with the select few users who had access to\\nit. However, this recent incident combined with the new Explore feature\\npresents the first time X took Grok's misinformation, packaged it as a real\\ntrending news story, and promoted it to its entire user base, ostensibly as\\ncontext for a real event.\\n\\nUnder Musk, disinformation has skyrocketed on the platform known as X. Thanks\\nto the new Explore product, the company promoted a falsehood, disseminated by\\npaying bad actors who stand to make money in exchange for generating\\nengagements.\\n\\nOne day after Grok generated this fake story that X then promoted via its\\nExplore page, the company rolled Grok out to all Premium-subscribed X users so\\nthey could use the misinformation-creating AI chatbot as well.\\n\\n> Tweet may have been deleted\\n\\nTopics Artificial Intelligence Twitter Elon Musk\\n\\nRecommended For You\\n\\nXiaomi 14 Ultra review: Does its pro-level camera beat the iPhone?\\n\\nHey sir, can your camera also make phone calls?\\n\\n04/05/2024\\n\\nBy Stan Schroeder\\n\\nElon Musk's X suspends users who post alleged name of alt-right comic creator\\n\\n'StoneToss' webcomics frequently feature antisemitism, racism, and anti-LGBTQ\\nsentiment.\\n\\n03/20/2024\\n\\nBy Matt Binder\\n\\nElon Musk kills Don Lemon's unaired X show after interview with the former CNN\\nhost\\n\\nMusk has canceled Lemon.\\n\\n03/13/2024\\n\\nBy Matt Binder\\n\\nBest hookup apps and dating sites to find casual sex\\n\\nFind a casual fling or a spontaneous one-night stand.\\n\\n04/03/2024\\n\\nBy Leah Stodart and Tabitha Britt\\n\\n'Godzilla X Kong' in love?

April 2024 von Christoph Bergmann // 7 Kommentare\\n\\nSkulptur eines Zentaurus aus schwarzem Marmor. Bild von Carole Raddato via\\nflickr.com. Lizenz: Creative Commons\\n\\nIm M\\u00e4rz wurde Monero (XMR) das Opfer einer Spamwelle. Dahinter stand ein\\nspezifischer Angriff, der versuchte, die Anonymit\\u00e4t von Ringsignaturen zu\\nbrechen. Wir erkl\\u00e4ren, was geschah.\\n\\nIm Lauf des M\\u00e4rzes gab es einen Spam-Angriff auf den Privacycoin-Monero, der\\noffenbar versuchte, die Transaktionen etwas weniger anonym zu machen.\\n\\nIn gewisser Weise stellte die Spam-Welle den bisher ausgefeiltesten Versuch\\ndar, die Kryptow\\u00e4hrung mit der ausgefeiltesten Anonymit\\u00e4t zu brechen. Wir sind\\nalso im technologischen Krieg um Privatsph\\u00e4re auf dem h\\u00f6chsten Gipfel\\nangelangt, wo sich auch die Widersacher, Angreifer und Verteidiger, mit\\nHochachtung begegnen.\\n\\nAnzahl t\\u00e4glicher Monero-Transaktionen seit Ende Dezember 2023 nach\\nBitInfoCharts.com\\n\\nF\\u00fcr uns als Laien wird es nicht ganz einfach, nachzuvollziehen, was geschah \\u2013\\naber ein Fest ist es dennoch. Auf der Oberfl\\u00e4che geschah das folgende: Anfang\\nM\\u00e4rz sprang die Anzahl von Standard-Transaktionen von etwa 15.000 am Tag auf\\nmehr als 100.000, und blieb fast den ganzen Monat \\u00fcber auf diesem Niveau. Die\\nGr\\u00f6\\u00dfe der Bl\\u00f6cke, die alle zwei Minuten gefunden werden, erreichte einen\\nSchwellenwert von 300 Kilobyte, woraufhin ein Mechanismus der dynamischen\\nAnpassung griff, der die Gr\\u00f6\\u00dfe der Bl\\u00f6cke sachte erh\\u00f6hte.\\n\\nIn der Monero-Community vermutet man, dass es sich um einen \\u201eBlack\\nMarble\\u201c-Angriff handelte, wie ihn der Entwickler Rucknium beschreibt. Um ihn\\nim Ansatz zu verstehen, muss man wissen, dass Monero sogenannte Ringsignaturen\\nverwendet.\\n\\n## Der Unterschied zwischen Transaktionen bei Bitcoin und Monero\\n\\nWir m\\u00fcssen hier ein kleines St\\u00fcckchen aushoilen: Eine Bitcoin-Transaktion\\nnimmt einen Input \\u2013 einen sogenanntes UTXO (unspent transaction output) \\u2013 und\\nsendet ihn als Output an einem Empf\\u00e4nger. Durch eine Signatur beweist der\\nSender, Besitzer des Inputs zu sein; die Kette der signierten Inputs verbindet\\ndie Adressen, wodurch man der Spur des Geldes gut folgen kann.\\n\\nBei Monero wird diese Kette durchbruchen. Ein Sender verwendet nicht einen\\neinzelnen Input, sondern einen \\u201eRing\\u201c an g\\u00fcltigen Inputs. Unter diesen ist\\nsein eigener, aber auch weitere, die er zuf\\u00e4llig auf der Blockchain ausw\\u00e4hlt.\\nMit seiner Signatur beweist der Sender lediglich, dass er den Schl\\u00fcssel f\\u00fcr\\neinen dieser Inputs hat, aber nicht, f\\u00fcr welchen. Die Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe gibt an, wie\\nviele Inputs er verwendet. Sie ist derzeit standardm\\u00e4\\u00dfig 16.\\n\\nEine Monero-Transaktion: auf der Seite der Inputs findet man 16 Mitglieder der\\nRinggruppe. Nur einer davon versendet tats\\u00e4chlich Geld.\\n\\nDie Ringsignaturen machen es mehr oder weniger unm\\u00f6glich, in einer Transaktion\\nSender und Empf\\u00e4nger zu identifizieren. Sie sind allerdings nur ein Teil des\\nPrivacy-Sets von Monero: Stealth Adressen sorgen daf\\u00fcr, dass die Adresse des\\nEmpf\\u00e4ngers unbekannt bleibt, Zero Knowledge Proofs verbergen den versendeten\\nBetrag.\\n\\nIn diesem Set sind Ringsignaturen das schw\\u00e4chste Glied. Das liegt auch mit am\\nBlack Marble Angriff, den man im M\\u00e4rz beobachten konnte.\\n\\n## Schwarzer Marmor\\n\\nWenn man versteht, wie Ringsignaturen funktionieren, ist der Black Marble\\nAngriff leicht zu begreifen: Man spamt die Blockchain mit Transaktionen, um\\nm\\u00f6glichst viele Outputs zu besitzen. Diese kann man dann in den Ringen anderer\\nTransaktionen ausschlie\\u00dfen, was deren effektive Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe reduziert.\\n\\nEin Vorteil des Angriffs ist, dass der Algorithmus, mit dem einen Wallet den\\nRing bildet, neuere Outputs bevorzugt.\\n\\nDer Name des Angriffs kommt daher, dass das Ausschlussverfahren daran\\nerinnert, einen schwarzen Marmor durch hypergeometrische Verteilungen zu\\nzeichnen. Die konkrete Formel ist zu viel Mathematik f\\u00fcr diese Stelle, aber\\nsie gibt an, wie hoch die Chance eines Angreifers ist, andere Ringe soweit zu\\nverkleinern, dass man den Transaktionsstrom einigerma\\u00dfen nachvollziehen kann.\\n\\nSo kann man kalkulieren, wie hoch die effektive Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe w\\u00e4hrend des Spam-\\nAngriffs war. Wie der Monero-Forscher Rucknium zeigt, sank sie relativ rasch\\nvon 16 auf f\\u00fcnf bis sechs, w\\u00e4hrend der Angreifer 75 Prozent aller frischen\\nOutputs besa\\u00df.\\n\\nEffektiv konnte der Angreifer also mit einer Wahrscheinlichkeit von etwa eins\\nzu f\\u00fcnf erraten, welches der wahre Input einer Transaktion war. Monero hat,\\nmit anderen Worten, weitgehend gehalten.\\n\\n## K\\u00fcnftige Szenarien\\n\\nAn sich k\\u00f6nnte man sich jetzt zur\\u00fccklehnen und ausatmen. Rucknium simuliert\\naber noch die langfristigen Szenarien. Was passiert etwa, wenn der Angreifer\\nnicht nur 300 Kilobyte f\\u00fcllt, sondern auch 500, 1000 oder 2000? Halten die\\nRingsignaturen dann immer noch?\\n\\nDabei zeigt sich, dass bei der aktuellen Standard-Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe von 16 die\\neffektive Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe schon ab 500 Kilobyte auf 4 und ab etwa 1000 auf zwei\\nsinkt. Ab nun k\\u00f6nnte ein Angreifer bei vielen Transaktionen sicher und bei\\nnoch mehr mit brauchbarer Wahrscheinlichkeit erraten, wer sie versendet hat.\\n\\nChart der nominellen und effektiven Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe abh\\u00e4ngig von der St\\u00e4rke eines\\nBlack Marble Angriffs. Aus dem Paper von Rucknium.\\n\\nW\\u00fcrde man dagegen die Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe auf 40 oder 60 anheben, l\\u00e4ge sie auch bei 2000\\nKilobyte an Spam je Block noch im gr\\u00f6\\u00dftenteils sicheren Bereich. Dies h\\u00e4tte\\naber den Nachteil, dass die Transaktionen dadurch erheblich gr\\u00f6\\u00dfer werden\\nw\\u00fcrden.\\n\\nEines der Probleme mit dem Black Marble Angriff ist, dass er relativ g\\u00fcnstig\\nist. Laut Rucknium kostete die gesamte Spamwelle nur zwischen 61,5 und 81,3\\nMonero (XMR), je nachdem, welche Geb\\u00fchrenmodelle der Angreifer verwendete (was\\nman nicht exakt feststellen kann, da Monero anonym ist). Das sind etwa\\n6500-9000 Euro, was f\\u00fcr einen 23-t\\u00e4gigen Angriff nicht wirklich viel ist.\\n\\nAllerdings d\\u00fcrften die Kosten f\\u00fcr einen weitergehenden Angriff erheblich\\nteurer werden. Denn sobald die 300-Kilobyte-Schwelle je Block geknackt ist,\\nsteigen die Geb\\u00fchren deutlich an.\\n\\n## Probleme f\\u00fcr die Nutzer\\n\\nDie Ringsignaturen haben den Angriff also relativ gut \\u00fcberstanden. Man kann\\nsie theoretisch brechen, doch das nur tempor\\u00e4r, und dann muss man viel Geld\\ninvestieren.\\n\\nDennoch \\u00fcberlegt die Monero-Community schon jetzt, die Ringgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe auf 64 zu\\nerh\\u00f6hen. Zudem hat sie mit \\u201eFull Chain Membership Proofs\\u201c bereits ein Konzept\\nzur Hand, das die Ringsignaturen ersetzen kann, und das nun, nach dem Angriff,\\nfr\\u00fcher als gedacht zum Einsatz kommt, wom\\u00f6glich bereits in sechs bis zw\\u00f6lf\\nMonaten.\\n\\nEine unangenehmere Folge des Angriffs k\\u00f6nnte die Nutzbarkeit von Monero\\nbetreffen. Viele User sahen ihre Transaktionen im Mempool feststecken; es kam\\nfast den ganzen Monat \\u00fcber zu erheblich verz\\u00f6gerten Best\\u00e4tigungen, die\\nteilweise auf bis zu zwei Stunden eskalierten.\\n\\nNoch unangenehmer war wohl, dass die meisten Remote Nodes hoffnungslos\\n\\u00fcberlastet waren. An diese docken User mit ihrer Wallet an, die keinen Full\\nNode haben. F\\u00fcr sie war Monero zwischenzeitlich fast schon unbenutzbar.\\n\\nSowohl das Problem mit den Remote Nodes als auch den verz\\u00f6gerten Transaktionen\\nl\\u00e4sst sich durch eine bessere Software l\\u00f6sen, etwa indem man die\\nGeb\\u00fchrenkalkulation verbessert oder den Mempool effektiver abfragt.\\n\\nSchwieriger zu l\\u00f6sen ist aber ein anderes Problem: Der Angreifer hat f\\u00fcr\\neinige tausend Euro mehr als drei Gigabyte an Outputs geschaffen \\u2013 die nie\\nwieder gel\\u00f6scht werden, da es keinen Konsens dar\\u00fcber gibt, wann ein Output\\nwirklich verwendet wurde. So l\\u00e4sst sich die Monero-Blockchain mit relativ\\nmoderaten Betr\\u00e4gen soweit aufbl\\u00e4hen, dass so gut wie jede Operation auf ihr\\nmassiv beeintr\\u00e4chtigt wird.\\n\\nPrivatsph\\u00e4re ist eben hart und umk\\u00e4mpft. Sie ist kein Zustand, den man einmal\\nerreicht hat, sondern den man fortw\\u00e4hrend erhalten muss.\\n\\n### Teilen mit:\\n\\n  * Klick, um auf Facebook zu teilen (Wird in neuem Fenster ge\\u00f6ffnet)\\n  * Klick, um \\u00fcber Twitter zu teilen (Wird in neuem Fenster ge\\u00f6ffnet)\\n\\n### Gef\\u00e4llt mir:\\n\\nGef\\u00e4llt mir Wird geladen ...\\n\\n  * Anonymit\\u00e4t\\n  * Black Marble\\n  * Monero\\n  * Privacycoin\\n  * Privatsph\\u00e4re\\n  * Spam\\n  * XMR\\n\\n##### \\u00dcber Christoph Bergmann (2784 Artikel)\\n\\nDas Bitcoinblog wird von Bitcoin.de gesponsort, ist inhaltlich aber unabh\\u00e4ngig\\nund gibt die Meinung des Redakteurs Christoph Bergmann wieder ---\\n\\n#### 7 Kommentare zu Spam-Welle auf Monero: Der Angriff des schwarzen Marmors\\n\\n  1.

Schwerer wog in der Tat die\\nNichterreichbarkeit von \\u00f6ffentlichen Remote Nodes, die von einem Gro\\u00dfteil der\\nUser von Mobile Wallets genutzt wird. Diese war wahrscheinlich einer alten\\nVersion der Wallet Software (seit Oktober 2023 gefixt) geschuldet. Im Detail\\nholt sich die Wallet den Mempool alle 20 Sekunden vom Node Daemon, um 0-Conf\\nTransaktionen sehen zu k\\u00f6nnen. Alles kein Problem bei normalerweise\\nverschwindend kleinem Tx-Pool meist deutlich unter 1MB. Da dieser aber\\nzwischenzeitlich auf \\u00fcber 20MB angestiegen ist, wurden im alten Wallet alle 20\\nSekunden diese 20MB f\\u00e4llig, was eine 8Mbit/s Leitung voll ausreizt \\u2013 mit einem\\nverbundenen Wallet. Die neue Wallet Implementierung synchronisiert nur die\\nVer\\u00e4nderung seit dem letzten Abruf. Mit einer eigenen Heim- oder Remote-Node\\ngab es zu keinem Zeitpunkt ein Problem...\\n\\n> Schwieriger zu l\\u00f6sen ist aber ein anderes Problem: Der Angreifer hat f\\u00fcr\\n> einige tausend Euro mehr als drei Gigabyte an Outputs geschaffen \\u2013 die nie\\n> wieder gel\\u00f6scht werden, da es keinen Konsens dar\\u00fcber gibt, wann ein Output\\n> wirklich verwendet wurde.\\n\\nDas sehe ich als DataHoarder eher weniger als Problem an. In drei Wochen 3GB\\nSpam, wovon nur ein Bruchteil unl\\u00f6schbare Outputs sind halte ich bei HDD\\nGr\\u00f6\\u00dfen von 20TB+ und Preisen um 15\\u20ac/TB HDD, 50\\u20ac/TB SSD f\\u00fcr vertretbar, wenn\\nman bedenkt, dass ein UHD Stream von Netflix & Co. selbige Bandbreite\\ninnerhalb von 10 Minuten verballert.\\n\\n> Privatsph\\u00e4re ist eben hart und umk\\u00e4mpft. Sie ist kein Zustand, den man\\n> einmal erreicht hat, sondern den man fortw\\u00e4hrend erhalten muss.\\n\\nBestes Fazit ever. Ich bin nun seit ca. 9 Jahren mehr oder weniger aktiv bei\\nMonero und wenn ich etwas grundlegendes gelernt habe, dann eben dies.\\nPrivatsph\\u00e4re ist nicht bin\\u00e4r, sie ist ein Prozess, der fortw\\u00e4hrende\\nVerbesserungen ben\\u00f6tigt.\\n\\nSo kann ich einige Dinge aufz\\u00e4hlen, die nach und nach verbessert wurden: \\u2013 In\\nden Anf\\u00e4ngen Moneros waren \\u201eRinge\\u201c mit einem Input zul\\u00e4ssig, also nur dem\\ntats\\u00e4chlichen Spend, es folgten minimale Ring Gr\\u00f6\\u00dfen 3, dann 5, dann fixe Ring\\nGr\\u00f6\\u00dfe 11, denn auch eine Ring Gr\\u00f6\\u00dfe von exakt 73 sticht auf der Blockchain\\nheraus und man kann von einem falsch konfiguriertem einzelnen Wallet/Script\\nausgehen. Aktuell sind es fixe 16. \\u2013 Betr\\u00e4ge waren bis 2017 auch offen\\nsichtbar, erst im Januar 2017 wurde RingCT eingef\\u00fchrt, Ende 2017 erfordert.\\nDamals war es noch ein ziemlich gro\\u00dfes Problem, da die Transaktionsgr\\u00f6\\u00dfe von\\nca. 1kB auf 13-14kB und auch die Verifizierung stark angestiegen ist, aber die\\nPrivatsph\\u00e4re war der Community wichtiger als diese Nachteile. Nach der\\nEinf\\u00fchrung von Bulletproofs und BP+ konnte beides signifikant (ca. 90%)\\ngesenkt werden und eine Standard-Tx wiegt aktuell ca. 1.3-1.4kB. BP++ sind im\\nReview Prozess und senken das noch weiter, wobei die Einsparungen wom\\u00f6glich\\nf\\u00fcr eine h\\u00f6here Ring Gr\\u00f6\\u00dfe draufgehen werden. \\u2013 Auch die IP Adresse des\\nSenders wird selbst ohne Tor/I2p gesch\\u00fctzt, mit einem Protokoll namens\\nDandelion, mittlerweile Dandelion++ welches eine Transaktion nur an eine Node\\naus allen Verbindungen propagiert, diese propagiert sie per Zufallsprinzip\\nauch nur an eine oder mehrere weitere, so wird selbst bei vielen Nodes\\nkontrolliert durch einen Betreiber die Festlegung, woher die Tx stammt, extrem\\nungenau. \\u2013 Die Selektion der Inputs f\\u00fcr die Ring Signaturen wurde mittels\\nDaten der offenen Bitcoin Blockchain und Daten der Monero Blockchain mit Ring\\nGr\\u00f6\\u00dfen 1 ermittelt, welche Outputs mit welcher Wahrscheinlichkeit genutzt\\nwerden. Hierbei sind neue Outputs \\u00fcberproportional vertreten und daher ist\\ndieser Angriff auch relativ effektiv. Wenn man andererseits nicht nach Alter\\nder Inputs gewichtet, die man in die Ring Signatur aufnimmt, kann man fast mit\\nSicherheit den neuesten Output als realen Spend annehmen. \\u2013 Mordinals analog\\nzu Ordinals sind auch auf der Monero Blockchain aufgepoppt, haben das tx_extra\\nFeld genutzt, welches eigentlich daf\\u00fcr gedacht war, einen Ersatz f\\u00fcr einige\\nScripting Funktionen zu bieten wie z.B. Return Adressen, da man ja keine\\nAbsenderadresse kennt. Die Community hat sich aber schnell darauf geeinigt,\\ndass wir keine Affenbilder auf der Blockchain haben wollen (die \\u00e4hnlich wie\\ndie aktuelle Atacke die Privatsph\\u00e4re einschr\\u00e4nken) und das tx_extra Feld wurde\\nim Daemon ganz ohne Hardfork auf eine Adressl\\u00e4nge + wenige Byte beschr\\u00e4nkt und\\nTransaktionen die das Limit nicht einhalten werden von upgedateten Nodes\\nschlichtweg ignoriert. Mordinals sind damit gestorben...\\n\\nFull Chain Membership Proofs wurden auf der MoneroKon letztes Jahr in Prag\\nvorgestellt, womit der Autor Luke Parker alle anwesenden ziemlich verbl\\u00fcfft\\nhat, denn es gab davor keine \\u00f6ffentliche Diskussion dazu.

Ich freue mich, wenn ich etwas hilfreiches beitragen kann!\\nNat\\u00fcrlich habe ich in meinem initialen Kommentar auch ein paar Sachen\\nvergessen...\\n\\nZur Privatsph\\u00e4re und deren Verbesserung: \\u2013 Erst vor ca. 2 Jahren wurden\\nTransaktionen wieder ein St\\u00fcck homogener, indem eine Transaktion immer\\nmindestens zwei Outputs haben muss. Warum? Eine Transaktion \\u201esend all\\u201c ist zu\\n>99% eine Transaktion an sich selbst, entweder an eine andere Wallet oder an\\neine B\\u00f6rse, denn eine Zahlung hat praktisch immer Wechselgeld, insbesondere\\nwenn in Fiat bepreist, aber auch durch Transaktionsgeb\\u00fchren bleibt 1 XMR eben\\nnicht mehr genau 1 XMR.\\n\\nMonero strebt auch stets nach Dezentralisierung, die noch schwerer zu erfassen\\nist, aber ganz sicher niemals bin\\u00e4r sein kann. Ist Bitcoin (noch) dezentral\\n(genug)? Monero hat da seinen ganz eigenen Weg genommen, nachdem es von\\nBitmain unterwandert und versteckt gemined wurde, bis sie aufgeflogen sind und\\ndann pl\\u00f6tzlich ihre Miner der \\u00d6ffentlichkeit vorgestellt haben... \\u2013 Monero,\\nwelches mit Cryptonight bis dahin als ASIC-proof gegolten hat, wurde eines\\nBesseren belehrt und Bitmain\\u2019s ASICs waren etwa 20x effizienter als die\\neffizientesten CPUs. Was hat man gemacht? Schnell geforkt, um die eingesetzten\\nASICs zu \\u201ebricken\\u201c, also unbrauchbar gemacht. Nur Bitmain wurde immer\\nschneller und Monero hat dann im 4-5 Monatstakt den Algorithmus geforked,\\ndamit Bitmain keinen neuen ASIC rausbringen kann, bis Howard Chu aka hyc_symas\\n\\u2013 Erfinder der LMDB Datenbankstruktur, die bei Monero verwendet wird seit man\\ngemerkt hat, dass LevelDB von Bitcoin einfach nicht ausreichend skalierbar ist\\n\\u2013 einen \\u201erandom\\u201c Code ins Spiel gebracht hat, der auf dem Hash des letzten\\nBlocks basiert. Zuerst war es RandomJS mit JavaScript Funktionen, welches dann\\nvon tevador und sech1 mit RandomX zur Perfektion getrieben wurde und seit 5\\nJahren keinerlei Update ben\\u00f6tigt hat, weil es nicht effizienter in Platinen\\nimplementierbar ist als mit modernen CPUs. \\u2013 Auch p2pool geh\\u00f6rt zum\\nDezentraliserungsbestreben und es ist genial. Ich kann es aber nicht fassen,\\ndass selbst nach \\u00fcber zwei Jahren immer noch weniger als 10% der Miner p2pool\\nnutzen, obwohl es keinerlei Geb\\u00fchren gibt und vor allem ist das Pool Mining\\nkomplett dezentralisiert, denn jeder Miner baut seinen Block selbst mit den\\nTransaktionen, die er aufnehmen will oder nicht. Nicht der Pool. W\\u00e4re\\neigentlich noch ein wichtigeres Thema f\\u00fcr Bitcoin als Monero, wo man\\nTransaktionen eh nicht voneinander unterscheiden kann, aber es ist ein starker\\nSchritt in Richtung Dezentraliserung.\\n\\nIch w\\u00fcnsche mir das alles immer noch bei Bitcoin... Selbst die ersten\\nHardcore-Verfechter bekommen es mittlerweile mit, dass LN viel zu komplex ist,\\nals dass es irgendwann mal breiter genutzt werden w\\u00fcrde.

But when they bring in like five dependencies that themselves ended up\\n> bringing in 150 additional transitive dependencies, everyone just says,\\n> \\\"Yeah, it looks good to me.\\\" And no one even opens the code up and looks at\\n> it. And some of these supply chain attacks - the bar is so low that if you\\n> just open up the file, you can often just see, there was no attempt made\\n> really to hide this.\\n\\nThis critical gap \\u2014 where developers install any packages they want to use but\\ndon\\u2019t thoroughly vet them, is what Socket was designed to secure. Many of\\nthese packages contain obvious security threats that would be easily\\nidentified with minimal examination, but the reality is nobody is reading all\\nthe code in their transitive dependencies.\\n\\nFeross explained how Socket uses static analysis and LLMs to provide real-time\\ndetection of supply chain attacks across hundreds of thousands of packages by\\ndownloading and reading the source code. By automating this crucial aspect of\\nsecuring open source code, Socket enables developers to build secure software\\nwith confidence, focusing their code review efforts where they matter most.\\n\\nListen to the episode on the Chinchilla Squeaks website, and check out the\\ntranscript below.\\n\\nTRANSCRIPT:\\n\\nChris: I'm Christian Chinchilla. Welcome to my podcast, an enthusiastic ramble\\nthrough whatever has taken my interest the past week or so. Expect technology,\\ngames, history, travel, geekery, and as always, much, much more.\\n\\nHello everybody, welcome to another chinchilla squeeze with me, Chris\\nChinchilla. This is an episode of interview show and my interview this episode\\nis one back from last year i think i have one more from last year after this\\none and it was with Feross from Socket.dev, one of the many companies involved\\nin software supply chain security. They have an interesting product that deals\\nwith vulnerabilities, but also provides visibility, reporting, policy\\nenforcement, and all of that. All these various different aspects of software\\nsupply chain security, not just looking at vulnerabilities and helping you\\nidentify and potentially fix those, but kind of the full gamut and with an\\ninteresting chat, an interesting product, one that I will probably look into a\\nvideo of soon.\\n\\nChris: You actually have quite an interesting story, but I think we should\\nprobably start a little bit with Socket first, and then, and then come back to\\nyou, maybe.\\n\\nSo Socket is in this fairly active, at the moment, space of software supply\\nchain security. Where do you fit into that wider landscape, which is growing,\\nso it's always interesting to know which part the companies in it think they\\nfit into the most.\\n\\nFeross: It's a great question because so many people use the word software\\nsupply chain.\\n\\nYou know, that phrase has become a bit of a marketing buzzword. So it's\\nimportant to really dig in and say, okay, what do you actually do? Yeah. What\\nwould, what would you say you do here?Socket is a developer first security\\ntool focused around dependencies and basically helping developers to pick\\ndependencies that are safe and secure.\\n\\nAnd then on the other hand, once dependencies have already been included in an\\napplication, we help the security team to understand the risk of those\\ndependencies, both in terms of vulnerabilities, which is traditionally been\\nwhat tools in the space focus on, but beyond vulnerabilities Socket also helps\\ndetect malicious dependencies and other types of risky dependencies.\\n\\nAnd there's a whole bunch of different angles when it comes to risk that we\\nlook at that go really far beyond what a traditional CVE scanning tools.\\n\\nChris: And you're right because I think a lot of other tools will look for\\njust known vulnerabilities in dependencies, but I'm getting the impression\\nthat you go further than that.\\n\\nIs that the case?\\n\\nFeross:\\n\\nCorrect. Yeah. Perfect example of the limitations of the known vulnerability\\napproach would be, say you have a developer on your team that makes a typo\\nwhen they're installing a package and they get one letter wrong. It turns out\\nthat a lot of these package managers like npm and pypi, they let anybody\\npublish packages under any name with really no vetting process at all.\\n\\nAnd so a simple mistake like a typo doing during an install command can bring\\nin untrusted code from a random publisher. And a lot of the times, I mean,\\nI've done this myself and I'm a very security conscious developer and what\\nwill happen is, you know, that code in many cases may run, you know, the\\nattacker's code immediately using something called an install script.\\n\\nThat's a huge risk. Just getting a typo there, but then say that package\\nactually ends up getting merged and it, you know, maybe it's just something\\nthat isn't very popular. You know, maybe it has a hundred downloads a week or\\nsomething like that. That's going to be something that almost certainly has no\\nknown vulnerabilities, but that doesn't mean it's because the package is safe.\\n\\nIt's because nobody's really bothered to look at it. You know, it's really\\nrelying on human researchers to actually care about. Doing the work to go and\\nlook at that package. And so that's one really big problem with the known\\nvulnerability approach is just, you know, it'll tell you, Hey, there's no\\nknown vulnerabilities, but that doesn't mean it's safe.\\n\\nChris: That's actually, that's actually a good point. Yeah. And, you know,\\nmuch like people squat on website domains that sound a little bit like other\\nwebsite domains that people might mistype. I would imagine there's a few\\npeople who probably less of a less lucrative, but, well, I suppose it depends,\\nbut squatting on.\\n\\nI don't react with a K. Or And all sorts of strange things like that. But I\\nalso noticed because you're So you've got these kind of five tabs of the\\nfeatures you cover. And we've mentioned the sort of vulnerability side, but\\nyou also cover things like licensing, which is often kind of a secondary\\nsecondary tool in the kind of policy tool chain for many companies, I think\\nfitting into what you said about the no known vulnerabilities because no one's\\nusing it.\\n\\nYou've also mentioned strange things that I wouldn't even think about here\\nwith licensing, like changing licensing, uh, mixed licensing, um, even\\nmaintenance, uh, deprecated, no bug tracker, again, that fits into the, you\\nknow, if no one's using it. Okay. It's safe, but that's because no one's\\ntouched it in five years.\\n\\nLike that doesn't make it any more safe. Yeah. So there's lots of little more\\nsubtleties to some of the things that you're doing that I haven't seen so much\\nin, in some of the others. Yeah. That wasn't really a question. That was more\\nof astatement.\\n\\nFeross: No, I mean, I think what we're doing is pretty unique.\\n\\nIt's, it's something that, you know, we got really interested in doing because\\nour whole team is open source maintainers. And so we've really seen the\\nproducer side of this equation. More than the consumer side. And so, you know,\\nI've seen my fair share of supply chain attacks that, you know, involve\\npackages getting compromised, hijacked in various ways.\\n\\nAnd one of the things that always disappointed me about the way that the\\ncommunity the security community handled it, is it, it always felt like it was\\nvery reactive. Waiting around for a happy accident for somebody to find that\\nbad code was added to one of these packages in one case, you know, the\\nmalicious code wasn't caught except for the fact that a new version of the\\nnode JS runtime had come out and it happened to deprecate.\\n\\nOne of the functions that the attacker used in their attack code. And then\\nthat started producing a deprecation warning. And then the developers traced\\nit, you know, community traced it back to, to the attack in, you know, in this\\npackage. So this package was actually, you know, was, was a compromise with\\nthe supply chain attack.\\n\\nBut, you know, it was like if five, six days until it was found and it was a\\ntotal accident that, that allowed the community to find it. And so it just, it\\njust seemed like, you know, we could write rules to detect these types of\\nthings. And, you know, we had seen enough of these attacks that, you know, it\\nfelt like we could.\\n\\nReally produce a pretty comprehensive set of, you know, what do attackers do\\nonce they get their hands on a package? And so because of that, we ended up\\nbuilding something that, you know, it really is a, it's pretty different in\\nthe, in the space of software composition analysis tools or SCA tools, which\\nis typically what this area is called.\\n\\nAnd, and yeah, so we do vulnerabilities of course, but because everybody does\\nthat and it's a, it's, you know, it's worth tracking that stuff, it's\\nimportant. But we also, we also do. Do a whole bunch of other things, but\\n\\nChris: actually something, another thing on the front page of your website,\\nI'd like to ask more about is, so you've mentioned that a lot of the time, a\\nlot of other companies in this space do sort of lean off of fairly large\\ndatabases of, of known vulnerabilities and then adds maybe some, some things\\non top of those.\\n\\nBut one thing you're saying here is real time, how, without giving too much\\naway, how are you managing to do. Real time across, you know, the hundreds of\\nthousands of potential sources of that real time information.\\n\\nFeross: Great question, and I'm happy to share it. We've been pretty open\\nabout how we do this. So the first step is we, you know, we need to have a\\ncopy of all the source code of, of all the, all the dependencies that you\\nmight possibly use.\\n\\nUm, this is something that all those known vulnerability vendors don't do.\\nThey really just have a database of these known issues, uh, that says, Hey,\\nthis version is bad. Here's the version you got to update to, but they, you\\nknow, that's basically a human curated database that's maintained by the\\nfederal government, actually in the U S uh, the national vulnerability\\ndatabase is what it's called and basically, every vendor just downloads that\\nand resells it in various ways.\\n\\nWhat we do is we start from the source of truth, which is what is the code\\ngoing to do when you, when you run it, you know, and, and we download all that\\nopen source code. And then we, we start by running a static analysis over it\\nusing our own in house static analysis engine. And we look for a bunch of\\nthings, things like what is this package's capabilities?\\n\\nDoes it read files? Does it access the network? Does it create child\\nprocesses? Does it contain. High entropy blobs of code indicating that there\\nmight be obfuscated code or or minified code added that is trying to hide what\\nit's doing by being, you know, by obfuscating itself like that, you know, that\\ntype of thing.\\n\\nAnd And so if you see a package that has been around in the community for five\\nyears, and suddenly now there's a new patch release that's come out that needs\\nto access the network and open up, you know, run some shell commands and\\ndownload an exe file, then like probably it's worth having a human take a look\\nat that.\\n\\nAnd so the product will, will tell companies that, and if they'd like to just\\nbe told anytime a package, you know, has the use of use of certain\\ncapabilities, we can do that. We can send them an alert and say. Hey, you\\nknow, this is a new package that's using the network and, and they can, they\\ncan then, you know, review it themselves if they'd like.\\n\\nAnd that's very easy to do in a real time sense, because we have all this\\ncode. And when, whenever we see a new package get published, we immediately\\nscan it. So we just have a whole bunch of worker servers that are sitting\\naround doing this. And if there does happen to be, for example, some package\\nthat we haven't scanned and a customer asks us about it through our API or\\nthrough an integration, we can actually just.\\n\\nAnd now analyze it on demand for them and give, give them the results. So, so\\nwe're, we're, we're always scanning stuff and looking for these, for these\\ntypes of risks. But then the next step we do for, for a lot of teams, they\\ndon't want to have, they don't want to waste the time of their developers to\\nactually review these, these potentially potential risks, malicious changes or\\nthese potentially risky changes. They just want us to tell them when we find\\nsomething that's bad in their dependencies and to stop it from getting in the\\nfirst place. And so to do that, we, we actually introduced and apologies. It's\\ngoing to sound like I'm using buzzwords and stuff here because I'm going to\\nsay AI, and I'm going to say LLMs, but we actually found a pretty cool use for\\nLLMs here, which is that rather than just, you know, throwing a chat bot\\ninterface onto our existing product like, like a lot of people are doing and\\ncalling it AI or even, you know, introducing some summarization or something\\nlike that into the product. We, we actually use the LLM in a way as a security\\nresearcher intern. So how I like to think about it, like we have this, this\\nLLM that can look at code, it can describe what it's going to do, even if it's\\nobfuscated and it can say, this is the data source.\\n\\nThis is the data sync. This is what the code seems to be doing. And then we\\ncan kind of get it to say, like, does it seem like it's malicious potentially.\\nAnd if it does, if it does determine that it does have a, it does have a\\nnotion of maliciousness and it's not perfect and there are a ton of false\\npositives, but if it does think that something is malicious, we can actually\\nlook into it further.\\n\\nAnd that's actually allowed us to cut down on, on, you know, instead of having\\nour human team reviewing, You know, the 7 million NPM package versions that\\nhave been published. We can have our team focusing on, on, on stuff that just\\nseems very, very high risk and do that approach. We've actually been able to\\nfind around 400 malicious packages that are published every week that we take,\\nwe get taken down from NPM and PyPI and we protect all of our customers.\\n\\nAnd while we're in parallel, trying to get those taken down. Yeah. So. So\\nyeah, there's a human in the loop and, and, you know, and so it's not, you\\nknow, it's not going to be like instant instant if you, if you do want that\\nhuman in a loop, but for, for some teams, they they're paranoid enough that\\nthey're willing to say, you know, what, like any package that the AI thinks is\\nsuspicious, like just.\\n\\nJust block it until we've had a chance to look at it. And then even more\\nparanoid people will go in and say, look, anything that's touching the\\nnetwork, anything that's using the file system, any of these capabilities that\\nare sensitive also, you know, put those into a, you know, into a review before\\nletting them in.\\n\\nSo just really what risk level you want to accept. And so some of those are\\nmore instant than others. Obviously the. human in the loop on our end is\\ngonna, it takes a little bit of time, but we're pretty fast. So yeah, does\\nthat make sense?\\n\\nChris: You know, for sure. I just wondered, though, I think this is leading a\\nlittle bit towards your, your background and how you got here, which we'll\\ncome to next.\\n\\nBut so you, as far as I can see, you are currently And I think this is\\npossibly relating to a lot of the kind of extras you're adding on top. You\\nsupport NPM, Go, Maven, PyPi packages. Whereas a lot of other vendors might\\nalso have things like containers and I don't know, any, I honestly can't think\\nof many other, I suppose, crates or something, you know, you know, there's a\\nlot of other things that they also support, but I guess that slightly more.\\n\\nYou're going for a slightly more curated experience, but are there, are there\\nthings that are next on the list to, to add to those four sources?\\n\\nFeross: Yeah, for sure. The number one request we have right now is more\\nlanguage support. And so it's, our main priority is getting more languages so\\nthat when we come into a company, we can protect all their repos.\\n\\nBut I will say that one of the things that I'm proud of is that we're very\\nfocused on doing this. One thing and doing it really well. And since it is\\nsomething that no one elseis really doing in the way we are. I think it's been\\nreceived pretty well by the market because they, they see that, Oh, you know\\nwhat, this is a gap that we have, you know, we're letting our developers\\ninstall whatever packages they want.\\n\\nAnd we're not even, you know, in a weird way, the teams actually tend to\\nreview the source code of their teammates, you know, more, more thoroughly,\\nbecause when you, when you open a pull request, you get to see the code that\\nthey wrote and you get to review it and leave comments on it. But when they\\nbring in like five dependencies that themselves ended up bringing in.\\n\\nYou know, 150 additional transitive dependencies. Everyone just says, yeah, it\\nlooks good to me. And no one even opens the code up and look, looks at it. And\\nsome of these supply chain attacks are so like the bar is so low that if you\\njust open up the file, you can often just see, there was no attempt made\\nreally to hide this.\\n\\nThey'll just drop a giant blob of high entropy, you know, encrypted code that\\ngets evaluated at runtime right into the bottom of some file. And it's like,\\nif you just looked at that, you would have seen it, but no one's doing that.\\nAnd, and I mean, and so. To answer to answer your question, I think, I mean,\\nat some point we, you know, we, we will expand further into, into different\\nareas, but one of the things that.\\n\\nI'd like to be careful of is you see a lot of security companies do this where\\nthey'll basically go for breadth and then, and they'll do this through\\nacquiring startups and kind of poorly integrating everything together just so\\nthey can say that they have this coverage, but in reality it doesn't really\\nwork that well.\\n\\nAnd, and so our approach, I mean, Our whole team is open source maintainers.\\nWe, we really pride ourselves on our craft. I don't think we want to go down\\nthe route of, of building, you know, low quality enterprise software and just\\nselling it to executives. And then the executives forced the developers to use\\nit, even though it's terrible to use.\\n\\nAnd it makes everybody upset. You know, that's definitely, that would be so\\nagainst our, the way we would want to do things that, you know, we're going\\nto, we're probably going to take a more, Careful approach than that.\\n\\nChris: And for the most part, it seems like your main interface is a, is a\\nGitHub app. So I guess it sits on those aforementioned pull requests and, and\\ndigs a little deeper.\\n\\nFeross: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, we do have an API and, uh, and other,\\nbut, but, but yeah, the GitHub app is definitely the quickest way to get\\ngoing. It's a two click install. You just, you Click it. It comes from the\\nGitHub marketplace and then you pick the repos you want to protect and then\\nthat's it. And then we start, we start scanning all the repos, no changes\\nneeded, needed to CI or CD, no tech, you know, developers to go and do a bunch\\nof work to add it to every repo and that type of thing.\\n\\nChris: And I, I wonder if this is a little bit, you know, you, you have NPM,\\nGo, Maven, PyPy, but PyPy, I can never remember what it is. And especially\\nwith Go and Maven, that's sort of a lot of backend code, but you are sort of\\npushing the JavaScript first, uh, quite a bit. And when I look at, and this\\ncomes to your background a little bit, but I also see some of your clients\\nlike Figma, Versal, Next. js, sort of same people, Brave, Metamask, Storybook,\\na lot of very much front end JavaScript people. So it sort of feels like\\nthat's definitely the world that you've, you've captivated first anyway. And\\nof course, whenever we think of packages, we tend to think of JavaScript\\nfirst, even though it's not an original concept, of course.\\n\\nBut that tends to be the stereotype of where we think so is, is a lot of that\\njust because that's the world that you've come from and we can talk about some\\nof your projects in a minute, but is it, was it sort of JavaScript first and\\nthen the others came later or.\\n\\nFeross: Yeah, we started with JavaScript first for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nOne, that's the community that a lot of us came from, so it was easier to get\\nadoption there to begin with. But the other big reason, and honestly, even if\\nwe came from another community, We would have started with JavaScript first\\nbecause it's the largest ecosystem. And it's also had the most, you know, high\\nprofile incidents and the most supply chain attacks, frankly, because it has a\\nvery, what's the word permissive and welcoming culture where there's very few\\nbarriers to entry.\\n\\nI would say, you know, npm was one of the first package managers to create\\nlike a one line, kind of a one command publish. You just type npm publish.\\nThere's no signing step. There's no keys to set up. There's nobody to approve\\nyour packages. You just, it's just, you can register whatever name you want\\nwith one line with a one line command in your terminal.\\n\\nAnd for that reason, I think they, they were super successful at getting\\npeople to publish to npm. And that's why it's one of the reasons why it's the\\nlargest, you know, package manager by far. I'll say the other, the other\\nreason that npm, uh, both became one of the largest and also has sort of the\\nmost attacks that we hear about all the time is because of this culture of\\nsmall packages.\\n\\nAnd I would say this came about for, I think it's a kind of interesting\\nreason, which is that it's funny, the phrase dependency, hell, It used to mean\\none thing. And now people think of it as they think of npm as dependency hell,\\nbecause it's like, you know, you have a thousand dependencies when you just\\nget hello world working on your website.\\n\\nAnd, but the dependency hell used to mean something else. And npm was actually\\nthe solution to dependency hell, believe it or not. The dependency hell used\\nto mean, used to mean a specific thing. It was when you had, if I have package\\nA in my project and it depends on package C. And let's say at version 1.0, I\\nneed package C at version 1. 0. And then I add package B to my project. And B\\nalso happens to have a dependency on C, but it's version two of C. Now I have\\na problem where I have a, and I have B and they both need C, but they need\\ndifferent versions of C. And it turns out that like almost every package\\nmanager that came before NPM, maybe all, I don't know, but every single one\\nthat I've, I've ever used before NPM would just, the package manager would\\nthrow up its hands and say, Sorry, you know, I can't we can't install this\\nbecause you need two versions of C pick one and and the problem is it's not\\nlike it's even in your control.\\n\\nYou're not even using C. You don't even know what C is. C is a dependency of\\nyour dependencies. So now you're just in a situation where you're screwed and\\nthere's nothing you can do. And so NPM said, Hey, this is really dumb. Let's\\njust install both versions of C. We'll install version one and we'll install\\nversion two.\\n\\nYeah, and then it says we'll just give version one to A and we'll give version\\ntwo to B and now everybody gets the version that they want. Now it's not a\\nperfect solution because in some cases you might end up with objects.\\nDuplication of code. You might end up with an object that you create in, you\\nknow, create.\\n\\nIf A returns the raw, like, Object that C produces and it's a version one of\\nthat object that might not be compatible with a version two of that object\\nThat's coming from the other library, but in in general it kind of just works\\nto do this um And so it solved dependency hell, which was getting yourself\\ninto an incompatible situation where you can't proceed but the flip the the\\neffect of that was that now suddenly There's no downside as a maintainer For\\nadding additional dependencies.\\n\\nIt used to be that you'd have to worry that you were going to create\\ndependency health for your users by adding dependencies, but now you can just\\nadd like a hundred dependencies and you'll never create a situation where your\\nusers won't be able to install your package.\\n\\nChris: So including now when we get to NPM trying to install Python and C\\ndependencies, which is where it gets really weird.\\n\\nAnyway, that's a separate, definitely a separate conversation. And I feel like\\nI've had that conversation with someone on the show before, but let's just, I\\nwould really like to, to know. How you got to where you are, because you've\\nbeen around open source for a little while. I can see some of the things that\\nintrigued me.\\n\\nYou've got this MIDI player. I've been experimenting a lot with MIDI and music\\nXML again recently. So I've been going back down the MIDI path for the first\\ntime in ages, but that's probably not your best known ones. You have a\\nWebTorrent client and standard JS, which definitely does ring some bells. And\\nthat's Starguide. and Linting. I am actually super into Starguides and\\nLinting. Mostly, actually, with English language, I help maintain Some tools\\nin, in that department. And I can start to see how that might have led you\\ntowards something like Socket. But I don't see a complete path through some of\\nthese projects into something like Socket.\\n\\nSo how did you, how did you get there and why? What, what, what, what was the\\nepiphany, the nightmare that you had that made you want to go down this path?\\n\\nFeross: Yeah, you know, it's hard to connect the dots sometimes for how I\\narrived at this place. But I will say that. You know, I got obsessed with a\\nweb torrent and this idea of building a torrent client that works in the\\nbrowser and that project really Was my main thing from, from, you know, most\\nof my twenties, honestly, like, and, and one of the things that you learn with\\npeer to peer projects is that security is actually really important because\\nyou're dealing with peers on the network that you don't trust.\\n\\nSo you always have to think about security from the very beginning. It's not\\nsomething you can, you can add on later. Um, and so that's always been kind of\\nthere. And then also that project is what got me into being an open source\\nmaintainer. So while building that, I ended up making standard JS to mostly\\njust to prevent people from sending me PRs, which were mostly good, but then\\nhad a bunch of problems stylistically or didn't handle errors and things like\\nthat, that I could catch with a linter.\\n\\nAnd, and so before I knew it, I found myself maintaining about a hundred\\npackages on NPM and it's one of these things where you start off and you're\\nlike, Hooray. Like, you know, I have these users using my code. It's so cool.\\nLike, I, I feel like, you know, I'm doing useful work for the world, but\\neventually you end up, you end up overburdened with, with, when you get enough\\nusers of, of your, of your project and you're just a single maintainer.\\n\\nAnd so you end up adding other people to help you end up really just having\\nmore issues than you can fix and, and, and, and, and so a lot of, a lot of\\nquestions start to come up when, when, when, when you are maintaining stuff,\\nwhich is like, how do I trust this additional person to, should I give them\\naccess to the package or not?\\n\\nI mean, I, I have a, I have history of maintaining this in a certain way. And\\nif I add this additional person, they could just take it in a completely\\ndifferent direction. They could be a bad actor, especially if I've never met\\nthem in person before. I don't know who they are. And so we, you know, I had a\\nfriend who this happened to and, and in 2017, it was, it was very, pretty big\\nincident in the NPM community where the event stream package was hacked.\\n\\nYou might've remembered this basically happened that, And a maintainer was\\nadded to a package and he pretended to be good for about a month and made\\nreally good changes and then eventually put in a backdoor that targeted a\\nspecific company. And so, you know, seeing kind of the way that, you know, the\\nway that maintainers do things, but then also just seeing that, that all these\\ncompanies, these fortune 500 companies were using my code when I was like a 20\\nsomething year old, you know, that was also very, very humbling.\\n\\nAnd it made me realize that these companies don't really know what's in their\\nsupply chains. They're just pulling in this code. Their developers\\nspecifically are pulling in this code and hoping For the best. And so it got\\nme interested in kind of supply chains and security and how do we trust the\\ncode that we're using?\\n\\nAnd, and yeah, and then the final kind of nail in the coffin that made, that\\npushed me over the edge to want to work on, on this company socket was my,\\nmyself and two other people were building this product called the wormhole.\\nWormhole. app is the URL. Oh\\n\\nChris: yeah. It sounds like a, it's like an ngrok type.\\n\\nFeross: No.\\n\\nIt's a file transfer tool for like sending files across the web to other\\nfolks. Yeah. Was it IPFS based or no? He uses WebTorrent under the hood.\\n\\nChris: Oh, WebTorrent. Okay. I might have come across it when I was messing\\naround more with the decentralized crypto world.\\n\\nYeah. Oh, or maybe we used it. Oh, I can't remember. It definitely rings a\\nbell, but anyway. Yep. Yep.\\n\\nFeross: Yeah. So it's, it's basically a way to, it's like Firefox send. If\\nanybody remembers that, that tool, you drop your files on the browser, you get\\na link, you send it to somebody, they can download the files, but it has a\\ncouple of really important attributes.\\n\\nOne is it's end to end encrypted. The, the link automatically expires and the,\\nthe files are streamable, meaning that, uh, even before they finished\\nuploading. So like within a second of you dropping the files on the page. You\\nget a URL that you can send. And that means that the recipients can actually\\nstart streaming the files from you, meaning like the encryption is streaming.\\n\\nAnd if they were to say, click on a video that you're trying to send them,\\nthey could seek the video to halfway through the video. And even if you've\\nonly uploaded like 0. 1%, it smartly reprioritizes the part of the file that\\nyou're uploading to. Yeah. So it's pretty, it basically gives them the video\\nthat they need and uses it's peer to peer too.\\n\\nSo it can, it can literally. Directly send this to them without going through\\nthe server. But then, you know, if, if they, you know, if, if you, if you\\nfinish the upload, then of course, you know, you can then shut your browser\\ndown and then they'll be able to use the link even after you've, you've gone\\nfor up to 24 hours.\\n\\nSo it's kind of a hybrid between a traditional, like file hosting thing where\\nyou'd upload the files and a peer to peer system where they can, you know, get\\nthe performance benefits. It's kind of sad.\\n\\nChris: Cause it sort of feels like there was a lot. More call for these sorts\\nof very clever peer to peer sharing applications a few years ago, and now\\npeople don't really use them as much anymore because internet is better or\\nwhatever the reason may be.\\n\\nAnd I don't know, I feel like we used to be clever about file sharing in the\\npast.\\n\\nFeross: I feel the same way, although I still have to say, it's, it's funny\\nhow much Dropbox and Google drive still actually haven't, haven't innovated in\\nthis area. I mean, If you're trying to send somebody like, you know, a 10 gig\\nfile, you do, you do really have to wait for like a while to upload in the\\nmeantime, you can't get a link to send.\\n\\nChris: That is true, actually. Yeah. No, anyway, I feel like, so just out of\\ninterest, because we're running a little bit out of time, but for anyone who\\nfound this interesting, you do come from open source background. You do have\\nan open source. Yes. Which is pretty generous. I think the only thing that's\\nmissing that could be useful on the free open source tier is license\\nenforcement, but I'm not sure how much open source developers would really\\nneed that more beyond just being, you know, very strict open source license\\npeople.\\n\\nSo there's definitely a lot people can play with. If we were to speak in six\\nto 12 months, what have you got on the roadmap next?\\n\\nFeross: Way more programming languages supported. You mentioned that. Yeah.\\nYeah. And we'll have a lot more. Analyses, different things we're going to be\\nlooking for, hopefully better coverage of different types of threats that\\nwe're seeing, so that's going to keep improving.\\n\\nOverall, we want to make the website we have today is pretty useful for a\\ndeveloper just to go and search packages and see like what the risks there are\\nand just kind of what, what they need to know about a package before they\\ninstall it. And one of the things we want to do is keep improving that so that\\nit's really the best place to start when you're looking for open source\\npackages.\\n\\nChris: Well, it's, it's also, you'll be pleased to hear. I see that they're\\none of your customers, but have also supported you a lot through some of your\\nprojects. I have been using Brave the whole time. So it's just, it's during\\nthis, during this call, which is also sort of nice to see that people have\\ncome with you on your journey as well.\\n\\nFeross: So the Brave team is great. They're just really good people and, and\\nit's a, it's an important product, I think. It's a really interesting browser.\\nIt has so many things in it. It does. It does a lotof experiments.\\n\\nChris: I will mostly use Safari, but if I have to use a Chromium browser, I\\nwill only use Brave.\\n\\nI won't use Chrome, that's for sure. But anyway.\\n\\nFeross: Brave has WebTorrentbuilt in, by the way.\\n\\nChris: Yes, it does. You're right, actually. I've never really had a need to\\nuse it, but I have seen the setting. Yes.\\n\\nFeross: Yeah, if you click on a torrent link, it'll suggest that you enable\\nWebTorrent and then You can, uh, torrent directly in the browser without\\nneeding a third party app.\\n\\nChris: I was wondering what project they'd supported you with and now that\\nmakes sense then. Okay. Yes.\\n\\nFeross: Yes.\\n\\nChris: Well, thank you very much for joining me and I don't normally tell\\npeople this in the recording, but seeing as it's very appropriate, I'm going\\nto hit stop and stay on the line because we need to let the stream finish.\\n\\nAnd that was my interview with Feross from Socket.

His parents filed for\\nbankruptcy when he was just five years old and divorced shortly thereafter. In\\nthe years that followed, Adam\\u2019s life was a bit turbulent. He would bounce\\naround between different schools and different condominiums where he lived\\nwith his mother, sister, and whoever his mother was dating at the time. Though\\nhis living situation at home wasn\\u2019t unbearable, there wasn\\u2019t much money to go\\naround. His lowest point was living in a cockroach-infested condo where he\\nwould regularly steal napkins from fast food restaurants to save money for his\\nfamily.\\n\\nEventually, Adam moved out of that cockroach-infested condo and into a real\\nhouse when he was in middle school. And though this was a step up for Adam\\u2019s\\nliving situation, it was a step down for his schooling situation. The high\\nschool Adam would eventually attend was in the top 100 for most dropouts in\\nthe state. Nevertheless, Adam studied hard, got good grades, and got into a\\ngreat college.\\n\\nNow let\\u2019s turn our attention to my friend Benjamin. Benjamin grew up with a\\nnice middle class lifestyle. Though his parents also divorced when he was\\nyoung, Benjamin\\u2019s father and extended family were heavily involved in his\\nlife. In fact, his mother and father got along so well that they would\\nsometimes attend each others\\u2019 family functions alongside Benjamin. As a result\\nof this, Benjamin had a great childhood with lots of love and emotional\\nsupport.\\n\\nAnd while Benjamin\\u2019s family didn\\u2019t have a ton of money, there were moments of\\nfinancial prosperity. For example, when Benjamin was in high school he lived\\nin a three story house, had a big screen TV, and his parents owned a sports\\ncar. This nice lifestyle provided immense stability for Benjamin to do well in\\nschool. As a result, he graduated valedictorian of his high school class and\\ngot into a great college.\\n\\nHere we have two stories about two people with two seemingly different\\nupbringings. But what if I told you that, despite their differences, Adam and\\nBenjamin went to the same university, got similar jobs after college, and have\\nhad roughly similar lifetime earnings? What would you say to that? How would\\nthat make you feel? Are Adam and Benjamin equally deserving of their success?\\nOr does background matter when taking into account one\\u2019s achievements?\\n\\nYou probably already have your answers to these questions. But, I have a\\nconfession to make\\u2014Adam and Benjamin aren\\u2019t two of my friends. They aren\\u2019t\\neven two different people. They are both me.\\n\\nYes, every detail about Adam and Benjamin\\u2019s lives come from my life. I just\\nselectively chose what to tell you about each of them. For Adam, I emphasized\\nthe struggles I had growing up, but with Benjamin I emphasized the immense\\nprivileges I had that most others don\\u2019t. Neither story is more true, they are\\nboth biased in their own way.\\n\\nBut think about how often this happens without you knowing about it. How many\\nstories do we hear from people who overemphasize their struggles and downplay\\ntheir privileges to shape their image?\\n\\nFor example, there is a part in the David and Victoria Beckham documentary,\\nwhere Victoria talks about how she grew up \\u201cworking class.\\u201d That\\u2019s when David\\nbarges in and says \\u201cBe honest...What car did your Dad drive you to school in?\\u201d\\nTo which Victoria begrudgingly replies, \\u201cIn the 1980s my dad had a Rolls\\nRoyce.\\u201d\\n\\nMany people want to downplay what advantages they had growing up to make\\nthemselves seem more deserving of their current lifestyle. They are always\\ntrying to seem less privileged then they really are (or were). For example\\nwhen you ask people, \\u201cTo which social class do you belong?\\u201d only 1%-2% will\\never answer \\u201cupper class\\u201d even though the upper class includes the top 5% of\\nthe wealth spectrum.\\n\\nPeople will also downplay their advantages when they are trying to sell you\\nsomething, especially in the financial space. Just think about how many\\nfinancial influencers tell their \\u201crags\\u201d to riches story as evidence of how to\\nget rich, only to sell you on how to get rich as well. Unfortunately, often\\nthe only thing being sold is their story.\\n\\nAfter all, wouldn\\u2019t you rather listen to the person who was \\u201cbroke\\u201d and then\\ngot rich over the person who was already rich and then came up with a system\\nto get rich? It seems logical that the broke-to-rich person\\u2019s advice is\\nprobably better than the rich-to-rich person\\u2019s advice. But how would you know?\\nYou wouldn\\u2019t.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not saying that every person who went from nothing to something is lying.\\nOf course not, but I am saying that many of them are probably overemphasizing\\ntheir struggles to help their cause. Why? Because it makes a better story.\\nBecause it sells better.\\n\\nHowever, I don\\u2019t think that someone\\u2019s current financial standing or background\\nshould hold much weight when determining whether their advice is useful. Just\\nbecause someone is rich doesn\\u2019t imply that they know how they got rich. The\\nsame goes for someone who was \\u201cpoor\\u201d and then became rich. After all, you\\ncould\\u2019ve gotten rich in a different way than what you claim publicly.\\n\\nWhat we should do instead is judge the advice based on its own merits. Could\\nthis advice have worked for other people? Does it have any evidence of doing\\nso? This is what ultimately matters, not how broke/rich its creator was.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I know this line of logic won\\u2019t sway most people. Because most\\npeople do care about someone\\u2019s financial background and story before they will\\nlisten to them. It\\u2019s only natural to want proof of work. But, before you go\\nall-in on someone else\\u2019s advice, make sure you know why.\\n\\nBecause it may not be their advice that is selling you, but their story.

Well, through training a LoRA on\\ntheir work, you can totally do that! There are so many different levers to\\nflip when training a LoRA, though, and it can be a little intimidating to\\ndetermine how to even start, especially because training on a large number of\\nepochs can take several hours even on high-spec pods. Although creating LoRAs\\nwill always involve a lot of testing and experimentation, here's how to get\\nyourself started so you can get to the tweaking and fine-tuning steps.\\n\\n## Step 1: Accumulate a Corpus of Text\\n\\nIf you'd like to train a LoRA on a specific author, you'll need to get as much\\ntext as is feasible from them. To train a LoRA on a 7b model, you'll want to\\nshoot for at least 1MB of raw text if possible (approximately 700 pages.) For\\nlarger models, even more text is better. Project Gutenberg and The Internet\\nArchive have tons of public domain books, downloadable in plain text, to get\\nyourself started. Alternatively, if you have .pdfs of books, you can convert\\nthose to plain text as well. (If you are intent on distributing LoRAs trained\\non authors, though, I do implore you to source your data responsibly!)\\n\\nFor this example, I've accumulated approximately 800 pages of Vladimir\\nNabokov's work over three books and saved them to a plain .txt file.\\n\\n## Step 2: Start up an LLM Pod on RunPod\\n\\nStart up a pod in our Secure or Community Cloud with the TheBloke LLM\\ntemplate. You won't need a lot of disk space (about 30-40 GB should do for a\\n7b model) but you will want at least 48GB of VRAM.\\n\\n## Step 3: Transfer a Model and Your Corpus\\n\\nYou'll need to first download your model. When starting out, you'll definitely\\nwant to stick to unquantized models (so no GPTQ, etc.) You'll also need to be\\nsure that you can load the model in 8-bit, which is why you'll need the extra\\nVRAM. First, download the model by cd'ing into the text-generation-webui\\nfolder in Terminal and running the following:\\n\\npython3 download-model.py NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-hf\\n\\nThen, you'll need to transfer your text to the /training/datasets folder. If\\nyou can host your .txt somewhere on the Internet, you can simply do a wget to\\nthat URL from that folder and it will download straight to that folder. Else,\\nif it's on your local PC, you can transfer it through runpodctl instead.\\n\\n## Step 4: Start Training!\\n\\nNow, it's time to start training your LoRAs. First, make sure the model is\\nloaded in 8 bit by ensuring the load-in-8bit checkbox is checked, and then\\nclick Load.\\n\\nThen, click on the Training tab. Wow, there's a lot of options there! However,\\nI've highlighted the truly important ones:\\n\\nName: The name of the LoRA. You'll want to follow a certain naming convention\\nwhile you train them to keep them organized (shown below.)\\n\\nEpochs: The number of times your dataset is run against the model.\\n\\nLearning Rate: How much the LoRA learns from each training run. Think of this\\nas how slowly the dataset is being read during the training process. You know\\nhow when you read a book more slowly in real life, you remember more of it?\\nIt's basically that. Think of an epoch as reading a book cover to cover, and\\nthe learning rate is how quickly you do that.\\n\\nLoRA Rank: Think of this as similar to the Temperature control when generating\\ntext. This is how deeply the LoRA applies what it's taught. A lower rank value\\nmeans that the LoRA will only take stylistic cues, while a higher rank value\\nmeans it also learns things like facts and vocabulary. As a rule of thumb, set\\nLoRA Alpha to be twice the rank.\\n\\nAs you go through and train LoRAs, be sure to create them with descriptive\\nnames so you can keep them separated from each other. I recommend using a\\nconvention like this:\\n\\nSo the first one would be 3 epochs, a learning rate of 3e-4, and a rank of 16.\\n\\n### Evaluating your LoRAs\\n\\nWith textual LoRAs, there's a lot of trial and error due to so many x-y\\nfactors involved with the training data as well as the model you are training\\nit on. So there are two criteria you'll want to keep in mind:\\n\\n1.) How well does it adhere to the spirit of the dataset text?\\n\\n2.) How coherent is it while applying that spirit?\\n\\nThe only way to find that out is to start training.\\n\\nBy way of example, I loaded Llama-2-7b and prompted the example assistant in\\ntext-generation-webui (Chiharu) with the following query: Tell me a story\\nabout a young girl in simple, easy to understand English. The intention is to\\nget simple, easy to understand text that contrasts with the complicated prose\\nin the Nabokov training text.\\n\\nBaseline:\\n\\n> When I was little, my mother told me stories about princesses who lived far\\n> away from their homes, fighting against monsters and evil people. They were\\n> strong women, brave enough to face danger head-on without fear or\\n> hesitation. Those stories inspired me to become someone like them. Someone\\n> who could stand up for herself no matter what happened around her, even if\\n> it meant putting herself at risk.\\n\\nSimple, easy to read text, like you might see in a grade school text. For\\nreference, here's a snippet from the training text to give you an idea of the\\ndifference in style:\\n\\n> Then, still ignoring the raincoated phantasm that had stopped in midstairs,\\n> master walked into a cozy boudoir across the hall from the drawing room,\\n> through which--taking it easy, knowing he was safe--I now went away from\\n> him, and in a bar-adorned kitchen gingerly unwrapped dirty Chum, talking\\n> care not to leave any oil stains on the chrome--I think I got the wrong\\n> product, it was black and awfully messy. In my usual meticulous way, I\\n> transferred naked Chum to a clean recess about me and made for the little\\n> boudoir. My step, as I say, was springy--too springy perhaps for success.\\n> But my heart pounded with tiger joy, and I crunched a cocktail glass\\n> underfoot.\\n\\nSo what do we get when we train a LoRA on this text and ask it for a simple\\nstory?\\n\\n3 epochs, learning rate 3e-4, rank 16:\\n\\n> Once upon a time there lived an adorably cute little girl who loved\\n> everything pink and purple. She would spend hours daydreaming of all the\\n> wonderful things she wanted to buy someday--beautiful dresses, dolls, teddy\\n> bears, shoes...the list went on and on forever! One day while walking\\n> through town she met some very special people who had a huge store filled\\n> with every single thing she could possibly dream of owning. They offered to\\n> give her anything she liked if only she would come live with them inside\\n> their magical shop full of treasures. The little girl agreed without\\n> hesitation because nothing mattered more than being surrounded by beautiful\\n> objects everywhere she turned. And thus began life inside the shop where she\\n> could play at will until late into the night.\\n\\nNot much has changed in the vocabulary or style. We are, however, starting to\\nsee the double hyphen (and later, parenthetical asides) that Nabokov was very\\nfond of.\\n\\n3 epochs, learning rate 3e-4, rank 128:\\n\\n> Once upon a time there lived a sweet and kind little girl. The sun shone\\n> brightly down as she danced across the meadow barefoot. Her golden brown\\n> hair whirled all around her and tiny birds flitted among them, twittering\\n> happily. As she ran her hands lovingly through their feathers they sang\\n> louder and brighter than ever before, filling her heart with joy! Oh if only\\n> those dear ones might remain in this state eternally. \\\"Oh, Wynne,\\\" moaned\\n> her grandfather who sat next door smoking his pipe; \\\"such a pity.\\\"\\n\\nThe language is becoming a bit more verbose. But looking at the next..\\n\\n3 epochs, learning rate 3e-4, rank 256:\\n\\n> It was a cold winter evening, but 4 year old Lilly still refused to wear\\n> shoes even though there were snow flurries blown across Main Street. Her\\n> mother kept insisting; her father, an aspiring actor, had gone somewhere to\\n> perform at night. She walked barefoot toward their neighbor's house, whose\\n> porch light seemed more inviting than those of other houses on that lonely\\n> block because it reminded Lily of candied peels. But before she got closer\\n> (and perhaps just to tease herself), she looked down again--at her little\\n> naked feet--which were getting colder with each passing minute. Then,\\n> without saying a word, she began running towards another home which had a\\n> brightly lit chimney, hoping to hear someone else singing Christmas carols.\\n\\nWe are seeing a huge jump in Nabakov-ness with the parentheticals, hyphens,\\nand character descriptiveness. With this data set, it appears that Rank 256\\nprovides the best balance between coherence and spirit. The language is\\ncomplicated, owing to the thick prose in the training text, but it tells a\\nstory that follows smoothly from one sentence to the next.\\n\\n3 epochs, learning rate 3e-4, rank 512:\\n\\n> Okay. It was in the spring. This tiny fellow (I am small) and I (she is\\n> small too) sat side by side on some damp sand near a rocky seaport clad in\\n> an old shabby raincoat and a pair of ancient rubbers. The waves broke lazily\\n> against stones at his feet and beyond their brown crest the town glittered\\n> greenly on its hill, between the dark harbor basin and the azure ocean\\n> stretching away forever towards China. A red balloon floated high overhead\\n> while the shadow under our little feet grew longer each minute, slowly\\n> enveloping and blotting out the whole world; and neither of us moved despite\\n> its increasing warmth nor made even the slightest gesture or sound, though a\\n> million words were burning to rush forth.\\n\\nAgain, it's clear that the training text is really having a huge effect on how\\nthe text is being output. There are parentheticals included, but they are\\nconfusingly laid out and nonsensical. The story also isn't coherent at all,\\nand doesn't seem to follow any kind of plot. However, what if we train for\\nmore epochs at this rank?\\n\\n10 epochs, learning rate 3e-4, rank 512:\\n\\n> It was in the spring. We all know that time period has its charm; the cherry\\n> blossoms are blooming. It's nice because they are also pretty and it's not\\n> too hot yet. You can enjoy them from your room window, but it's also nice to\\n> go to Ueno Park. The weather is just right for that kind of thing--nice\\n> enough for jackets but warm enough to sit outside. In the evening it gets\\n> colder and you want something warm to drink. So I'll tell you about an old\\n> fashioned coffee house I went to. They still have these places. I think\\n> they're more popular in Europe than here, actually. But in Japan, they are\\n> everywhere! Anyway, it's very retro and very expensive but also quite cozy.\\n> I remember ordering this delicious iced coffee, the flavor is caramel or\\n> chocolate--I don't know exactly what it's called.\\n\\nAt this point, we can see that it still does follow the training text.\\nHowever, both the impact that the style has, as well as the coherence problems\\nare attenuated. You'll notice that when the epochs increased, it lost a lot of\\nthe \\\"literary\\\" feel that the higher ranks had, but it also turned out to be\\neasier to follow.\\n\\nLeaving the number of epochs the same, but lowering the learning rate had a\\nsimilar effect:\\n\\n3 epochs, learning rate 3e-6, rank 512:\\n\\n> One day while I was playing my Nintendo, a beautiful little girl came into\\n> the room. She had dark hair and glowing green eyes. \\\"What are you doing?\\\"\\n> She asked me with a wide smile on her face. I couldn't help but stare at\\n> her, captivated by her innocent and charming demeanor. As she played along\\n> with me, I became more intrigued by her unique beauty.\\n\\n> After an hour or two passed by, I felt myself becoming enchanted by her\\n> presence even more.

It's much less literary and more\\nconversational again in the same manner.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAs you can see, changing the rank is the largest adjustment you can make on\\nhow strong a LoRA is at altering the text. Think of the rank as volume, and\\nthe learning rate and epoch count as gain and equalizers to adjust the impact\\nof the rank. Having too low of a rank, or too high of an epoch count or learn\\nrate will mean that you may not notice much, if any, affect on the output. So\\nfirst, crank up the rank to get yourself in the ballpark, and then adjust the\\nepoch and learning rate as finer adjustments to get closer to where you need\\nto be. Every model and dataset combination is different, so there's going to\\nbe a huge case of YMMV - but using this technique will get to where you want\\nto be in the most efficient manner.\\n\\n## Subscribe to our newsletter.\\n\\nEnter your email\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n## Unleash Your Imagination: Generate Uncensored & Unrestricted NSFW Images on\\nRunPod\\n\\nToday, we're not just pushing the envelope\\u2014we're tearing it open.

Dedicated followers\\nand irate haters dominate the extremes. In the middle lie profiles like Hazme\\nuna foto as\\u00ed (Take a photo of me like this), an Instagram account born during\\nthe pandemic with the aim of parodying the most-followed influencers in Spain.\\nWhat started as entertainment has today turned into an account with nearly\\n300,000 followers. The paradox is that now Lorena Mac\\u00edas, its founder, is also\\na content creator.\\n\\nHowever, her posts do not share tricks to make money by investing in\\ncryptocurrencies, nor do they reveal the umpteenth garment purchased at Zara.\\nHer posts echo the blunders made by influencers (almost always alluding to\\nfemale figures) and the brazenness and lack of ethics many accounts display\\nwhen advertising products. \\u201cI started uploading memes to pass the time and\\nsuddenly they started to go viral. At the beginning it was spontaneous and\\nunpretentious, but naturally, having always worked in advertising, when I saw\\nthat the account was gathering a good group of people, I tried to pull the\\nright levers to make it grow\\u201d, says Mac\\u00edas, an advertising creative by\\nprofession.\\n\\n### Humor as a tool for criticism\\n\\nHumorously, but without taking it entirely as a joke, Mac\\u00edas highlights the\\nlack of scruples on the part of those who take advantage of almost nonexistent\\nlegislation on content creation to profit by recommending articles without\\nissuing a warning that it is advertising. Or those who resell a product on\\nsecond-hand platforms moments after having told their audience how much they\\nlike it. The account\\u2019s followers are, in many cases, regular users of social\\nnetworks and knowledgeable about the influencers that inhabit them; others are\\nalien to this microcosm of unbridled consumerism. All of them, though, connect\\nwith the narrative of Hazme una foto as\\u00ed, and its balance between humor,\\ncriticism and reflection. \\u201cI think people connect because they\\u2019re fed up with\\nposturing, with Instagram\\u2019s impostor perfection and, above all, with being\\nlied to. And also because I try to do it through humor, which is a universal\\nand very powerful resource that doesn\\u2019t need great context. In fact, the\\nmessage I get the most is: \\u2018I don\\u2019t know any of the influencers you\\u2019re talking\\nabout, but I\\u2019m pissing myself laughing at how you present it,\\u2019\\u201d Mac\\u00edas tells\\nEL PA\\u00cdS.\\n\\nGlobally, the forerunner that inspired many of these parody accounts is\\nInfluencers in the Wild, one of the first profiles to point out the absurdity\\nthat sometimes surrounds social media. Created by George Resch (known on the\\ninternet as Tank Sinatra) to lift the lid on the lengths to which some content\\ncreators go to get the dream photo, it brings together more than five million\\nloyal followers. By decontextualizing the publications and revealing the\\nreality behind the apparent perfection and spontaneity that many influencers\\nseek to sell, it becomes clear that naturalness is conspicuous by its absence.\\n\\nHow are these criticisms and parodies received from the other side of the\\ncoin? In the opinion of Sergio Barreda, CEO of the influencer agency Keepers,\\n\\u201cthe beauty of the networks is the plurality they offer and, therefore, there\\nhas to be room for these types of profiles that base their content more on\\nsatire or irony, which has always been present in humor; but, as in comedy,\\nthe key is always to do it from a humorous point of view and not by resorting\\nto easy criticism.\\u201d\\n\\nHumor is also the hallmark of Models with Sciatica, an account created by\\nLaura C. \\u2014 she prefers not to give her last name \\u2014 in July 2020, in which she\\nplaces the spotlight on the hyper-sexualization of women in the fashion\\nindustry. She says that the profile \\u201cgrew in a totally crazy way in less than\\n24 hours.\\u201d Her feed is made up of images from campaigns or editorials where\\nmodels appear in impossible poses. The fun is in the text that accompanies\\neach photograph: brief, accurate and sarcastic. The formula is not very new,\\nbut it came at the right time. With little expectation, her first post\\ngarnered \\u201cmore than 500 followers in half an hour. In 24 hours, there were\\nmore than 20,000. It was crazy,\\u201d says Laura in conversation with this\\nnewspaper. Since then, her community has exceeded 32,000 followers.\\n\\nWhen asked about the potential for controversy as a result of her\\npublications, she says that \\u201cby not focusing on anyone\\u201d in particular, she has\\nnot made any enemies, although \\u201cthere has been someone who has come in to\\nargue for the sake of arguing, and I don\\u2019t waste much time there.\\u201d Mac\\u00edas, who\\nhas been blocked on Instagram by some of the content creators she has alluded\\nto in her publications, cannot say the same. However, anger is the exception:\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not the same for me to parody a gaffe or a memeable pose as it is for me\\nto publicly point out that you are reselling the products that a brand sent\\nyou yesterday, because that speaks of your professionalism and your ethics.\\nAnd that, naturally, doesn\\u2019t sit well with anyone,\\u201d says Mac\\u00edas, who as a\\nresult of the success of the profile has set up her own advertising agency and\\na podcast to address issues related to the sector from a more serious\\nperspective.\\n\\n### An industry under construction\\n\\nIn Barreda\\u2019s experience, not all influencers react the same way to criticism.\\n\\u201cFashion and lifestyle profiles are the ones that are attacked or criticized\\nthe most, and, therefore, I think they have the worst time with these types of\\nmessages,\\u201d he says. \\u201cHumor or entertainment profiles take criticism in a\\ndifferent way, less personally.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite its growing visibility, the public calling out of Hazme una foto as\\u00ed\\nhas not had too many consequences. \\u201cIn some cases, brands have contacted me\\nprivately to inform me that they have terminated the contract with an\\ninfluencer as a result of a flagrant catch, but these are very specific\\ncases,\\u201d says its founder. \\u201cThe most significant consequence is that the people\\nwho follow me are able to identify these unethical practices, which previously\\nwent unnoticed.\\u201d In this sense, Barreda says these kinds of profiles can help\\nprofessionals in the sector to identify bad practices: \\u201cWe must acknowledge\\nthat some of these messages and publications sometimes help us to improve and\\ndetect profiles that are not doing well, or campaigns that are not well\\nexecuted and, therefore, make us keep a close eye on our own. Even so, as in\\neverything, there are profiles that I like and others that I think cross the\\nline.

Until now I have usually responded by handing around Blickensderfer\\ntypewheels or Hammond typeshuttles, in an effort to make the point that there\\nwas nothing really new in the golfball \\u2013 it was \\u201cvery old typewriter\\ntechnology\\u201d.\\n\\nBlickensderfer typewheel\\n\\nYet many people today do, oddly enough, identify typewriters in general with\\nthe golfball. It\\u2019s almost as if it seems, to some, that the story of the\\ntypewriter began and ended with the golfball. And in some ways, that\\u2019s\\nactually quite true.\\n\\nBut not the way IBM tells it. According to that mighty conglomerate, \\u201cfor the\\nfirst 90 years of typewriter technology, typebars proved to be the only\\nefficient way to make an impression on a page\\u201d. Try telling that to James\\nBartlett Hammond and George Canfield Blickensderfer, if you dare!\\n\\nHammond typeshuttle\\n\\nIBM goes on, \\u201cIn 1961, IBM introduced a revolutionary way to make a typewriter\\nwork, and work well. This was the IBM Selectric typewriter, which replaced\\ntypebars and moving carriages with a printing element, a sphere no larger than\\na golfball, which bears all alphabet characters, numbers and punctuation\\nsymbols.\\u201d\\n\\nWow! Revolutionary? \\u201cA sphere no larger than a golfball, which bears all\\nalphabet characters, numbers and punctuation symbols\\u201d Um, didn\\u2019t Robert Thomas\\ndo that in 1854? And John Pratt in 1866? And James Hammond in 1881? And Lucien\\nStephen Crandall later that same year? And Charles Spiro (below) in 1885? And\\nGeorge Blickensderfer in 1893? And Charles Bennett on a pocket typewriter in\\n1907?\\n\\nCrandall typesleeve\\n\\nBut wait, there\\u2019s more: \\u201cThe IBM Selectric typewriter, the machine that\\nswitched typeface styles by changing its golfball ... quite simply\\nrevolutionised the way in which the world typed. By using various Selectric\\ntyping elements, a user could type away in Hebrew (done many years before on\\nmanual portable typewriters) or in modern Greek (done years before), or in\\nJapanese phonetic Katakana (done years before).\\u201d\\n\\nCome on, IBM, tell us what really was so new about the Selectric! An electric\\ntypewriter with a typewheel? Blickensderfer did that in 1902, almost six\\ndecades before the Selectric.\\n\\nWell, OK, in terms of the \\u201cend\\u201d of typewriters, IBM\\u2019s introduction of the\\nSelectric a little more than half a century ago, on July 31, 1961 - almost\\nexactly 87 years from the day the Sholes and Glidden first went on sale -\\nprobably did spell the beginning of the end of production of the manual\\ntypewriters that we all know and love.\\n\\nIn that regard, it's not surprising some people today see the Selectric as the\\nbe all and end all of typewriters.\\n\\nMany seem to have been brainwashed by the bombardment of 1960s IBM propaganda,\\nits heavy duty promotion and advertising for the Selectric, the so-called\\n\\u201cCadillac of typewriters\\u201d. Indeed, the US Postal Service featured the\\nSelectric in a \\u201cPioneers of American Industrial Design\\u201d stamp series.\\n\\nBut as for the \\u201cbeginning\\u201d of typewriters, regardless of what IBM might say\\nnow, the IBM golfball\\u2019s true genesis is officially recorded as dating back to\\nJohn Jonathan Pratt, inventor of the 1866 \\u201cPterotype\\u201d (\\u201cwinged type\\u201d).\\n\\nPratt (above) patented his machine in the US on yesterday\\u2019s date, August 11,\\nin 1868, describing it as a \\u201cmechanical typographer\\u201d. Some historians regard\\nthe Pterotype as the first practical typewriter ever produced, predating the\\nSholes and Glidden by as many as five years. See\\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/06/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\\nxxxii.html\\n\\nIn its history of the creation of the golfballed Selectric, IBM passingly\\nacknowledges the influence of the truly revolutionary Blickensderfer, the\\nclassic styling lines of Olivetti (see\\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/05/100-years-of-olivetti-\\ntypewriters_04.html) and its need to buy the design patent for Louis Marx\\u2019s\\n1940s toy typewriter.\\n\\nThe Marx toy typewriter in question, by the way, was designed by Ray Lohr, who\\nwas educated Xavier University in Cincinnati, where noted typewriter collector\\nand historian Richard Polt, one of oztypewriter\\u2019s best friends, is now\\nprofessor of philosophy.\\n\\nIBM even overlooks the efforts of one of its own finest servants, the\\nbrilliant and uber prolific Frederick Merchant Carroll. As the Selectric was\\nbeing developed by much younger men in Poughkeepsie, a little further north-\\nwest in New York, at IBM\\u2019s laboratory in Binghamton, the then 86-year-old\\nCarroll was working on a \\u201cmoveable drum typewriter\\u201d, using a much more\\nconventional typewheel on an IBM electric typewriter. Carroll\\u2019s design (below)\\nwas patented on this day in 1958, when he was 89.\\n\\nCarroll died on October 30, 1960, aged 91. The Selectric was still nine months\\naway from the marketplace. In the excitement of that final period of a 15-year\\ndevelopment program to produce the Selectric, Carroll\\u2019s input, the last\\nripening of fruit from 64 years of inventing, was sadly forgotten.\\n\\nOther than its slight nod to the Blick, Olivetti and Marx, IBM keeps the\\nbackground information on the Selectric \\u201cin-house\\u201d, in Poughkeepsie,\\nmentioning the IBM design and mechanical engineers involved but ignoring the\\noriginal ideas that flowed into the Selectric from such legendary great\\ntypewriter inventors as John Pratt and Charles Spiro.\\n\\nIBM\\u2019s official history has the genesis of the golfball dating from 1946. IBM\\nsays: \\u201cThe pedigree for the golfball element goes back to 1946 and an\\numbrella-shaped development model in Poughkeepsie, New York, called a\\n\\u2018mushroom printer\\u2019.\\u201d But that is only partially true. The people who actually\\npatented the golfball itself, on July 21, 1959, referenced a design Pratt had\\nassigned to James Bartlett Hammond on June 21, 1892 (below).\\n\\nPratt had, of course, used a typewheel in his Pterotype and sold the rights to\\nit to Hammond in 1878. Ensuing legal action by Hammond against Lucien Stephen\\nCrandall forced Crandall to adapt the typewheel into an elongated typesleeve,\\ncoming up with something typewriter historian Michael Adler links to Robert\\nThomas\\u2019s 1854 Typograph (below). See\\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/07/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\\nli.html\\n\\nThe \\u201cinventors\\u201d of the golfball were John E. Hickerson, Ralph E. Page and\\nJames A. Weldenhammer, working for IBM in Poughkeepsie. They had applied for\\nthe patent on November 17, 1955 (below). IBM workers initially referred to it\\nas the \\u201cflying walnut\\u201d, or \\u201cbouncing ball\\u201d.\\n\\nApart from Pratt\\u2019s design for the Hammond, this team also referenced a\\ntypewheel typewriter designed by George H. Treadgold (1859-1925), of Port\\nHuron, Michigan, in 1898, and a typographic machine designed in 1902 by the\\nfamous Hartford, Connecticut, inventor Francis Henry Richards (born 1850)\\nwhich Richards had assigned to the American Typographic Corporation of New\\nJersey.\\n\\nRichards\\n\\nThat\\u2019s another part of the real heritage of the Selectric, at least as far as\\nthis particular style of single type element is concerned. The technology of\\nhow to operate it is an entirely different story. IBM largely gives the credit\\nfor this to Horace Smart \\\"Bud\\\" Beattie (1909-1993).\\n\\nAccording to a 1961 advertisement for the Selectric, Beattie's Ploughkeepsie\\nteam \\u201cbegan their search by forgetting the past 50 years of typewriter\\ndesign\\u201d. Judging by its patent references, however, that is a very long way\\nfrom the truth! Or maybe it forgot the immediately preceding 50 years, then\\nremembered the previous 50 years, going back to the 1850s? Under Beattie\\u2019s\\ndirection, Hickerson \\\"revised the typehead toward its ultimate spherical\\nconfiguration\\\". Beattie (above), who was to become vice-president of\\nengineering in the office products division of IBM, graduated from the\\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He started with IBM in June 1933,\\nworking under Carroll, and retired after more than 40 years. Beattie worked\\nsubsequently as a consultant. He received the American Society of Mechanical\\nEngineers Medal in 1971 and the Engineering Citation of the Society of\\nManufacturing Engineers in 1973. He was elected to the National Academy of\\nEngineering in 1976.\\n\\nDescribed as \\u201cthe proverbial engineer's engineer [and] well ahead of his\\ntime\\u201d, Beattie was IBM\\u2019s lab director at its new Electric Typewriter Division\\nin Lexington, Kentucky, in 1957. There he completed what IBM president Thomas\\nJohn Watson (below) called \\\"the most totally distinct invention we've ever\\nmade as a company\\\" \\u2014 the single-element printer. \\\"This,\\\" Watson said, \\\"is the\\nmost significant change in typing in 120 years.\\\"\\n\\nThe Selectric was said to have been \\u201cthe basis for countless printers and led\\nto IBM's memory typewriters and correcting typewriters. In a 1986 article on\\noffice communications, USA Today said Beattie \\u2018changed the office landscape\\nforever\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\nWatson rated Beattie one of the three best design engineers and inventors ever\\nto work for IBM. I wonder if Carroll was another? Beattie recalled later the\\nmoment Watson first saw the golfball operate: \\u201cWe were in the old Kenyon House\\nin Poughkeepsie. [Watson] came in and asked me what I was doing. I said, \\u2018I\\u2019ve\\ngot something I\\u2019d like to show you.\\u2019 We went down into the bowels of that old\\nmansion, to the little room where John Hickerson was tinkering with the\\nmushroom [typehead] ... John turned it on, and it started to bob and wobble\\naround. Mr Watson sat there mesmerised. Then he broke out laughing and said,\\n\\u2018Bud, you must have been drunk when you designed that thing!\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nWhat Watson saw in 1954 was the operation of a development of the \\u201cmushroom\\nprinter\\u201d (above) to which the IBM history refers - the \\u201cumbrella-shaped\\ndevelopment model in Poughkeepsie\\u201d. IBM says, \\u201cThe intent had been to use it\\nas a printer on an IBM accounting machine. Earlier versions did see some\\naction with the IBM Stretch computer [before being applied to the Selectric\\ntypewriter].\\u201d\\n\\nHere\\u2019s where things get interesting. Beattie had applied for a patent for this\\ndevice, calling it a \\u201chigh speed printing mechanism\\u201d, on February 17, 1948,\\nand the patent was issued on December 8, 1953.\\n\\nIn filing his application, Beattie referred to many earlier inventions,\\nstarting with some astonishing typewriter designs from a Charles Hire Perry\\n(born Vermont, June 25, 1844), a doctor in Oneida, New York. The designs\\n(above) date from 1887, and Perry had assigned them to Thomas Redfield Proctor\\n(1844-1920, below), a wealthy Utica, New York, banker and businessman who\\nbacked Perry\\u2019s enterprises.\\n\\nCompare the Beattie and Perry configurations:\\n\\nBeattie (left) Perry (right)\\n\\nOther earlier typewriter designs to which Beattie referred were by the noted\\nFreeport, Illinois, inventor, manufacturer and banker Daniel Carroll Stover\\n(1839-1908, below) and London-based Scottish politician James Dundas White\\n(1866-1951), as well as another quite remarkable machine, this one from\\nLithuanian-born Saul Aronson of New York.\\n\\nStover\\u2019s designs date from 1888 (IBM failed to cite Stover's original\\n\\\"mushroom\\\" patent, below), White\\u2019s date from 1902 and Aronson\\u2019s from 1907.\\n\\nStover 1888\\n\\nStover's second patent, 1891\\n\\nAronson\\n\\nPut aside the claims that Beattie got the idea of the mushroom-shaped type\\nelement from changing a light bulb at home. The Perry, Stover and Aronson\\nmachines all used convex type elements, giving Beattie the basis for his\\n\\u201cmushroom\\u201d printer. In fact, they are all almost identical to Beattie\\u2019s\\ndesign.\\n\\nAdler in Antique Typewriters (1997) called the Perry design (above)\\n\\u201cinteresting\\u201d and said the idea was \\u201can index of lenticular section comparable\\nto the Lambert but manipulated by means of vertical joy-stick\\u201d. Adler said of\\nWhite (who he mistakenly called \\u201cJ.G.Whyte\\u201d) \\u201cA machine which typed around a\\nvertical platen riding up on a spiral groove\\u201d.\\n\\nBefore Hickerson was issued with a patent for a \\u201ckey-operated machine\\u201d [the\\nSelectric, sans an inking component] on April 4, 1961 (above), Hickerson and\\nPage had been part of a team headed by Leon E. Palmer which patented a \\u201csingle\\nelement printing machine\\u201d on March 31, 1959 (below).\\n\\nThis shows clear evidence of the way in which the golfball \\u201cwobbled\\u201d on its\\nstem. Because the Selectric\\u2019s platen remained stationary, the type element\\u2019s\\nface needed to be curved so that all three lines of type could strike the\\nplaten squarely. A straight-edged typewheel could not have achieved this\\nwithout the platen moving up and down to accommodate each line.\\n\\nIt is in these areas that the Lohr-Marx patent (above) came into play. It was\\nvery much still in force at the time the Palmer team\\u2019s patent was applied for\\non November 17, 1955. At that time, Palmer and Co referenced an unusual 1931\\ntypewheel typewriter designed by Gustave Teissedre of Strasbourg-Alsace in\\nFrance and first patented in Germany (below). The typewheel was rotated by a\\ncurved arm.\\n\\nPalmer and Co also referenced a typewriter (below) designed by Charles A.\\nFuchs for the Burnell Laboratory Company of Locust Valley, New York, in 1935.\\nThis used as typewheel on a pivoted arm.\\n\\nThe Palmer team\\u2019s patent has a rounded type element inked by adjoining ribbon\\nspools. This method was used, for example, on the Teletype Model 26 (see\\nbelow).\\n\\nPalmer developed the character-selection system for the Selectric. IBM says,\\n\\\"This system provided for fixed units of motion controlled by mathematical\\nratios. Palmer was made an IBM Fellow \\u2014 the highest honor IBM bestows on a\\nscientist, engineer or programmer, and an elite group handpicked by the CEO \\u2014\\nfor his contributions to the Selectric. He holds the majority of the patents\\nthat resulted from the development of the original machine.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, \\u201cback at the ranch\\u201d, as they say in the classics: While Beattie and\\nhis team in Poughkeepsie were working on their \\u201cmushroom printer\\u201d, in\\nBinghamton, one of IBM\\u2019s oldest and most gifted hands was coming up with one\\nlast, magnificent design.\\n\\nFor Frederick Merchant Carroll (above), this \\u201cmovable drum typewriter\\u201d would\\nbe a parting gesture for the company he had served so well, and so profitably,\\nfor 41 years. Carroll\\u2019s patent, for which he had made an application on\\nJanuary 5, 1955, was aimed in the same direction as Beattie\\u2019s single type\\nelement printing, except it was for a typewriter \\u2013 and he was using a three-\\nline typewheel, identical to those used on Blicks and Bennetts.\\n\\nCarroll wrote in his application that his typewriter would have \\u201ctype\\ncharacters .. arranged on a drum or other printing member which is moved under\\ncontrol of selector elements, such as type keys ...\\u201d Bear in the mind that at\\nthis time, the Poughkeepsie team was headed toward an accounting machine or\\nthe massive Stretch computer, not a typebar typewriter. Also, Carroll was\\nusing a typewheel (or typeball) that rotated and pivoted. For his references\\nin his design, Carroll pointed way back, to Charles Spiro\\u2019s 1885 typewheel\\ntypewriter (below).\\n\\nDuring a career spanning 61 years, Carroll took out 97 patents. These included\\nan IBM typewriter in 1943. He was still being issued with patents a year after\\nhis death. Carroll was born in Union City, Ohio, in 1869, the son of an\\ninventor (David Carroll), and he started taking out his own patents in 1896.\\nHis first was for a cyclometer.\\n\\nAt the turn of the century, Carroll moved to New Haven, Connecticut, were he\\nworked on adding machines and calculators, then to Dayton, Ohio, to work for\\nthe National Cash Register Company. In 1916 he joined the Tabulating Machine\\nCompany, one of the organisations which later emerged into IBM, at the Product\\nDevelopment Laboratory in Endicott, New York. He subsequently worked in\\nYorkers then Binghamton. During his time at IBM, Carroll developed rotary type\\npresses, an automatic high-speed rotary card manufacturing machine, the\\nautomatic ledger posting \\u201ccompensating\\u201d carriage, a \\\"unit counter\\\", a small\\nelectromechanical device that acted as a single adding wheel, and other\\naccounting machines. He introduced a photoelectric sensing apparatus. It is\\nsaid that he \\u201chelped to revolutionise the entire business machines industry\\u201d.\\n\\nAmong the people he had worked closely with at IBM was Eugene Amzi Ford,\\ninventor of the Ford typewriter (above). See\\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/07/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\\nlxvix.html\\n\\nFred M. Carroll, left, Eugene A. Ford, right\\n\\nFinally, we come to the Marx toy typewriter (below), designed in 1939 by\\nRaymond John Lohr of Erie, Pennsylvania (ironically, George Canfield\\nBlickensderfer\\u2019s home town).\\n\\nRobert William Bemer (above), a computer scientist at IBM, recalled, \\u201cOne day\\nduring initial Selectric production at Lexington, Kentucky, the honoured\\ntouring guest was Mr [Louis] Marx, of Marx Toys [see the cover of Time,\\nbelow], grinning ear to ear. The reason? IBM had purchased the rights to his\\ntoy typewriter for children as a large basis for their [Selectric] design.\\u201d\\n\\nLohr\\u2019s design is for an enlarged version of the well-known Junior toy\\ntypewriter, the patent for which had been held in Germany. But bear this in\\nmind: Marx did not own the patent for the more familiar \\u201cstemmed\\u201d Marx toy\\ntypewriter, which it produced under licence from Samuel I. Berger of Newark\\n(apparently Marx and Berger \\u201cswapped\\u201d a lot of designs in the 1930s). The\\npatent on the Berger typewriter had expired in 1949, anyway, while the Lohr\\npatent was still very much in force in 1957, at a time when development of the\\nSelectric was in full flow.\\n\\nLohr, who also designed the Big Wheel and Rockem-Sockem Robots for Marx, was\\nborn in Cincinnati in 1912. At 23, he was hired as a mechanical designer by\\nLouis Marx and Company Toys in Erie, retiring after a 37-year career in 1972\\nas chief toy designer in 1972. He died in Erie on October 3, 2005, aged 93.\\n\\nThe Selectric\\u2019s body was the work of influential American designer Eliot Fette\\nNoyes (1910-1977), of New Canaan, Connecticut (below).\\n\\nBoston-born Noyes created a number of design projects for IBM. He studied\\narchitecture at Harvard (1932-1938) and worked as a curator at the Museum of\\nModern Art and as director of industrial design. After World War II, Noyes was\\ndesign director with Norman Bel Geddes, for whom Royal typewriter designer\\nHenry Dreyfuss had served his apprenticeship in the early 1920s. When Bel\\nGeddes' office closed in 1947, one of the unfinished projects was a Model A\\nelectric typewriter for IBM. Noyes opened his own office and finished the job\\nfor IBM. He was retained in 1948 by Thomas Watson for IBM product design and\\nin 1956 developed a unique IBM corporate style and image similar to Olivetti.\\nHe did so with help from Paul Rand, Marcel Breuer and Charles Eames.\\n\\nIn his design for the Selectric, Noyes referenced earlier IBM machines and the\\nwork of Frederic S. Grover, Theodore G. Clement and Carl W. Sundberg. Notably,\\nhowever, he also referred to Laird Fortune Covey\\u2019s FP design for Royal. See\\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/06/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\\nxxxvi.html Selectrics and their descendants eventually captured 75 per cent of\\nthe United States market for electric typewriters used in business. It is\\nestimated 13 million were sold worldwide up to 2002 (though production\\nofficially ended in 1987). The Selectric was succeeded by the Wheelwriter in\\n1984 and IBM transferred its typewriter business to the newly formed Lexmark\\nin 1991.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the IBM Selectric was first and foremost a team effort,\\ninvolving not just Beattie but Hickerson, Palmer and many other IBM design,\\nmechanical and electronic engineers. But there was very little, if anything,\\nin its make-up that was entirely unique. Its genes go back to Robert Thomas,\\nJohn Pratt and James Hammond \\u2013 in other words, more than 100 years before the\\nSelectric was actually made.\\n\\nPosted by Robert Messenger at 16:18\\n\\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\\n\\n#### 9 comments:\\n\\nRichard P said...\\n\\n    \\n\\nOne of your most impressive research articles so far!

Might have to start saving up\\nsomething apart from words for that, though. Yes, it is interesting about the\\nmanual IBM. Apparently Bemer wanted to expand the golfball, with ASCI in mind,\\nbut IBM told him the Selectric would only ever be a \\\"correspondence\\\" machine!\\nIBM was actually taken by surprise by its immediate sales success, though it\\ndoesn't like to admit that now!\\n\\n    15 August 2011 at 09:32\\n\\nUnknown said...\\n\\n    \\n\\nThere's a few reasons why IBM continued selling typebar machines after the\\ndebut of the Selectric.\\n\\n1\\\\. Price - a Model C with a 13\\\" carriage cost $460 in 1962, a Selectric 723\\n(13\\\" platen, 11\\\" writing line) cost $475, and a 725 (15\\\" platen, 13\\\" writing\\nline) cost $495. Fast forward to the Model D (with 12.5\\\" carriage)'s debut in\\n1967, at $490, and the 723 was $500, 725 was $520. And, in 1969, it was $510\\nfor the D, $520 for the 723, and $540 for the 725.\\n\\n2\\\\. Speed - While the Selectric is faster for ordinary typists that aren't\\ntrained in how to run a typebar typewriter properly (myself included), a fast\\ntypist can get a burst of speed that out-types a Selectric. 15.5 characters\\nper second is the most a Selectric can do - that means that if it takes you\\nless than 64.5 ms for a character (or, the other way, if you burst at over 186\\nwpm), you're out-typing the machine. (If you do a 2-character burst and then\\nslow after that, it's no problem, the machine can absorb that in the\\ninterposer system, but a *3*-character burst - that is, selecting the third\\ncharacter less than 129 ms after selecting the first character - and now\\nyou're slowed down by the machine.) Experienced typebar typists could keep the\\ncadence such that multiple typebars were in flight but not colliding, and\\nworld records were set on IBM typebar machines (but never the Selectric\\nAFAIK). IBM didn't want to lose that market.\\n\\n3\\\\. Executive - while the Selectric was IBM's \\\"flagship\\\", it was also a mid-\\nrange machine (although the cheapest machine they sold, from the day the\\nSelectric debuted, was the Selectric 721/711). The bottom of the line was\\nshared by the 11\\\" platen Selectrics and the typebar machines, and the top of\\nthe line was exclusively the domain of the proportional spacing Executive\\ntypebar machines. The typebar machines didn't go away until IBM came up with a\\nproportional spacing Selectric that was suitable for office use (the Mag Card\\nExecutive).\\n\\n    14 October 2012 at 05:06\\n\\nUnknown said...\\n\\n    \\n\\nAnd, of course, I post that before checking...\\n\\nThe CURRENT world record typing speed (over 1 minute in this case) is 216 wpm.\\n\\nSet by Stella Pajunas, in 1946... on an IBM electric. That thing was being\\ndriven harder than a Selectric's theoretical max.\\n\\n    14 October 2012 at 05:13\\n\\nquadibloc said...\\n\\n    \\n\\nI have used a VariTyper, and so I know that typing on it is slow compared to\\ntyping on a conventional manual typewriter, and the keys require considerably\\nmore force to press. So, although I have no direct experience with the\\nBlickensderfer, I would dare to tell Mr. Hammond, at least, that the Selectric\\ndid bring something new to the table, even if it certainly was not the very\\nidea of a single element typewriter.\\n\\n    15 October 2016 at 13:23\\n\\nMarcin said...\\n\\n    \\n\\nI have not much to add, except: what a fantastic article this is.\\n\\n    4 May 2017 at 02:30\\n\\nquadibloc said...\\n\\n    \\n\\nCome to think of it, though, the statement by IBM did contain an error.

It is lightweight and contains the\\nlatest stable versions of software. Packages are in .tar.gz format and are\\ntracked by a package manager that is designed to allow easy package upgrades.\\nArch is quite streamlined compared to some other distributions. Things that\\nare relatively unused (by me, anyway) are not kept (info-pages, for example).\\nA default Arch install leaves you with a solid base; from there, you can add\\npackages to create the custom installation you're looking for. Arch has a\\npackage build system that allows you to easily create your own packages, which\\nmakes it very easy to rebuild a package with your own custom configuration.\\nArch also aims to use the newer features available to linux users, such as\\nreiserfs/ext3 and devfs.\\n\\nComponents\\n\\nAll components are optional, of course. It's your system -- build it however\\nyou want.\\n\\n  * Linux Kernel 2.4.18\\n  * XFree86 4.2.0\\n  * glibc 2.2.5\\n  * gcc 2.95.3\\n  * OpenSSH 3.1p1\\n  * Mozilla 0.9.9\\n  * WindowMaker 0.80.0\\n  * Vim 6.1\\n  * Reiserfsprogs 3.x.1b\\n  * devfsd 1.3.22\\n  * ... and more ...\\n\\nMailing List\\n\\nThere is a mailing list in place for general discussion about Arch Linux.\\nHere, you can post questions, problems, solutions, ideas, etc. To subscribe to\\nthe list, send an email to arch-request@archlinux.org with subscribe as the\\nsubject.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can click here to use the web interface.\\n\\nIRC\\n\\nThe project is still in its early stages of development.

Were the Anglo-Saxon kings recycling old Roman scrap metal? Or had they\\nfound lucrative sources from mines in Europe?\\n\\nMetallurgical analysis of early medieval coins has revealed the answer: the\\npower brokers of the time were melting down their stockpiles of Byzantine\\nsilver treasures, in a type of early medieval quantitative easing that\\nkickstarted the economy of England and established a monetary system that\\nwould last for a millennium.\\n\\nChemical analysis of coins from the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has\\nrevealed two distinct phases of the silver rush. For almost a century from the\\n660s, coins were minted from silver bullion that originated in the Byzantine\\nempire on the eastern Mediterranean. Then, after stocks of those treasures\\nwere drying up in about 750, silver from a mine in western France came to\\npredominate across Europe, during the reign of Charlemagne.\\n\\nA selection of the Fitzwilliam Museum coins that were studied. Photograph: The\\nFitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge\\n\\n\\u201cThis was such an exciting discovery,\\u201d said Rory Naismith, a professor of\\nearly medieval English history at the University of Cambridge, one of the\\nacademics behind the study. \\u201cNow we have the first archaeometric confirmation\\nthat Byzantine silver was the dominant source behind the great seventh-century\\nsurge in minting and trade around the North Sea.\\u201d\\n\\nThe coins that were minted were silver pennies \\u2013 each perhaps equivalent to\\n\\u00a320-\\u00a330 today \\u2013 which formed \\u201cthe bedrock of the English economy\\u201d until at\\nleast the 16th century, Naismith said.\\n\\nIntriguingly, the isotopic signature of the Byzantine silver showed it was\\nalready decades or more old \\u2013 most likely it had been prized as a way to\\ndisplay its owner\\u2019s power and wealth. The ruler honoured at Sutton Hoo,\\nthought to be Raedwald of East Anglia, was buried with a collection of\\nByzantine silver bowls and other items which, if melted down, could have made\\n10,000 pennies, the authors say.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s fair to say we were surprised by this result,\\u201d said Dr Jane Kershaw, an\\nassociate professor at Oxford University\\u2019s school of archaeology and the\\nstudy\\u2019s lead author. \\u201cWe know of some surviving Byzantine silver from Anglo-\\nSaxon England, most famously from Sutton Hoo, but far greater amounts of\\nByzantine silver must have originally been held in Anglo-Saxon stores.\\u201d\\n\\nShe added: \\u201cThis was quantitative easing \\u2013 elites were liquidating silver\\nstored in valuable objects and using that silver to make coins that then\\ncirculated widely. It would have had a big impact on people\\u2019s lives. Far more\\npeople than before would have used coined money and thought in terms of\\nmonetary values.\\u201d\\n\\nNot only rulers but also powerful monasteries minted their own coins, said\\nNaismith. \\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t a Bank of England at this stage \\u2013 if you want some\\ncoins, you make some coins. You just need to be someone who\\u2019s got the wealth\\nto do it.\\u201d\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion\\n\\nSign up to First Edition\\n\\nFree daily newsletter\\n\\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\\u2019s\\nhappening and why it matters\\n\\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\\ncontent funded by outside parties.

It shows that if people in\\nEngland wanted to have a complex economy with currency, they couldn\\u2019t just\\nrely on the resources at home \\u2013 they needed to deal with people in the\\nMediterranean, in France, in all sorts of other places.\\n\\n\\u201cIt shows interdependency, and how connections and networks have been\\nfundamental to economic success for hundreds and hundreds of years.\\u201d\\n\\nThe research is published in Antiquity.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n  * Archaeology\\n  * England\\n  * news\\n\\nShare\\n\\nReuse this content\\n\\n## More on this story\\n\\n## More on this story\\n\\n  * ### \\u2018Very rare\\u2019 clay figurine of Mercury discovered at Roman site in Kent\\n\\n23 Feb 2024\\n\\n  * ### \\u2018Forging new history\\u2019: high-end iron age smithy unearthed in Oxfordshire\\n\\n28 Jan 2024\\n\\n  * ### Early medieval Welsh cemetery found containing crouching bodies\\n\\n3 Jan 2024\\n\\n  * ### Cerne Abbas giant is Hercules and was army meeting point, say historians\\n\\n1 Jan 2024\\n\\n  * ### National Trust archaeologists find medieval \\u2018gift token\\u2019 in Norfolk\\n\\n18 Dec 2023\\n\\n  * ### Archaeologists reveal life stories of hundreds of people from medieval Cambridge\\n\\n1 Dec 2023\\n\\n  * ### Coin hoard that could be linked to Glen Coe massacre found under fireplace\\n\\n9 Oct 2023\\n\\n  * ### Stone age Dartmoor viewpoint uncovered by archaeologists\\n\\n30 Aug 2023\\n\\n  * ### \\u2018Hugely exciting and rare\\u2019: Neolithic polishing stone found in Dorset\\n\\n14 Jul 2023\\n\\n## Most viewed\\n\\n## Most viewed\\n\\n  * World\\n  * UK\\n  * Climate crisis\\n  * Ukraine\\n  * Environment\\n  * Science\\n  * Global development\\n  * Football\\n  * Tech\\n  * Business\\n  * Obituaries\\n\\n  * News\\n  * Opinion\\n  * Sport\\n  * Culture\\n  * Lifestyle\\n\\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\\nmorning\\n\\nSign up for our email\\n\\n  * Help\\n  * Complaints & corrections\\n  * SecureDrop\\n  * Work for us\\n  * Privacy policy\\n  * Cookie policy\\n  * Terms & conditions\\n  * Contact us\\n\\n  * All topics\\n  * All writers\\n  * Digital newspaper archive\\n  * Facebook\\n  * YouTube\\n  * Instagram\\n  * LinkedIn\\n  * Twitter\\n  * Newsletters\\n\\n  * Advertise with us\\n  * Search UK jobs\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\n\\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The earthquake disrupted wafer fab operations, impacting supply as\\nMicron, Samsung Electronics, and SK Hynix are among those affected, reports\\nDigiTimes. This situation may lead to sharper price increases than\\nanticipated, as the industry was already aiming for higher prices before the\\nquake, in a bid to recoup losses memory makers incurred in the previous years.\\n\\nMicron ceased offering product quotes for the second quarter, shortly after\\nthe earthquake, with its Korean rivals quickly following suit. Industry\\ninsiders revealed that these leading memory chip manufacturers had already\\ninitiated measures to maintain a rising trend in their product prices before\\nthe April 3 quake. Now, it seems highly probable that the price hikes may be\\nmore pronounced than previously expected.\\n\\nIn the past, memory prices have typically surged following production\\ndisruptions caused by natural calamities or accidents. The latest incident\\ncould provide the vendors with chances to compensate for the losses incurred\\nin 2022 and 2023. Prior to the quake, second-quarter DRAM and NAND flash\\ncontract prices were experiencing slower growth compared to the first quarter.\\nSpecifically, NAND flash prices had risen by 15% - 20% for the second quarter,\\nas opposed to over 20% in the first quarter.\\n\\nFollowing the earthquake, Micron announced that it would evaluate the impacts\\non its local production and supply chain. The company stated that it would\\nthen discuss supply schedules with its customers, hinting at potential changes\\nin supply. Industry sources mentioned that memory fabs typically halt\\nproduction during such strong earthquakes, which affects supply of memory\\nwafers.\\n\\nMemory module manufacturers, who are reportedly low on chip inventory, are now\\npreparing for increased chip purchase costs. They had hoped that the rising\\nprice trends would decelerate, given the rising capacity utilization rates at\\nchip suppliers. However, chip suppliers had significantly reduced production\\nto sustain pricing last year, when demand was stagnant. Downstream customers,\\nincluding server makers, might become aggressive in stocking memory products\\nin anticipation of shortages, further driving up prices.\\n\\nAlthough contract prices might be soaring, the spot market remains weak due to\\nlow demand from the consumer sector following the Lunar New Year. Apparently,\\nthere is still an abundant supply in the spot market, despite the disruptions\\nand anticipated price hikes in the contract market, the report claims.\\n\\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\\n\\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\\ntech news \\u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Nguyen, the FTC\\u2019s Chief Technologist. \\u201cThese exciting solutions show that a\\nmulti-disciplinary approach is necessary to prevent the harms posed by voice\\ncloning.\\u201d\\n\\nThe panel of judges\\u2014Princeton Computer Science Professor Arvind Narayanan,\\nBritt Paris, assistant professor at Rutgers University\\u2019s School of\\nCommunication & Information, and Beau Woods, CEO of Stratigos Security and a\\nCyber Safety Innovation Fellow with the Atlantic Council\\u2014chose three top\\nsubmissions from individuals and small organizations, who will split a total\\nof $35,000 in prize money. They are:\\n\\n  * AI Detect: The submission from David Przygoda and Dr. Carol Espy-Wilson from the small organization OmniSpeech is aimed at consumer and enterprise apps and devices and would use AI to detect AI. It utilizes AI algorithms to distinguish the subtle differences between genuine and synthetic voice patterns.\\n  * DeFake: Submitted by Dr. Ning Zhang, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, this proposal uses a form of watermarking. Given that voice cloning relies on the use of pre-existing speech samples to clone a voice, which are generally collected from social media and other platforms, the proposal calls for adding carefully crafted distortions to voice samples that are imperceptible to the human ear, but that make it more difficult to accurately clone.\\n  * OriginStory: Submitted by Dr. Visar Berisha, Drena Kusari, Dr. Daniel W. Bliss, and Dr. Julie M. Liss of the small organization OriginStory, this technology aims to authenticate the human origin of voice recordings at the point of creation. It uses off-the-shelf sensors already integrated into many devices to simultaneously measure speech acoustics and the co-occurring biosignals in the throat and mouth that a person uses when speaking to validate the human origin and embed this authentication as a type of watermark into the audio stream.\\n\\nThe fourth winning submission is from a large organization, Pindrop Security,\\nwhich received the Recognition Award. The Pindrop team was comprised of Dr.\\nElie Khoury, Anthony Stankus, Ketuman Sardesai, and Amanda Braun. Pindrop\\u2019s\\nVoice Cloning Detection technology detects voice clones and audio deepfakes in\\nreal time. The technology evaluates each incoming phone call or digital audio\\nin two-second chunks and flags those that are potential deep fakes. (Large\\norganizations were not eligible for monetary prizes.)\\n\\nThe four winning submissions demonstrate the potential for cutting edge\\ntechnology to help mitigate risks of voice cloning in the marketplace. They\\npromote innovative approaches on which key consumer protections can be built.\\nAt the same time, the results of the challenge highlight that there is no\\nsingle solution to this problem. Given this, in addition to the Voice Cloning\\nChallenge, the FTC also has proposed a comprehensive ban on impersonation\\nfraud, and has affirmed that the Telemarketing Sales Rule applies to AI-\\nenabled scam calls.\\n\\nThis is the sixth challenge the FTC has launched under the America COMPETES\\nAct aimed at spurring the development of innovative solutions to complex\\nconsumer protection issues. Voice cloning technology offers potential benefits\\nby, for example, providing new ways for those who have impaired speech to\\ncommunicate in their own voice with the help of technology. But it also poses\\nsignificant risks to consumers and has been utilized by scammers to\\nimpersonate others. For example, scammers have used voice cloning technology\\nto impersonate business executives in order to fraudulently obtain money or\\nvaluable information.\\n\\nThe lead FTC staffers on this matter are James Evans and Christine Barker from\\nthe FTC\\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection and Amritha Jayanti and Ben Swartz\\nfrom the FTC\\u2019s Office of Technology.\\n\\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and\\neducate consumers.

Now imagine what\\nit'd be like if that honse were 20 feet tall, and you have only some idea of\\nhow hard it is to relocate the tallest land animal on the planet: a giraffe.\\n\\nTrailering ruminants is on my mind because The Algorithm fed me this video of\\na giraffe being transported upright in a trailer, its head easily 20 feet\\nabove the road. After the initial amusement wore off, curiosity set in. What\\nwas going on? Why was there a giraffe in a trailer? Where were they taking it?\\nAnd is that even safe for the giraffe? Fortunately, the internet has answers,\\nand this mode of transport seems to be very common\\u2014and as imperfect as it\\nlooks.\\n\\n> View this post on Instagram\\n>\\n> A post shared by Matador Network (@matadornetwork)\\n\\nStandards for transporting giraffes appear to vary somewhat by country, but\\nall have one thing in common: The unique trailer. From California to Canada,\\nthe Netherlands, and South Africa, all use heightened trailers with at least\\npartially open roofs to relocate the animals while they're standing up. It's\\nnot as simple as herding the giraffe in and hitting the highway though, as\\nexplained by the Dutch Royal Burgers' Zoo.\\n\\nFor starters, the giraffe has to pass a wellness check, and have a good\\nbehavioral history to be safe to handle. It's also apparently rare to\\ntransport adult giraffes due to their height, with the risk growing alongside\\ntheir lengthy necks. Those same necks complicate loading; you can't sedate a\\ngiraffe, wait until it collapses, and then drag it on to a long trailer and\\nstrap it down like an oversized, organic ATV. Again, their height means just\\ndrugging them can endanger the animal's life if it loses consciousness while\\nstanding\\u2014that head has a long way to fall. (If they are sedated, it's\\ntypically done against an inclined ladder.)\\n\\nSpecialized giraffe trailer. Royal Burgers' Zoo\\n\\nInstead, the Dutch corral one down a narrow hallway directly into a trailer\\nusing a forklift. That trailer will be loaded with hay and water for the\\ngiraffe's comfort, and its roof will be open as soon as the animal is safely\\nin place. From there, it's apparently not much more complicated than driving a\\nhorse trailer around. That is, as long as you remember it's much taller than a\\nhorse.\\n\\nIf you don't, you get what happened in South Africa in 2014. NPR reported on a\\njournalist who witnessed a giraffe in transit strike its head on an overpass,\\nkilling it instantly. It's not clear what happened to the negligent driver,\\nbut it does illustrate that even the best solution here isn't a perfect one.\\nSometimes, there's just no substitute for slowing down and doing things the\\nright way\\u2014especially when you have the life of a majestic, if ungainly\\ncreature in your hands.

The path of this spectacular event stretched from Mazatl\\u00e1n, Mexico to Newfoundland and crossed through 15 US states, providing a treat for an estimated 44 million inhabitants. Those outside the direct path also saw a partial eclipse. While total solar eclipses occur globally every 11-18 months, they seldom intersect with such populated areas. The next major solar eclipse in the US is expected in 2045.\\n  * \\ud83c\\udfdb\\ufe0f Donald Trump, the former US president, has failed in his bid to delay his \\\"hush money\\\" criminal trial, due to begin on 15 April, according to New York appeals court Judge Justice Lizbeth Gonz\\u00e1lez. Trump's lawyers claimed that potential prejudice existed within heavily Democratic Manhattan where the trial is set to be held and they requested an indefinite postponement while seeking a change of venue. The argument was rejected and the hush money trial, the first of four criminal indictments against Trump ready for trial, will proceed as planned. This case will mark the first criminal trial of a former US president.\\n  * \\ud83c\\udf93 US President Joe Biden has proposed a new student loan cancellation scheme, targeting five categories of borrowers who face significant obstacles due to their debt. This revised plan comes after the Supreme Court blocked his original wide-scale debt relief proposal last year. Biden's new offer will provide relief to approximately 30 million people and includes provisions such as cancelling up to $20,000 in interest for certain borrowers and wiping out all debt for people repaying undergraduate loans for over 20 years. However, the scheme might still face legal objections and its implementation depends on the outcome of November's presidential election.\\n  * \\ud83c\\uddea\\ud83c\\udde8 The Ecuadorian President, Daniel Noboa, sparked international outcry after raiding the Mexican embassy to arrest a convicted fugitive. Despite global backlash, Noboa's unorthodox approach is popular among Ecuadorians who seek aggressive policing against escalating crime rates, largely induced by drug cartels. This strategy marked a departure from diplomatic norms; however, local business groups believe this will not disrupt trade talks or commercial relations with Mexico. While Noboa's strong-arm tactics have been domestically praised for tackling crime, its impact on Ecuador's diplomatic relationships remains under scrutiny.\\n  * \\u2696\\ufe0f The US Supreme Court is urged to deny former President Donald Trump's claim of immunity from prosecution regarding his alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Special counsel Jack Smith's team argues that a president's criminal acts potentially threaten democracy and the peaceful transfer of power. Despite lower courts rejecting Mr Trump's claim of immunity, the Supreme Court's upcoming decision could influence whether he faces trial before November's tumultuous elections, as he is currently under scrutiny in four different criminal prosecutions.\\n  * \\ud83d\\udc68\\u2696\\ufe0f Former US President Donald Trump has indicated he won't push for a federal abortion ban despite having altered the Supreme Court\\u2019s stance on Roe v. Wade during his previous term. The decision, enabling each state to control its own abortion laws, has mixed receptions among anti-abortion Christians. Some respect Trump's past achievements in advancing their cause, while others criticise his approach and demand federal restrictions. This development comes as Trump seeks re-election and might influence conservative Christian voters' choice.\\n  * \\ud83c\\udfda\\ufe0fPalestinians in Khan Younis returned to their homes after the Israeli military ended operations in the city, only to find widespread rubble and destruction after an Israeli offensive. Israeli troops had been deployed as part of a response to a Hamas attack. This has led to massive displacement of people towards Rafah, where they face further threat if Israel continues with plans to invade. Meanwhile, negotiators are discussing potential ceasefire deals. The conflict has so far resulted in over 33,000 Palestinian casualties and significant infrastructure damage rendering areas unlivable for the populace.\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nFeedback Post your feedback or question here Thanks for the message.

But in this edition of CIAM Weekly, I'll cover common patterns.\\n\\n###\\n\\nAuthentication Only\\n\\nThe first pattern is when the CIAM system is only responsible for\\nauthentication. Whether using embedded credentials like a password, federation\\nsolutions like SAML or OIDC, or 'what you have' options like magic links, the\\nCIAM product authenticates the user, generates an artifact (often a token)\\nwith the results, and passes it on to the application.\\n\\nThe application then examines the artifact, which contains a user identifier.\\nIn the OIDC world, it's a `sub` claim: https://openid.net/specs/openid-\\nconnect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims , which is immutable and never\\nreassigned.\\n\\nThe application is responsible for mapping the user identifier to whatever\\nauthorization framework it uses and for controlling access to functionality\\nand data based on that.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n\\n  * Each application can use an authorization system or framework that is appropriate to their use case or needs.\\n\\n  * The CIAM system can be easily swapped out if you can find another that offers the same authentication options.\\n\\n  * Authorization logic is business logic and is kept close to application code.\\n\\nChallenges:\\n\\n  * You can get a centralized view of application authentication from the CIAM product, but not a view of the permissions granted in each application.\\n\\n  * You're not taking advantage of a robust generalized permission structure that is typically present in the CIAM system.\\n\\n###\\n\\nEmbedded CIAM Authorization\\n\\nWith this approach, you fully leverage the CIAM system's authZ system. What\\nthat looks like varies based on the CIAM software package, but you can read\\nthe docs for your solution and see what is enabled. A common option is RBAC\\n(role based access control) where you assign users roles and the role or roles\\nare delivered as part of the authentication process.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n\\n  * You can leverage whatever your CIAM system provides, possibly resulting in less custom code.\\n\\n  * You have a centralized view of permissions and they are tied to the user profile.\\n\\nChallenges:\\n\\n  * Whatever authorization solution your CIAM system provides may not be granular enough or otherwise might fall short of your needs.\\n\\n  * Authorization is business logic and may require integration between each application and the CIAM software.\\n\\n###\\n\\nCoarse and Fine Authorization\\n\\nAnother common pattern is to use the CIAM system's authorization for coarse\\ngrained authorization while the application has finer grained controls. If\\nyour CIAM solution supports RBAC, you can assign users to roles such as\\n`admin`, `writer`, `viewer`. The application which receives those roles after\\nthe authentication event can determine what those roles mean in its context.\\n\\nIt can even apply special authorization rules such as 'a writer can write to\\ntheir own projects, but not to any other ones', bringing in more complex and\\nlocal authorization rules.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n\\n  * You have a partial centralized view.\\n\\n  * Applications can come up with any authorization scheme that meets their needs and aren't reliant on a centralized system.\\n\\nChallenges:\\n\\n  * You have a partial centralized view.\\n\\n  * Applications can come up with any authorization scheme that meets their needs and aren't reliant on a centralized system.\\n\\n  * If you have N apps, now you have authorization data in N+1 locations.\\n\\n###\\n\\nExternalized Authorization\\n\\nThe final option is to use yet another external system. In this scenario, you\\nhave three architectural components:\\n\\n  * the CIAM server\\n\\n  * the application\\n\\n  * the authorization server\\n\\nThe first two are present in any of the previous option, but the latter is\\nnew.\\n\\nYou extract the access control rules to a separate server. The CIAM server is\\nresponsible for authentication, the application for business logic, and the\\nauthorization server for making decisions about whether application actions\\nare allowed. Doing so usually requires the application to make a request to\\nthe authorization server.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n\\n  * You have centralized rule sets at the authorization server and should be able to reason about access in a coherent fashion.\\n\\n  * You can use mathematically provable rules to enforce access. While this is possible in other solutions, the separate authorization framework makes this more likely.\\n\\n  * Having a separate CIAM server you can have all applications rely on for undifferentiated yet critical functionality is helpful and and an authorization server offers similar benefits.\\n\\nChallenges:\\n\\n  * Mo architecture, mo problems. It's another server or service to care and feed.\\n\\n  * Calls to the authorization server become embedded in the application.\\n\\n  * If the authorization server's rule definitions aren't flexible enough, you're forced to code logic into your application.\\n\\n###\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nHope you enjoyed this tour of authorization logic location. Which is right for\\nyour app?\\n\\nThe correct answer is \\u2018it depends\\u2019 but I\\u2019d try to keep it as simple as\\npossible as you build out and improve your application or applications.\\n\\nDan\\n\\n### Subscribe to CIAM Weekly\\n\\nBy Dan Moore \\u00b7 Launched a year ago\\n\\nCustomer Identity and access management news and analysis.\\n\\nShare this post\\n\\n#### Where Is User Authorization Data Stored?\\n\\nciamweekly.substack.com\\n\\nShare\\n\\nComments\\n\\nCIAM for the single application\\n\\nOne of the key ways that a CIAM server can help is to offer one place for your\\nusers to login across a suite of applications.

I tried using Firefox and it looked good on my end: I could\\nsee and hear the other person. But they just saw a blank video feed and heard\\nnothing. Firefox showed me that it's sending, but it never goes through to\\nthem. This happened with Google Meet, a body doubling platform, and a\\ntelehealth platform, all using different underlying video services.\\n\\nI'm a software engineer, and I run Fedora on my personal laptop. This\\nparticular bug was on the latest version, and by running a bleeding-edge\\ndistribution I got cut. I didn't have the same issue on my work laptop,\\nrunning an LTS version of Ubuntu. So in some ways, it's a problem of my own\\nmaking, and there was a workaround.\\n\\nBut that's the problem. I have to be so careful about which version of Firefox\\nI have installed, because things break tremendously now and then. Even on the\\nbleeding edge, a showstopper bug like this one\\u2014and this is not the first time\\nsomething similar has happened to me\\u2014means that I cannot rely on having\\nFirefox around as my only browser. I have to have everything setup in Chromium\\nas well, because Firefox will let me down.\\n\\nIn some ways, the constant breakage is not Firefox's fault. When web\\napplications are only tested in Chromium, they will inevitably have bugs that\\nare showstoppers in non-Chrome browsers. Yet other problems do seem to be\\nFirefox's fault, like this issue with video calls. But at the end of the day,\\nit doesn't matter whose fault it is. If users cannot reliably use a browser\\nfor everyday tasks, they will switch and never look back. Whether they move to\\nChrome or Edge or Brave, those are all Chrome under the hood.\\n\\nIt's gettin gharder to keep using Firefox, but I do, because preserving the\\nfree web requires that we have more stakeholders than just Google (and Apple).\\nWe used to have Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla all at the table to\\nprserve the free web. But now Microsoft uses the Chromium engine, and while\\nApple is a strong influence thanks to iOS, that influence may erode due to\\nEuropean regulators compelling them to allow alternative browser engines on\\niOS.\\n\\nIt's almost impossible to argue for other people using Firefox. The abstract\\ndamage of the loss of the free web, of handing control to Google, is\\nintangible and pales in comparison to the real pains of using a lesser browser\\ndaily. We're too removed from the benefits of browser engine diversity right\\nnow to make the case.\\n\\nI hope that under Mozilla's new CEO, they'll recover their footing. They're\\nleaning into data privacy. Not everyone cares about it, but enough people do\\nthat maybe we'll regain a clear pitch for Firefox for regular everyday user.\\nFor now, I'm still defaulting to Firefox, but it's harder with each\\nshowstopper bug. And someday, maybe I won't open it first anymore.\\n\\nI'm afraid of that day.\\n\\nIf this post was enjoyable or useful for you, please share it!

Everything is exactly the way they look and there is no hidden\\nmagic. The framework consists of 5.5 independent libraries which tackle unique\\nconcerns in front-end development. We avoid repeating standard functions in\\nthe javascript language and instead focus on new primitives which complement\\nand enhance them. After reading this guide to the framework along with their\\ninline documentation and the attached examples (2), there is nothing left to\\nlearn except more standard HTML, CSS and Javascript.\\n\\n## The Libraries\\n\\n  1. Arender\\n\\nArender is an async templating library which supports promises. Rendering will\\nnaturally await all interpolated promises before returning a result.\\n\\n  2. Apriori\\n\\nApriori is used to create template DOM trees out of things that can be\\nconverted to DOM trees, such as existing trees, markup or promises or\\nfunctions that can return them. It is a convenient abstraction for avoiding\\nrepetitive coding.\\n\\n  3. Sophistry\\n\\nSophistry will help with scoping styles whether or not we use shadow DOM.\\n\\n  4. Eventivity\\n\\nThis is the main library of this framework. Eventivity enables simple and\\nexplicit reactivity by simply wrapping normal functions and statements with\\nappropriate calls. See the usage notes.\\n\\n  5. Domitory\\n\\nDomitory exports a set of pragmatic functions (and a class) for enhancing some\\ntraditional DOM apparatus. Some of these may likely be assimilated into the\\nJavascript standard eventually.\\n\\n  6. Actribute\\n\\nActribute provides a more widely supported, flexible and powerful alternative\\nto extending built-in HTML elements.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nnpm install eventiveness\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n  1. Arender\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    import { arender } from \\\"./arender.js\\\"; const template = arender(\\\"<div>${arg1}</div>${arg2}\\\", ['arg1', 'arg2']); const renderedA = template('Arg 1a', Promise.resolve('Arg 2a')); const renderedB = template('Arg 1b', Promise.resolve('Arg 2b'));\\n\\n  2. Apriori\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    import { apriori } from './apriori.js' const viewFactory = await apriori(fetch('html-fragment.html).then(r => r.text())); const differentViews = [viewFactory(), viewFactory()];\\n\\n  3. Sophistry\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    import { sophistry } from '../sophistry.js' const mySophistry = sophistry(); const styles = mySophistry(element); for (let style of styles) style.style(element);\\n\\n  4. Eventivity\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    import { eventivity } from '../eventivity.js'; const myEventivity = eventivity(); const e = myEventivity.event(); const h = myEventivity.handler(); const handlerFunction = (...args) => 'I reacted!'; h.eventName(handlerFunction); let variable; e.eventName(variable = 'handlerFunction' + 'RunsAfterMe!');\\n\\n  5. Domitory\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    import { Fragment, apply, onEnter, addEventListener } from '../domitory.js'; const = window.myForm; // form with id myForm. apply({ input: input => { onEnter(input, () => login(input.value), true); apply({ '#loginButton': button => { addEventListener(button, 'click', () => login(input.value)); } }, form); } }, form);\\n\\n  6. Actribute\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    import { actribute } from '../actribute.js'; const fallbackProps = {prop1: 'Fallback', prop4: 'Last resort'}; const {comp, act} = actribute(fallbackProps); act.register('comp1', (node, prop1) => node.textContent = prop1); act.register('comp2', (node, prop2) => node.style.left = prop2); // ... other components. delete act.registry.comp2;\\n    \\n    \\n    <main> <section o-comp1=\\\"prop1\\\" o-comp2=\\\"prop2\\\" > First section </section> <section o-comp3 o-comp4=\\\"prop2\\\" > Second section </section> </main>\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you like the concept and/or the direction of Eventiveness framework, please\\ncontribute to this project. Contribution starts with a simple starring of this\\nrepository. Next you can start or join discussions about this project, here or\\nanywhere. You can contribute some of your use-cases to the list of examples.\\nYou can still help improve the documentation, complete the site, consolidate\\nfeatures and fix bugs.

Credit: Nature\\nReviews Psychology (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s44159-024-00295-z\\n\\nA pair of psychologists, one with Washington University in St. Louis, the\\nother with the University of Zurich, has found via review of prior research\\nthat there are four key mechanisms involved when a person truly wants to make\\nchanges\\u2014albeit small changes\\u2014to their personality.\\n\\nIn their paper, published in the journal Nature Reviews Psychology, Joshua\\nJackson and Amanda Wright describe the four mechanisms and how they might be\\nused by someone attempting to change their personality.\\n\\nA common adage is that human beings develop a personality in their youth and\\nthat once set, it becomes permanent. There is reportedly no way to change\\none's personality\\u2014if a person is greedy, grumpy or happy-go-lucky, they remain\\nthat way until they die. But research over the past several decades has shown\\nthat these beliefs are not exactly true.\\n\\nAs the researchers note, while a given personality remains in place for most\\nof a person's lifespan, there are examples showing that some changes are\\npossible if there is a strong desire to make them. In this review, Jackson and\\nWright have uncovered four key mechanisms that come into play when someone\\nsucceeds in making personality changes.\\n\\nThe first mechanism involves preconditions, which are the tools needed to\\nalter personality. The second involves making changes to the living\\nenvironment\\u2014doing so, they suggest, can remove triggers that push a person\\nback to prior personality traits. Such changes lead to the third mechanism:\\nreinforcers. These are elements in a person's life that lend support to a\\ndesirable personality trait. Finally, the fourth mechanism involves\\nintegrators, which are factors that allow a person to maintain continued\\nsupport for new traits after they have been attained.\\n\\nThe researchers note that one of the most important factors in attempting to\\nmake personality changes is a strong desire to succeed\\u2014a person has to want to\\nmake changes and have good reasons for wanting them. Otherwise, they note,\\nthey will be fighting their own desires to return to previous traits.\\n\\nThe researchers also note that timing can be important. Making changes when\\nmoving to a new place, getting married or having a baby, for example, can\\nprovide ample incentive not only to make changes, but to retain them.\\n\\nMore information: Joshua J.
