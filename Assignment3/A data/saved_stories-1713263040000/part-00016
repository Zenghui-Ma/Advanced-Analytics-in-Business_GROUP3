This will enable us to be\nlean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.\"\n\nA Tesla employee who had been told he was being let go told the BBC he had\nsubsequently been locked out of his emails, as had all other staff being laid\noff.\n\nOne of the executive team, Andrew \"Drew\" Baglino, said in a post on X\n(formerly Twitter) on Monday he had made the \"difficult decision\" to leave the\nfirm after 18 years.\n\n#### Allow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some analysts\ndescribed the results as \"tumultuous.\"\n\nLast month, Tesla reduced production at the Gigafactory in Shanghai and last\nweek Tesla told employees who work on the Cybertruck that shifts will be\nshorter on the production line at the Austin.\n\nTesla has begun to feel the impact of slowing demand for electric vehicles\n(EVs).\n\nElon Musk has recently denied reports that the company has scrapped plans to\nproduce an inexpensive car, which has been one of his longstanding goals to\nmake affordable EVs for the masses.\n\nTesla shares were down 0.8% in premarket trading on Monday.\n\n## Tesla 'disaster' with fewest deliveries since 2022\n\n## Chinese smartphone giant takes on Tesla\n\n## Tesla warns of 'notably lower' sales growth in 2024\n\n## Tesla to settle over fatal Autopilot crash\n\nElon Musk\n\nTesla\n\nTransport\n\nRelated\n\n## My battle with Tesla: I want to clear my name before I die\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nTechnology\n\n## Elon Musk to visit India for meeting with PM Modi\n\n5 days ago\n\nAsia\n\n## Tesla to settle over fatal Autopilot crash\n\n7 days ago\n\nTechnology\n\nMore\n\n14 hrs ago\n\n## Railway station bridge lowered into place\n\nTwo massive cranes were involved in the operation to put the new bridge in\nplace\n\n14 hrs ago\n\nScotland\n\n16 hrs ago\n\n## What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?\n\nIf you face disruption because flights are cancelled or delayed, then what can\nyou do?\n\n16 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n18 hrs ago\n\n## Rail station bridge replacement lowered into place\n\nTwo massive cranes helped put the structure in place to improve passenger\naccess in Dumfries.\n\n18 hrs ago\n\nSouth Scotland\n\n22 hrs ago\n\n## Bus passengers stunned after six routes withdrawn\n\nThe local council says it is coming up with new timetables after a bus company\ncancelled services.\n\n22 hrs ago\n\nEngland\n\n3 days ago\n\n## City park and ride car park to be expanded\n\nSniperley Park and Ride in Durham will have almost 600 parking spaces, up from\nits current 326.\n\n3 days ago\n\nEngland\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
