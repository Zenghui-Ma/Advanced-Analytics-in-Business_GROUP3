It's the ideal spot to search for the fossils of Martian\nmicrobes that may have existed when the planet was lush with lakes and rivers.\n\nThe remains of an ancient river delta at the edge of Jezero Crater, captured\nby the ESA's Mars Express orbiter. ESA/DLR/FU-Berlin\n\nPerseverance's main mission is to collect samples of the rock and sediment\nalong the lake bed and the crater rim, in hopes of finding a sign that life\nonce thrived on the red planet. The rover has done a fine job \u2014 so far it's\nsecured 24 samples \u2014 but NASA no longer knows how it's going to bring them to\nEarth for analysis.\n\nThose aren't light sabers, they're Perseverance's sample tubes, stashed on the\nMartian surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nNASA's original design for the retrieval mission, called Mars Sample Return,\nhas fallen apart. The agency is asking companies to step in and propose better\nideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are looking at out-of-the-box possibilities that could return the samples\nearlier and at a lower cost,\" Nicola Fox, head of NASA's Science Mission\nDirectorate, said in a press briefing on Monday. \"This is definitely a very\nambitious goal. We're going to need to go after some very innovative new\npossibilities for design, and certainly leave no stone unturned.\"\n\n## NASA's old plan costs $11 billion and takes too long\n\nPerseverance used its sample-collection arm to try coring a Mars rock on\nAugust 6, 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU\n\nNASA's original proposal for the Mars Sample Return is \"mind-bendingly\ncomplicated,\" David Parker, director of space exploration at the European\nSpace Agency, said in 2021.\n\nThe idea was to launch two rockets toward Mars, one carrying a lander and one\ncarrying an orbiter.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe lander would be the largest ever sent to Mars. It would touch down near\nthe stash of samples that Perseverance set up, deploy a rover to fetch the\nsample tubes, and load them onto a small rocket attached to the lander.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn illustration shows a concept of how NASA's Mars Sample Return mission would\nlaunch Perseverance's samples from the surface of Mars. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThen the rocket would launch the samples into Mars orbit, where it would eject\nthem toward the orbiter, which would be the largest spacecraft NASA ever sent\nto Mars.\n\nThis illustration shows a concept for a rocket (left) releasing a sample\ncontainer (right) high above the Martian surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe orbiter would have to grab the samples, journey back to Earth, and drop\nthe sample vessel on a fiery plummet to our planet's surface, where a team\nwould retrieve them.\n\nThe mission plan relied about $4 billion in new technology and a decade of\nmission design and construction.\n\nBut the projected cost has ballooned to $8 to $11 billion since Perseverance\ntouched down at Jezero Crater. Independent reviews have also concluded that\ninstead of one decade to bring the samples to Earth, it would take two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The bottom line is that $11 billion is too expensive, and not returning\nsamples until 2040 is unacceptably too long,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson\nsaid in the briefing. \"It's the decade of the 2040s that we're going to be\nlanding astronauts on Mars.\"\n\nAt the current price tag, Mars Sample Return would \"cannibalize\" other NASA\nmissions, Nelson said. So the agency is calling all hands on deck, inside and\noutside of NASA, to come up with a new plan.\n\n## NASA wants companies with 'tried-and-true' technology\n\nFox said that NASA needs to see short proposals from companies or laboratories\nby May 17. Then the agency will choose a few of those competitors to further\ndevelop their ideas over a 90-day period, with complete proposals on NASA's\ndesk by late fall or early winter.\n\nSome of NASA's most tried-and-true contractors include Lockheed Martin,\nNorthrop Grumman, Boeing, and SpaceX. Startups like Astrobotic and Intuitive\nMachines are getting their foot in the NASA door through the agency's new moon\nprogram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What we're hoping is that we will be able to get back to some more\ntraditional tried-and-true architectures,\" Fox said. \"Anything requiring huge\nleaps in technology usually, from experience, takes a lot of time.\"\n\nAs for the return trip from Mars to Earth, that will be a technological leap\nno matter what.\n\n\"We've never launched from another planet, and that's actually what makes Mars\nSample Return such a challenging and interesting mission because it really is\nthe first of a kind,\" Fox said.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch:\n\nNASA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
