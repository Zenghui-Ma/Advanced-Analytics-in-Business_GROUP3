No more Jobol or\nCava.\n\nLicense Free\n\nModernised code makes use of Open Source libraries and cloud primitives where\npossible to maximise cost savings.\n\nReady to Change\n\nAfter conversion, code can be modified and extended without the need for\nrefactoring, useful for meeting tight deadlines.\n\nContinuous Delivery\n\nThere's no requirement for a code freeze during the conversion process,\nkeeping your project on track.\n\nWrite\n\n## The AI Pair Programmer That Writes COBOL\n\nmAInframer-1 is the first large language model trained specifically for COBOL\ndevelopers\n\nWrite faster\n\nCoding copilots have been shown to improve developer productivity by 55%.\n\nOpen source\n\nAll of the code used to train the model is Open Source and licensed for\ncommercial use.\n\nRuns offline\n\nThe AI model runs entirely offline on your device, so no internet connection\nis needed.\n\nUnderstand\n\n## Ask Questions About Your Codebase in Natural Language\n\nUnderstand a codebase autonomously without asking colleagues or reading\ndocumentation\n\nAvailable on\n\nCode Navigation\n\nNavigate to function definitions and find example usage, supports 10+\nlanguages.\n\nNatural Language\n\nAsk questions in natural language, just as you\u2019d ask a colleague.\n\nMulti-Repo\n\nWith multi-repo search, you can understand the relationship between different\ncodebases and how different services interact.\n\nRegex Matching\n\nOur purpose build regex engine matches code, identifiers and paths.\n\nDiffing\n\nRebuild or rewrite from scratch while preserving its scope and specifications.\n\nDocumentation Libraries\n\nImport a documentation library and let bloop write code for you.\n\nProduct\n\nWriteUnderstandModernise\n\nCompany\n\nBlogContact us\n\nSocials\n\nJoin DiscordFollow us on X\n\nGitHub \u00b7 8528\n\nT&CsPrivacy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
