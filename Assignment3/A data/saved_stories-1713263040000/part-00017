The Electronic Advanced Ground Launcher System\n(EAGLS) is very similar in form and function to U.S.-supplied VAMPIREs that\nUkrainians are now using in combat. The purchase of the EAGLS came just days\nahead of Iran's unprecedented missile and drone strikes on Israel, which have\nonly added to long-standing concerns about uncrewed aerial and other threats\nto U.S. forces in the region.\n\nNaval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced on April 12 that it had awarded a\nfirm-fixed-price contract with a not-to-exceed value of $24,186,464 to MSI\nDefense Solutions for the purchase of five EAGLS Counter-Unmanned Aerial\nSystems (C-UAS). This sole-source deal also includes various ancillary items\nand training support.\n\nEAGLS uses laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Killer Weapon System II (APKWS\nII) rockets, as seen in the video below, to knock down drones.\n\n\"This contract action is\" in response to an urgent need to respond to\n\"emerging and persistent UAS threats in the United States Central Command\n(USCENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR),\" according to an associated\nJustification and Approval document the Navy released. U.S. government\nagencies have to submit justification documents like this in order to receive\nauthority to award contracts without going through normal competitive bidding\nprocesses.\n\n\"Immediate contract award is critical due to the urgent need of ongoing\noperations in the USCENTCOM AOR,\" according to the J&A document. \"If the\nimmediate procurement is not made, U.S. Forces will not receive necessary\ncritical C-UAS systems as required for capability in theater.\"\n\nThe J&A says that the goal is for the first EAGLS to be fielded within 30 days\nof the contract award.\n\nEAGLS is a self-contained system that consists of three main parts: a version\nof the Commonly Remotely Operated Weapon Station II (CROWS II) fitted with a\nfour-round 70mm rocket launcher loaded with laser-guided Advanced Precision\nKill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets, a sensor turret with electro-optical\nand infrared cameras, and a small radar array. The system is designed to be\ndeployed in either palletized or vehicle-mounted forms. MSI's website shows a\nversion installed mounted on a pickup truck-style variant of the 4x4 Humvee\nlight utility vehicle, as is seen at the top of this story.\n\nA palletized version of the EAGLS counter-drone system. Note the additional\nfour-round rocket launchers on the pallet, which could be preloaded and\nswapped out for the one mounted on the CROWS II to help more rapidly reload\nthe system. MSI Defense Solutions\n\nThe radar used with EAGLS is a Leonardo DRS RPS-40, a member of the company's\nMulti-Mission Hemispheric Radar (MHS) family. This radar, which is a compact\nS-band active electronically scanned array (AESA) type, can detect targets up\nto 10 kilometers (just over 6 miles) away, according to the manufacturer,\nthough this would be dependent on their size and other factors. The RPS-40 is\nan increasingly popular radar that several other counter-drone and short-range\nair defense systems make use of, including the U.S. Army's Mobile Short Range\nAir Defense (M-SHORAD) variant of the 8x8 Stryker wheeled armored vehicle.\n\nMSI's offering is one of a growing number of counter-drone systems utilizing\nAPKWS II rockets and otherwise with similar overall configurations that are\ndesigned to be platform agnostic. This includes L3Harris' VAMPIRE, examples of\nwhich NAVAIR has directly helped deliver to Ukraine, and that have now proven\nthemselves in combat.\n\nA VAMPIRE counter-drone system bound for Ukraine. USN\n\nThe U.S. Army has also been working on a containerized counter-drone system\nthat makes use of a modified CROWS II with a four-round 70mm rocket launcher\nand a different MHS-series radar from Leonardo DRS, as well as a camera-\nequipped sensor turret, which you can read more about here.\n\nThe addition of the radar gives the EAGLS additional capability and\nflexibility over VAMPIRE configurations that have been seen to date, the only\nsensors in which are turrets with electro-optical and infrared cameras. A\nradar like the RPS-40 gives operators of systems like EAGLS more advanced\nwarning of potential threats and better data about where they are coming from.\nIt is unclear whether EAGLS' 70mm launcher can be automatically cued to the\nsystem's radar and/or its senor turret, but this seems likely and would be\nhighly desirable.\n\nThe addition of the radar does mean that EAGLS puts out additional radio\nfrequency signals that more advanced enemy forces could use to detect and\nlocate its position. The sensor turret does not give off a passive target\ndetection and engagement capability that could be used even if the radar is\nswitched off to reduce the system's signature in the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nAPKWS II rockets can be employed against ground targets giving C-UAS systems\nbased around these weapons an inherent surface-to-surface attack capability.\nOriginally designed as air-to-ground munitions, these rockets also have a\ndemonstrated capability in the air-to-air role against drones, as well as\ncruise missiles.\n\nThe laser-guided rockets are modular and low-cost, with the guidance section\ndesigned to slot in between existing standardized 70mm warheads and rocket\nmotors. The unit cost of the APKWS II guidance section is around $25,000, with\nthe warhead and rocket motor together typically only costing a few thousand\ndollars more depending on their exact types, according to Navy budget\ndocuments. For comparison, the cost of a single Coyote Block 2 interceptor,\nanother counter-drone weapon currently deployed to help protect U.S. Forces in\nthe Middle East, is reportedly roughly around $100,000. Current generation\nStinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, which include new\nfeatures to improve their effectiveness against drones, have a unit cost of\naround $400,000.\n\nNAVAIR has previously announced that it has been working with the APKWS II's\nprime contractor, BAE Sytems, on the development of a new proximity-fuzed\nwarhead specifically optimized for use against drones.\n\nWhere exactly in the Middle East the EAGLS might be headed and what specific\nthreats prompted their purchase is unknown. However, Navy Rear Adm. Stephen\nTedford, head of NAVAIR's Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and\nStrike Weapons (PEO U&W), made comments at the annual Sea Air Space conference\nlast week that suggest these systems could be headed to bolster counter-drone\ndefenses at Navy and other U.S. military facilities in the Persian Gulf.\n\n\"A lot going on in the space of with APKWS in regards to counter-UAS services.\nSo, with everything that's been going on in the Red Sea that you're all\nfamiliar with in the news, APKWS is providing us a much more affordable\napproach to getting after the counter UAV [uncrewed aerial vehicle] space,\"\nTedford said. The situation in the Red Sea that Tedford was referring to is\nthe ongoing anti-ship campaign by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen.\nThe Houthis have used ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, to\nattack commercial vessels and foreign warships in the region.\n\n\"We're working on a system now that will be deployed in [the] 5th Fleet [area\nof responsibility] to provide base security and force protection for our\nservices in the [Persian] Gulf.\" Tedford continued.\n\nU.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) and the U.S. 5th Fleet have their\nheadquarters in Bahrain right on the Gulf. U.S. forces also operate from\nseveral major air bases, as well as smaller facilities, across the Arabian\nPeninsula. Vessels sitting in port are particularly vulnerable to drone\nstrikes, as has been underscored by the Houthi's recent targeting of Israeli\nwarships in Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\nThere is still a possibility that EAGLS could be deployed elsewhere in the\nMiddle East outside of the Persian Gulf. U.S. forces are forward-deployed at a\nconstellation of larger bases and smaller sites across the region, including\nones in Israel, where there are also drone threats. In addition, the Navy\nrecently expressed interest in new ways to rapidly add counter-drone defenses\nto its warships themselves. A palletized system like EAGLS could be an option\nfor helping to meet that demand, as well.\n\nIn his comments last week, Tedford also cited the value of experience that\nNAVAIR has gained from working with Ukraine on the VAMPIRE system. The\nconflict in Ukraine has helped bring the threat posed by drones into the\nmainstream consciousness.\n\nHowever, the threat posed by drones, including to U.S. forces at home, as well\nas abroad, is anything but new, as The War Zone has been highlighting for\nyears now. Just in January, Iranian-backed proxy forces killed three U.S.\nservicemembers at a forward operating base in Jordan with a kamikaze drone\nattack, highlighting the very real danger even lower-tier uncrewed aerial\nsystem present.\n\nPotential drone threats in the Gulf region have only grown in the wake of\nIran's unprecedented missile and drone strikes on Israel over the weekend.\nAuthorities in Tehran have threatened to retaliate against U.S. forces across\nthe Middle East if they aid their Israeli counterparts in any future strikes\non Iran. Any such Iranian response could come in full or in part through its\nproxies, as well. U.S. bases in the Gulf region are well within range of\nkamikaze drones, as well as missiles, that the Houthis have in their arsenal.\n\nIt is worth noting that an order for five EAGLS represents a relatively small\nadditional counter-drone capability. The overall nature of the acquisition\nalso seems to reflect that the U.S. military is still playing catch-up to the\ndrone threat, even in the face of ever-growing evidence of its seriousness,\nincluding the recent attacks on Israel. U.S. forces, including warships\noffshore, combat jets, and ground-based air defenses, were heavily engaged in\ndefending Israel from that incoming barrage of missiles and drones.\n\nOverall, the new EAGLSs look set to provide important additional counter-drone\ncapabilities to U.S. forces in the Middle East, but the purchase of these\nsystems also underscores the need for much more capacity in this regard.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com\n\nAround The GlobeCounter-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (C-UAS)Directed\nEnergyDronesLasersMiddle EastNaviesU.S. NavyUnmanned\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
