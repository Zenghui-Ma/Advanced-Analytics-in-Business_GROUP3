And now, the brand is targeting AI in the latest iteration of its\ndecades-old Real Beauty campaign.\n\nThe brand announced this week that it will never use AI-generated imagery to\nrepresent \u201creal bodies\u201d in its ads. And in a powerful short film, it takes aim\nat the generic and unrealistic beauty standards depicted in images churned out\nin text prompts such as \"the most beautiful woman in the world.\" (For more\ngreat ad campaigns, check out the best print ads of all time.)\n\n\"Today, almost 9 in 10 women and girls say they have been exposed to harmful\nbeauty content online,\" Dove announces. \"One of the biggest threats to the\nrepresentation of real beauty is Artificial Intelligence. With 90% of the\ncontent online expected to be AI-generated by 2025, the rise of AI is a threat\nto women's wellbeing, with 1 in 3 women feel pressure to alter their\nappearance because of what they see online, even when they know it's fake or\nAI generated.\"\n\n> Kudos to @Dove for rejecting AI imagery & only using real ppl in its ads.\n> Great products, great company\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4fApril 9, 2024\n\nSee more\n\n> I really agree with Dove's action. Real Beauty should be real. It is truly\n> improper to use an AI-generated perfect model to showcase beauty. Dove\n> pledges to not use AI models in lieu of real women in its advertising\n> https://t.co/c1PMXgEGl4 via @marketingdive #NYUDigitalMarketingApril 9, 2024\n\nSee more\n\nAlessandro Manfredi, chief marketing officer at Dove, adds, \"At Dove, we seek\na future in which women get to decide and declare what real beauty looks like\n\u2013 not algorithms. As we navigate the opportunities and challenges that come\nwith new and emerging technology, we remain committed to protect, celebrate,\nand champion Real Beauty. Pledging to never use AI in our communications is\njust one step. We will not stop until beauty is a source of happiness, not\nanxiety, for every woman and girl.\"\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloq\n\nIndeed, over the 20 year course of its Real Beauty campaign, Dove has\nrepeatedly proven itself to be a force for good.
