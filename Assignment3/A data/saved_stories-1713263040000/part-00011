Lee on June 2, 2014\n\nThe internet increasingly pervades our lives, delivering information to us no\nmatter where we are. It takes a complex system of cables, servers, towers, and\nother infrastructure, developed over decades, to allow us to stay in touch\nwith our friends and family so effortlessly. Here are 40 maps that will help\nyou better understand the internet \u2014 where it came from, how it works, and how\nit's used by people around the world.\n\n### How the internet was created\n\n  1. #### Before the internet, there was the ARPANET\n\nBBN / DARPA\n\n#### Before the internet, there was the ARPANET\n\nARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, was an academic research\nproject funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a branch of the\nmilitary known for funding ambitious research projects without immediate\ncommercial or military applications. Initially, the network only connected the\nUniversity of Utah with three research centers in California. ARPANET was a\ntest of a then-novel technology called packet-switching, which breaks data\ninto small \"packets\" so they can be transmitted efficiently across the\nnetwork. It also had a more practical goal: allowing more efficient use of\nexpensive computing resources. Computer scientists sometimes used ARPA money\nto buy computers, and the agency hoped that ARPANET would allow universities\nto share these expensive resources more efficiently. One of the first ARPANET\napplications was Telnet, which allowed a researcher at one ARPANET site to log\ninto a computer at another site.\n\n  2. #### 1970: ARPANET expands\n\nBBN / DARPA\n\n#### 1970: ARPANET expands\n\nBy the end of 1970, ARPANET had grown to 13 nodes, including East Coast\nschools like Harvard and MIT. Among the early nodes was Bolt, Beranek, and\nNewman (BBN), an engineering consulting company that did the engineering work\nrequired to build ARPANET. Each ARPANET site had a router known as an\nInterface Message Processor. These cost $82,200, or half a million dollars in\ntoday's money.\n\n  3. #### 1973: ARPANET goes international\n\nBBN / DARPA\n\n#### 1973: ARPANET goes international\n\nIn 1973, the ARPANET became international, with a satellite link connecting\nNorway and London to the other nodes in the United States. Hawaii also joined\nthe network by satellite. At this point, the network had around 40 nodes. New\nARPANET applications had begun to emerge. Email was invented in 1971 by a BBN\nengineer named Ray Tomlinson, who also invented the use of the \"@\" symbol in\nemail addresses. The File Transfer Protocol, which is still used today,\nallowed ARPANET users to send files to each other.\n\n  4. #### 1982: the ARPANET community grows\n\nBBN / DARPA\n\n#### 1982: the ARPANET community grows\n\nAs the ARPANET entered its second decade, it was still largely confined to the\nUnited States. Academic institutions depended on federal funding to join the\nnetwork, so the number of nodes expanded slowly. By 1982, the network only had\nabout 100 nodes. But that was enough to support a vibrant online community.\nLong before Facebook and Twitter, ARPANET allowed computer scientists who had\naccess to the network to stay in touch. A new bulletin board system called\nUsenet was invented in 1980 and caught on quickly. Usenet was organized by\ntopic, allowing users to swap programming tips, recipes, jokes, opinions about\nscience fiction, and much more.\n\n  5. #### 1984: ARPANET becomes the internet\n\nNSF\n\n#### 1984: ARPANET becomes the internet\n\nOriginally, the entire ARPANET was managed by the military. But network\noperators realized that a centralized network would eventually become\nunmanageable if it continued to grow. They decided that the network should be\nreorganized as a decentralized \"network of networks.\" Under this scheme,\ndifferent networks would be controlled by different organizations, but all the\nnetworks able to communicate using shared standards, forming a shared\n\"internet.\" The military asked the computer scientists Robert Kahn and Vint\nCerf to develop new networking standards to make this possible. The result was\na set of standards known as TCP/IP. These standards specified the basic format\nof data packets transmitted across the internet. On January 1, 1983, the\nARPANET switched to using TCP/IP, marking the birth of the modern internet.\nThe switch to TCP/IP didn't make much difference from a user perspective \u2014\napplications like email and Telnet worked about the same as they had before.\nBut the new standard paved the way for much faster network growth by lowering\nthe barrier to entry for new networks. One of the first new networks to\nconnect to the new internet was CSNET, which was funded by the National\nScience Foundation to link computer science departments across the country.\nThis map shows the location of ARPANET and CSNET nodes (labeled \"Phonenet\"),\nwhich after 1983 communicated with each other using TCP/IP. By the time the\nARPANET was decommissioned in 1990, it was just one of many networks that\ncomprised the internet. Today, the internet is made up of more than 40,000\ndifferent networks. These networks still communicate with each other using the\nTCP/IP standards Cerf and Kahn developed in the 1970s.\n\n  6. #### NSFNET: The first internet backbone\n\nMerit Network, Inc.\n\n#### NSFNET: The first internet backbone\n\nDuring the 1980s, the National Science Network funded several supercomputing\ncenters around the United States. And in 1986 the agency created a TCP/IP-\nbased network called NSFNET to link those supercomputing centers together and\nallow researchers across the country to use them. The primary goal was to\nallow computer science researchers to log into the supercomputers and perform\nacademic research. But NSF decided not to limit NSFNET to that purpose,\nallowing the network to be used for a wide variety of academic purposes. As a\nresult, the NSFNET became the internet's \"backbone,\" the high-speed, long-\ndistance network that allowed different parts of the internet to communicate.\nSchools that didn't have a direct connection to the NSFNET worked together to\nbuild regional networks that linked them to each other and to the nearest NSF\nnode. This shows the NSFNET as it existed in 1992. By this time, there were\n6,000 networks connected to NSFNET, with a third of them located overseas.\nThat meant that students and faculty at a growing number of universities had\naccess to email, Usenet, and even a recently-invented application called the\nWorld Wide Web. And although the NSFNET was officially restricted to non-\ncommercial use, for-profit companies were increasingly connecting to the\nnetwork as well, setting the stage for the commercialization of the internet\nthat followed.\n\n  7. #### The internet becomes a global network\n\nBrian Reid\n\n#### The internet becomes a global network\n\nIn 1993, the internet was still dominated by the United States but it was\nbecoming a truly global network. This is a map of information flow on Usenet,\nan bulletin board application that allowed users to swap recipes, jokes,\nprogramming tips, and more.\n\n  8. #### The privatization of the internet backbone\n\nVerizon, AT&T, Sprint, and Level 3\n\n#### The privatization of the internet backbone\n\nIn 1994, the Clinton Administration privatized the internet backbone.\nCommercial firms took over the job of carrying long-distance internet traffic,\nallowing the government-funded NSFNET to be decommissioned. Officials were\ncareful to ensure that no single company controlled too much of the backbone,\nhelping to create a competitive market for internet connectivity that still\nexists today. These four maps illustrate how the market had evolved by the\nturn of the century. Four of the largest private long-distance network\nproviders were UUNet, AT&T, Sprint, and Level 3. Each had its own nationwide\n(and global) network, and they competed with each other to provide long-\ndistance connectivity to smaller networks. UUNet became part of WorldCom in\n1996, and became part of Verizon in 2006. Today, Verizon operates one of the\nworld's largest internet backbones, in competition with AT&T, Sprint, Level 3\nand many other companies.\n\n### The internet around the world\n\n  9. #### The internet conquers the world\n\nreddit user DMan9797, based on World Bank data\n\n#### The internet conquers the world\n\nBy 2000, almost half of Americans were on the internet, but ordinary people in\nmost other countries had not yet joined the network. There were fewer than 400\nmillion internet users worldwide. Since then, the internet has gone from an\nAmerican network to a truly global one. This map illustrates how the internet\ncame first to wealthy countries, then to middle-income countries, and finally\nto poor countries. Today, there are more than 2.5 billion internet users, and\nhundreds of millions of new users are joining each year.\n\n  10. #### How the world gets online: fixed broadband penetration in 2012\n\nJeff Ogden\n\n#### How the world gets online: fixed broadband penetration in 2012\n\nThere are two basic ways people can log onto the internet: through a fixed\nbroadband connection at home or in an office and via a wireless connection on\na cell phone or tablet. This data from the International Telecommunications\nUnion shows how popular fixed internet access is around the world. It shows\ninternet access is widespread in most parts of the world, but is still fairly\nscarce in much of sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Fixed internet\naccess allows multiple devices in a customer's home to access the internet.\nFixed connections are also ideal for streaming-video services such as Netflix\nbecause they tend to have greater capacity than wireless networks.\n\n  11. #### How the world gets online: mobile broadband penetration in 2012\n\nJeff Ogden\n\n#### How the world gets online: mobile broadband penetration in 2012\n\nThis map shows the percentage of consumers around the world who have mobile\ninternet access (note that the colors on this map are not directly comparable\nto the previous map). In the developed world, people usually got fixed\ninternet access first and obtained mobile internet devices later. But some\ndeveloping countries are skipping the construction of fixed broadband networks\naltogether. This is cost-effective because a single cell phone tower can\nprovide service to hundreds of customers. For examle, 2.7 percent of Egyptians\nhave fixed broadband service at home, but 10 times as many Egyptians have\ninternet access using a cell phone. The story is similar in Ghana, Uzbekistan,\nIndonesia, South Africa, and Nigeria. Mobile internet access can have profound\nimplications for people in isolated areas. Farmers can use mobile phones to\nlearn about recent market developments, increasing the amount they can get for\ntheir crops. Some mobile phone operators also offer sophisticated payment\ncapabilities, allowing people who don't have access to the conventional\nbanking system to make electronic payments. A few wealthy countries, including\nJapan, South Korea, and Sweden, that have more mobile internet subscriptions\nthan people. Some customers have two more or smartphones, tablets, or other\nconnected mobile devices.\n\n  12. #### World broadband speeds, 2014\n\nreddit user DMan9797, based on Speedtest.net data\n\n#### World broadband speeds, 2014\n\nInternet access is a lot faster in some places than others. According to\nSpeedtest.net, a website that lets users test their own internet connections,\nthe fastest internet in the world is in Hong Kong, with an average of almost\n80 million bits per second (Mbps). Other high-speed countries include Japan,\nSouth Korea, Sweden, Romania, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The United\nStates clocks in at number 30, with average speeds of 24 Mbps. These figures\nare worth taking with a grain of salt because they're based on a self-selected\nsample. Users must visit the speedtest.net website to test their own broadband\nspeeds, and it stands to reason that users with fast connections would be most\nlikely to try it. Still, the data permits interesting cross-country\ncomparisons.\n\n  13. #### Who controls IP addresses\n\nARIN\n\n#### Who controls IP addresses\n\nFor the internet to work, everyone needs a unique Internet Protocol (IP)\naddress. To coordinate the distribution of these addresses, the internet is\nbroken up into five zones. Each zone has been assigned hundreds of millions of\nIP addresses to manage. Unfortunately, the original internet architecture,\ncalled IPv4, only allows for about 4 billion addresses, and the network has\nnearly exhausted the supply. The problem is particularly growing in fast-\ngrowing regions like Asia. Engineers have developed a long-run solution to\nthis problem: switching to a new internet standard called IPv6. IPv6 offers\nsuch a large number of potential addresses that the world will never run out.\nBut adoption of IPv6 has been slow. Today, the overwhelming majority of\ninternet traffic uses the old standard. But with few IPv4 addresses left,\npeople joining the internet in the future will have little choice but to use\nIPv6.\n\n  14. #### Domain names around the world\n\nKlaus W\u00f6rle\n\n#### Domain names around the world\n\nIP addresses have a numeric format like this: 216.146.46.10. But it's easier\nfor people to remember domain names such as vox.com. The domain name system\n(DNS) acts like a directory system, telling computers wanting to view a\nwebsite like www.vox.com what IP address to access. The system is\nhierarchical: the .com domain is managed by a company caled Verisign, which\nhas delegated to Vox the management of the vox.com domain. Domains like .com,\n.org, and .edu are called generic top-level domains, and they are especially\npopular in the United States. But other countries are more likely to use\nwhat's known as country-code top level domains (ccTLD). Every country in the\nworld has a ccTLD. This map shows the ccTLDs in Europe. For example, the\nUnited Kingdom's ccTLD is .uk, so the British Broadcasting Service's website\ncan be found at www.bbc.co.uk.\n\n  15. #### Some small island nations lend their domains to internet startups\n\nMarco Panizza\n\n#### Some small island nations lend their domains to internet startups\n\nEven very small countries get ccTLDs. Here's a close-up of the area around\nAustralia and the many small island nations that have their own domain names.\nSome of these countries realized that they could make a lot of money if they\nopened their domains to foreigners. The result: popular websites like last.fm\n(.fm is the domain of the Federated States of Micronesia) and twitch.tv (.tv\nis the domain for the island nation of Tuvalu). The .io domain, assigned to\nthe British Indian Ocean Territory, has become popular among programmers. They\nassociate the domain with the technical term input/output and use it to create\n\"artisinal websites.\" Click to see a full world map.\n\n  16. #### Fiber optic cables around the world\n\nTeleGeography\n\n#### Fiber optic cables around the world\n\nToday the fastest way to transmit information over long distances is with\nfiber optics \u2014 long, thin strands of glass that carry information as pulses of\nlight. Because a single fiber can transmit as much as 100 billion bits per\nsecond (100 Gbps, about ten thousand times faster than a typical home\nbroadband connection) and a cable can contain hundreds of fibers, a single\ncable can have enough capacity for the communications of millions of users.\nAll that data has proven irresistible to the National Security Agency, which\nhas developed a variety of techniques to scoop up data as it flows through\nfiber optic cables.\n\n### Threats to the internet\n\n  17. #### How internet access in Egypt was disrupted in 2008\n\nRenesys\n\n#### How internet access in Egypt was disrupted in 2008\n\nFiber optic cables are relatively fragile. In 2008, two fiber optic cables\nthat connect Middle Eastern countries to India were cut, leading to\ndisruptions for many internet users in Egypt and India. Some press reports\nsuggested that the damage was caused by a ship's anchor being dragged along\nthe bottom of the Mediterranean, but the Egyptian authorities have said no\nships were in the area at the time the cables were damaged. The exact cause of\nthe outage remains a mystery.\n\n  18. #### Countries at risk of getting disconnected from the internet\n\nRenesys\n\n#### Countries at risk of getting disconnected from the internet\n\nSometimes internet access is disrupted due to accidents. In other cases, it's\ndeliberate government policy. For example, during the 2011 Tahrir Square\nprotests, the Egyptian government cut off Egypt's connections to the rest of\nthe internet. This was possible because Egypt's links to the outside world\nwere controlled by a handful of large companies. This map shows which\ncountries have few enough links to the outside world to be at risk of this\nkind of censorship. Some countries, such as the United States, have dozens of\nlinks to the outside world, making a coordinated shutdown of the US internet\nalmost impossible. Others have many fewer links and are correspondingly more\nvulnerable to censorship.\n\n  19. #### Syria's largest city dropped off the internet in 2013\n\nRenesys\n\n#### Syria's largest city dropped off the internet in 2013\n\nIn April 2013, Syria's largest city, Aleppo, disappeared from the internet for\nseveral hours, one of several outages that have occurred during the civil war\nthere. The southern parts of Syria receive internet access from undersea fiber\noptic cables, but Aleppo accesses the internet via a land connection to\nTurkey. It's not clear if the outage was due to accidental damage from\nfighting in the area, or whether the regime of Bashar al-Assad had\ndeliberately disrupted rebel-held Aleppo's internet access. As the Washington\nPost's Andrea Peterson puts it, \"Internet outages in Syria have a curious\nhistory of happening at times convenient for the Assad regime.\"\n\n  20. #### How Superstorm Sandy looked to the internet\n\nZakir Durumeric, Eric Wustrow, and J. Alex Halderman\n\n#### How Superstorm Sandy looked to the internet\n\nWhen Superstorm Sandy hit New Jersey in October 2012, it knocked a number of\ncomputers off the internet. A team of computer scientists at the University of\nMichigan had recently built ZMap, a tool that allowed them to scan every\ncomputer on the internet in less than an hour. That allowed them to make this\nmap, which shows locations where the number of web servers running the SSL\nencryption software declined by 30 percent or more, which turns out to be a\ngood proxy for heavy storm damage.\n\n  21. #### Internet censorship around the world\n\nFreedom House\n\n#### Internet censorship around the world\n\nIn most Western countries, the internet is a free-speech zone where ordinary\npeople can express themselves without fear of censorship. But that's not true\neverywhere. This map from Freedom House details which countries respect\nfreedom of speech and which countries flout it. Cuba and several countries in\nSoutheast Asia and the Middle East engage in pervasive censorship and are\nmarked in purple. China, for example, has a \"great firewall\" that makes it\ndifficult for its citizens to read about sensitive topics such as the Falun\nGong or the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Other countries have a partially\nfree internet. In Russia, for example, the government has engaged in more\naggressive internet censorship since Vladimir Putin returned to power in 2012.\n\n  22. #### Countries that block social media sites\n\nMother Jones\n\n#### Countries that block social media sites\n\nThe social media sites Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are frequent targets for\ncensorious governments. This map from Mother Jones shows which countries\nrestrict their users from accessing these sites. China doesn't just block\naccess to Western social media sites, it has also cultivated home-grown\nalternatives that are under the thumb of the Chinese authorities. These social\nmedia sites enable users to engage in relatively unfettered discusion, but the\nproviders are required to participate in an elaborate monitoring and\ncensorship regime to ensure that sensitive topics do not receive widespread\ndiscussion.\n\n### The geography of online services\n\n  23. #### Silicon Valley, the capital of the internet\n\nVox\n\n#### Silicon Valley, the capital of the internet\n\nThe privatization of the internet transformed what had been an obscure\nacademic network into a hotbed of commercial innovation. In the late 1990s,\nhundreds of new companies sprouted up to take advantage of these\nopportunities. And many of them were clustered in Silicon Valley, a strip of\nland on the peninsula south of San Francisco. In the mid-1990s, Silicon Valley\nwas already home to established technology companies like Intel, Apple, Adobe,\nand Cisco. The dot-com boom brought a new crop of companies, including Yahoo,\neBay, and Google. Since the turn of the century, newer companies such as\nFacebook and Nest have been founded in Silicon Valley too. Mozilla, the non-\nprofit organizaiton behind the popular Firefox browser, is based in Mountain\nView, not far from Google.\n\n  24. #### \"Silicon Valley\" is moving downtown\n\nVox\n\n#### \"Silicon Valley\" is moving downtown\n\nWe use \"Silicon Valley\" as a shorthand for the technology companies in the San\nFrancisco Bay Area, but the moniker is becoming increasingly out of date.\nSince 2000, a growing share of internet startups are being formed not in\nsuburbs like Mountain View or Palo Alto but in the heart of San Francisco.\nTwitter, Dropbox, Yelp, and Airbnb are all successful technology companies\nthat have been founded in the last decade. And they're all located within a\ncouple of miles of one another in a San Francisco neighborhood called Soma\n(for South of Market). The non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, founded in 2003 to\nmanage Wikipedia, is also located here. One big reason this neighborhood has\nemerged as San Francisco's innovatin center is its proximity to the Caltrain\nstation at 4th and King Streets. The station provides easy access to the\nventure capitalists and established companies at the other end of the Caltrain\nline in Silicon Valley.\n\n  25. #### Watch Google Chrome take over the web\n\nStatcounter\n\n#### Watch Google Chrome take over the web\n\nFor the first decade of the 21st century, the internet was dominated by\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer. In 2009, the software was the most popular way to\nbrowse the web in most countries, with Firefox popular in some parts of\nEastern Europe and Asia. Since then Google's Chrome browser, which first\nreleased in 2008, has exploded in popularity. It is now the most popular\nbrowser in almost every developed country. On the other hand, in much of sub-\nSaharan Africa, the most popular browser is Opera. This is probably because\nmany people in these countries access the internet using their cell phones,\nand Opera offers a mobile browser that works well on low-end smartphones.\n\n  26. #### Most popular mobile phone brands\n\nStatcounter\n\n#### Most popular mobile phone brands\n\nRight now, three companies dominate the global market for mobile phones, and\nthey've largely divided the market by income. In wealthy countries, Apple's\niPhone is popular. In middle-income countries, especially in Latin America,\nEastern Europe, and the Middle East, Samsung devices have the lead. In poor\ncountries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Nokia often dominates. These data\nare based on web browsing patterns, so it may not be a perfect reflection of\nthe number of units sold by these companies.\n\n  27. #### Watch Facebook take over the internet\n\nVincenzo Consenza\n\n#### Watch Facebook take over the internet\n\nIn 2009, Facebook was already one of the most popular social networks in the\nworld, but over the last five years it has become totally dominant. For\nexample, in 2009 Brazil was dominated by Orkut, a social network created by\nGoogle in 2004. But Facebook surpassed Orkut in Brazil in 2011. One factor in\nFacebook's growing global popularlity is Facebook Zero. Under this program,\nFacebook pays the data charges for users who log into a stripped down version\nof Facebook from their mobile phones. The program has made Facebook accessible\nto millions of users who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it.\n\n  28. #### Here's where your data lives\n\nVox\n\n#### Here's where your data lives\n\nIf you've entrusted your data to Google, Facebook, Yahoo, or Microsoft,\nthere's a good chance it's stored at a location marked by one of these pins.\nSmaller web companies store their servers in data centers managed by third\nparties, but the internet's largest companies have their own dedicated data\ncenters with hundreds of thousands of servers in them. These data centers are\nlocated around the world. That has two advantages. First, locating data\ncenters close to users allows data to be delivered more quickly. Second, it\nhelps provide redundancy: if user data is kept in multiple locaitons, it will\nbe safe even in the event of a catastrophic failure at one data center. On\nthis map, Google data centers are red, Microsoft data centers are yellow,\nYahoo data centers are purple, and Facebook data centers are blue. This is not\nan exhaustive list of these companies' facilities. All of these companies are\nsecretive about their operational details, and so some of the companies' data\ncenter locations haven't been publicly disclosed.\n\n  29. #### Data centers in the United States\n\nVox\n\n#### Data centers in the United States\n\nThe biggest internet companies have data centers around the world, but a\ndisproportionate share of their data centers are located in the United States.\nAnd American data centers are clustered in a few states, notably Oregon, Iowa,\nand the Carolinas. These states have several important advantages. One is\ncheap power. For example, Oregon has cheap hydroelectric power that has\nattracted several companies to Oregon. Iowa and North Carolina also offer\naffordable electricity. Tax breaks play a role as well; Iowa recently lured a\nbillion-dollar Microsoft data center by offering $20 million in tax\nincentives.\n\n### How America gets online\n\n  30. #### Broadband penetration in the United States\n\nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration, Department of\nCommerce\n\n#### Broadband penetration in the United States\n\nThis map shows what percentage of American homes had broadband internet access\nin 2011. Broadband penetration in the US is heavily linked to geography. The\nWest, Northeast, and upper midwest have the highest broadband adoption, while\nhigh-speed internet access is less common in the south.\n\n  31. #### Broadband isn't available everywhere\n\nFederal Communications Commission\n\n#### Broadband isn't available everywhere\n\nOne reason for the low levels of broadband subscription in some parts of the\nUnited States is availability. At the end of 2011, there were still\nsignificant parts of the country where fixed broadband service wasn't offered.\nSatellite internet service is available almost everyone in the United States,\nbut it tends to be a lot more expensive than fixed broadband connections. And\nthe long delays in satellite communications make it unsuitable for interactive\napplications such as video games and voice calls. Note that the data on this\nmap should be taken with a grain of salt. It's the best data we have\navailable, but it's based on self-reported data from ISPs that isn't always\naccurate.\n\n  32. #### Most popular ISPs in the US\n\nWebpageFX\n\n#### Most popular ISPs in the US\n\nInternet access in the United States is dominated by two big telephone\ncompanies \u2014 AT&T and Verizon \u2014 and two big cable companies \u2014 Comcast and Time\nWarner Cable. Together, those four companies account for more than two thirds\nof all residential internet subscriptions in the United States. Cable\ncompanies account for almost 60 percent of subscriptions, with telephone\ncompanies accounting for most of the remainder. These statistics actually\noverstate the amount of broadband competition in the United States, because\nalthough there are about a dozen ISPs with at least a million subscribers,\nmost households don't have more than two options for high-speed residential\ninternet access: a local cable monopoly and a local phone monopoly. Cable\ncompanies generally don't try to enter areas already served by other cable\ncompanies, nor do telephone companies try to poach customers from other\ntelephone providers.\n\n  33. #### Google Fiber cities\n\nGoogle\n\n#### Google Fiber cities\n\nFor the most part, the broadband market is dominated by the same phone and\ncable companies that have dominated telecommunications for decades. But one\nbig addition to the broadband market is Google, which launched a fiber optic\nnetwork in Kansas City in 2012. Since then, the search giant has added\nnetworks in Austin, TX, and Provo, UT. And Google is considering expanding\ninto about 10 other metro areas in the American south and west.\n\n  34. #### Municipal fiber networks\n\nInstitute for Local Self-Reliance\n\n#### Municipal fiber networks\n\nFrustrated with poor service offered by incumbent broadband providers, about\n400 municipalities across the country have built their own government-owned\nbroadband networks. While 400 might seem like a big number, most of these\ntowns are quite small. The largest, Chattanooga, TN, only has about 170,000\nresidents, and some have as few as 200. So those 400 towns account for a tiny\nfraction of the US population. Some of these networks are extremely fast. For\nexample, residents of Chattanooga can get a 1000 Mbps connection \u2014 about 50\ntimes faster than a typical connection elsewhere in the country \u2014 for $70 per\nmonth. Click for an interactive version of the map.\n\n  35. #### Where municipal fiber is restricted\n\nInstitute for Local Self-Reliance\n\n#### Where municipal fiber is restricted\n\nIncumbent broadband providers have reacted to the municipal broadband trend by\narguing that it's not fair for governments to compete with the private sector.\nIn 19 states, state legislatures have responded with legislation restricting\nmunicipalities from building their own broadband networks. That has taken some\nof the wind out of the sails of the municipal broadband movement, but new\nmunicipal networks keep popping up in states where the law allows them.\n\n### How we use the internet\n\n  36. #### Twerking vs. Syria\n\nFloatingSheep.org\n\n#### Twerking vs. Syria\n\nSocial media sites like Twitter enable a lot of public discussion of the\nimportant issues of the day. But they also enable an even larger quantity of\nfrivolous conversation. Last September was a good example. The nation was\ndiscussing two big topics: possible US involvement in a the war in Syria and\nMiley Cyrus's scandalous dance moves. In Washington DC, Syria conversations on\nTwitter were way more common than twerking conversations. But twerking was a\nmore popular subject in most other states.\n\n  37. #### Watch people wake up on Twitter\n\n#### Watch people wake up on Twitter\n\nOne of the amazing things about the internet is the way it permits the\ncollection and aggregation of large-scale data about human behavior. For\nexample, this map shows where people are tweeting about sunrises over the\ncourse of a 24-hour period. There's a yellow flash of sunrise tweets whenever\nthe sun rises above the horizon in a part of the world. You can see an\ninteractive version of this map here.\n\n  38. #### Porn consumption by state\n\nPornhub\n\n#### Porn consumption by state\n\nViewing pornography is one of the most popular uses of the internet. This map\nshows data from the popular porn site Pornhub. The data suggest that liberal\nstates such as Illinois and Massachusetts are the heaviest pornography\nconsumers, while conservative states such as Idaho and South Dakota consume\nthe least pornography. The average Massachusetts resident is responsible for\nalmost twice as many pageviews per capita as the average Idaho resident. (I've\nomitted Kansas due to a methodological problem with Pornhub's data.)\n\n  39. #### What Wikipedia knows\n\nOxford Internet Institute\n\n#### What Wikipedia knows\n\nWikipedia is a global online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and it has\neditions in more than 280 languages. Many articles are \"geotagged\" with a\nphysical location. Researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute plotted these\npoints on a map, providing a beautiful map of the locations that are subjects\nof Wikipedia articles. Unsurprisingly, Wikipedia contributors writing in\ndifferent languages focus on different parts of the world. Most of the yellow\ndots from the Persian edition of Wikipedia are in or near Iran. French\nWikipedia has more information about continental Europe while English\nWikipedia dominates English-speaking countries. The density of information\nreflected by this map is amazing. Wikipedia has articles about almost every\npart of the Earth that's inhabited by human beings, and this map would likely\nbe even denser if it included other major languages such as Spanish, Russian,\nand Chinese.\n\n  40. #### Languages of the world according to Twitter\n\nEric Fischer\n\n#### Languages of the world according to Twitter\n\nHere's another map showing which languages people around the world use online.\nEach dot on the map represents a cluster of tweets, and the color represents\nthe language spoken in those tweets. English is ubiquitous online, so Fischer\nchose a neutral grey color for it so it wouldn't overpower the other colors.\nFischer didn't explicitly label the countries on the map, but it's still easy\nto see national borders. You can also seem significant linguistic minorities.\nFor example, if you click the link for the full map, you can see where people\nspeak French in Canada.\n\n### Learn more\n\n  * 40 maps that explain the Middle East\n\n  * The new battle for the future of the internet\n\n  * Everything you need to know about the internet\n\nBack to top\n\n### Credits\n\n  * Editor Eleanor Barkhorn\n  * Designer Uy Tieu\n\n  * Developer Yuri Victor\n\n", "frontpage": false}
