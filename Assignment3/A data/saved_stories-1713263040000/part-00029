Musk claimed that this change was real and explained his\nreasoning. \u201cUnfortunately, a small fee for new user write access is the only\nway to curb the relentless onslaught of bots,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nElon Really Wants to Turn Twitter Into Wall Street\n\nElon Musk's Plan to Hide Like Counts and Retweets Is Going to Make Twitter\nBoring as Hell\n\nThe Elon Musk Twitter Saga, Part 1 of Who Knows?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Elon Musk Twitter Saga, Part 1 of Who Knows?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk went on to say in another tweet that new users would only have to put up\nwith the fee for three months and write access would be free from there on.\nThis makes things a bit confusing since the fee is annual, not monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tactic by X has already been tested. Back in October, the social media\nplatform tried out charging the $1 fee for new accounts that were opened in\nNew Zealand and the Philippines.\n\nIt appears that Musk\u2014who wants to be perceived as living on the edge of the\nfuture with his Cybertruck, AI, and robots\u2014can\u2019t wrap his head around stopping\nbots on X. One of the big reasons why X began a $8 monthly subscription was to\nstop bots from taking over the platform. Instead, fraudsters found them\nbeneficial and made use of verified bot accounts in their scams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter in 2022, the platform has been riddled with\nissues. From scammers deceiving the platform to creating seemingly legit links\nthat send those who click to scam sites by automatically changing Twitter URLs\nto X.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
