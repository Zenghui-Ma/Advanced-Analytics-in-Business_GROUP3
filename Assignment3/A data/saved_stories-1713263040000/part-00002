Calm under the barrage, he repeatedly denied any wrongdoing\nand reiterated that the social media service had cut most of its connections\nto ByteDance, its Chinese parent.\n\nBut with the House voting in March to force ByteDance to sell its stake in\nTikTok, 11 former employees interviewed by Fortune tell a vastly different\nstory. Many of those ex-workers, four of whom were employed as recently as\nlast year, say at least some of TikTok\u2019s operations were intertwined with its\nparent during their tenures, and that the company\u2019s independence from China\nwas largely cosmetic. A few of the former workers would only speak to Fortune\non the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by TikTok, including the\ncompany seizing restricted stock they were given while still employees.\n\nThe allegations of close ties, made in interviews between August and April,\nraise more questions about the relationship between TikTok and ByteDance. They\nalso create more fodder for critics who fear the Chinese government could use\nTikTok as a sort of Trojan horse to spy on Americans by sifting through the\nhuge amounts of digital data that it collects.\n\nEvan Turner, who worked at TikTok as a senior data scientist from April to\nSeptember in 2022, said TikTok concealed the involvement of its Chinese owner\nduring his employment. When hired, Turner initially reported to a ByteDance\nexecutive in Beijing. But later that year, after the company announced a major\ninitiative to store TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data only in the U.S., Turner was\nreassigned\u2014on paper, at least\u2014to an American manager in Seattle, he says. But\nTurner says a human resources representative revealed during a video\nconference call that he would, in reality, continue to work with the ByteDance\nexecutive. The stealth chain of command contradicted what TikTok\u2019s executives\nhad said about the company\u2019s independence from ByteDance, Turner says.\n\nTurner says he never met with the Seattle-based manager. Instead, Turner had\nweekly check-ins lasting less than seven minutes with the Beijing-based\nByteDance executive. In these meetings, Turner says he merely told the\nexecutive how far along he was in completing assigned tasks\u2014and nothing else.\n\nNearly every 14 days, as part of Turner\u2019s job throughout 2022, he emailed\nspreadsheets filled with data for hundreds of thousands of U.S. users to\nByteDance workers in Beijing. That data included names, email addresses, IP\naddresses, and geographic and demographic information of TikTok U.S. users, he\nsays. The goal was to sift through the information to mine for insights like\nthe geographical regions where users watched the most videos of a particular\ngenre and decide how the company should invest to encourage users to be more\nactive. It all took place after the company had started its initiative to keep\nsensitive U.S. user data in the U.S., and only available to U.S. workers.\n\n\u201cI literally worked on a project that gave U.S. data to China,\u201d Turner says.\n\u201cThey were completely complicit in that. There were Americans that were\nworking in upper management that were completely complicit in this.\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s project to stop sharing user data with ByteDance was part of an\neffort to fend off regulators. The initiative, called Project Texas, started\nin early 2022 after President Trump tried to ban TikTok, citing its national\nsecurity threat, followed by President Biden banning the service on federal\ndevices and raising concerns about its Beijing-based parent. As part of the\n$1.5 billion Project Texas, TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation moved its U.S. user data\nto U.S.-based data centers, according to TikTok\u2019s Project Texas website. The\ncompany also created a new team to manage all business functions requiring\nsensitive user data, among other security measures.\n\nTwo years later, TikTok remains in the crosshairs. On March 13 the full House\nof Representatives voted 352\u201365 to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold the app to\na non-Chinese company. President Biden said he would sign the bill, but the\nSenate has yet to decide its next step.\n\nCybersecurity experts differ on the significance of TikTok\u2019s alleged data\nsharing.\n\nAnton Dahbura, executive director of Johns Hopkins Information Security\nInstitute and also codirector of the school\u2019s Institute for Assured Autonomy,\nsays the alleged transfer of data to China in the incidents described by\nTurner is \u201cvery concerning.\u201d \u201cEven though a spreadsheet is probably a very\ntiny percentage of all of the information that TikTok collects, it can be\nextremely targeted and very damaging to certain people,\u201d he says. Dahbura\npointed out that geographic data can be used for phishing attacks. \u201cEveryone\nshould be really concerned,\u201d he says.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia Tech cybersecurity and privacy professor Jon Lindsay chalks\nTurner\u2019s story of sending U.S. user data to Chinese colleagues via email up to\ngrowing pains, and therefore far less serious. \u201cCompanies are companies, and\nbig bureaucracies are big bureaucracies; they\u2019re stupid and silly and do all\nkinds of crazy things\u2014it\u2019s hard to change your own habits,\u201d says Lindsay, who\nhas written two books on information technology and national defense. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re moving things to a new place, and your friends with expertise are in\nother places, then, yes, you\u2019re occasionally going to be sending them things\nbecause, maybe, they can do things you can\u2019t do or you haven\u2019t hired the right\npeople or you left some machines there.\u201d\n\n## Who\u2019s lurking on Lark?\n\nIn another example of potential data sharing between TikTok and ByteDance,\nPatrick Spaulding Ryan, who was TikTok\u2019s lead technical program manager for\nsecurity engineering until 2022, and another former TikTok U.S.-based\nemployee, cited some of the company\u2019s internal software systems that they said\nwere maintained and monitored by China-based ByteDance teams. Lark, a Slack-\nlike internal messaging system that ByteDance and TikTok share, is among the\nmost important shared software systems used by the two businesses, say the\nformer employees. Because Lark is run by ByteDance, ByteDance workers could\nsee discussions by TikTok employees, including ones about U.S. user data.\n\nNnete Matima, who worked in business development at both TikTok and ByteDance\nin the U.S., sold Lark to corporate customers from July 2022 to August 2023.\nIn her sales conversations, prospective customers would ask Matima where Lark\nstored data that users posted on the platform. In trying to find out the\nanswer, Matima said she spent significant time getting the \u201crunaround\u201d and\nnever received a firm answer from TikTok and ByteDance management. \u201cYou could\nnever really get any straight answers that could be solid enough to bring back\nto your client to basically let them know that this is a trustworthy platform,\nand that their American data is safe,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey are not transparent\nto the point where I had to lose a deal because I couldn\u2019t answer basic\nsecurity questions that people are entitled to.\u201d\n\nMatima, who is Black, was fired from the company in August 2023. In her\ntelling, the company terminated her employment because of performance issues,\nbut she believes she was fired in retaliation for voicing her concerns about\nalleged racist treatment she endured during her tenure at TikTok, according to\na complaint she filed after her dismissal with the Fair Employment Practices\nAgencies and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Matima says she has\nalready spoken to an EEOC investigator about the complaint.\n\nLast year, the New York Times reported about Lark storing critical data in\nChina. The company did not respond to the Times\u2019 questions about whether Lark\ndata was stored in China and declined to answer questions about China-based\nworkers sharing TikTok user data on Lark. It did say, however, that many Lark\nchat groups were shut down \u201cafter the service had reviewed \u2018internal\nconcerns.\u2019\u201d\n\nJacob Wallach, who worked at the company from June 2020 until August 2022 on\nthe company\u2019s global business solutions team managing relationships with\nenterprise clients, was unconcerned by ByteDance\u2019s presence and oversight of\nLark. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable that Chinese workers had access...it\u2019s like\nwith any global entity,\u201d he says. Wallach believes the possibility for\nsurveillance by his former employer was equal to those of other companies he\u2019s\nworked for in the U.S. He noted the infrequent interactions he had with\nBeijing-based counterparts and said that a requirement that TikTok be sold, as\nthe House recently endorsed, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nAnother service TikTok and ByteDance share is Seal, an authenticator app and\nVPN network that employees were required to download on their work phones to\nprotect their identities, data, and systems from potential risks. Often those\nphones were personal devices because the company did not provide phones to\nemployees, according to Ryan, who says he led the company\u2019s core TikTok app\nsecurity team until his departure in 2022. The software gave ByteDance a\nfoothold on the personal devices of U.S. employees, which made them vulnerable\nto surveillance by Beijing-based ByteDance employees, says Ryan.\n\nSeal, which was intended for managing mobile devices, remained \u201ccompletely\nunknown to [TikTok U.S.] employees,\u201d says Ryan, making the point that no one\nknew how it worked. Members of the App Security R&D team, TikTok\u2019s core app\nsecurity unit, were unable to test the technology, he adds. Ryan, who owns\ntens of thousands of TikTok shares, has filed a complaint with the National\nLabor Relations Board that alleges the company\u2019s non-disparagement clause in\nits shareholder agreement violates employees\u2019 right to unionize, constituting\nan unfair labor practice.\n\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Lindsay describes the ex-employees\u2019 concerns about Seal and\nLark as \u201cparanoia.\u201d He believes any spying by China-based workers via Lark and\nSeal would be highly unlikely because it would compromise ByteDance\u2019s entire\nenterprise business of selling the software, which ByteDance reportedly hoped\nwould hit $940 million in global revenue by 2026. \u201cThere is tremendous risk\ninvolved when you\u2019re talking about putting generic backdoors in mass-produced\ncommodities because the likelihood of [the backdoors] becoming discovered,\ncompromised, and mitigated is so high\u2014and then losing a massive amount of\nmarket share because of that one decision, which provides nothing to the\ncompany and very tenuous intelligence benefits to the State,\u201d Lindsay says.\n\nIn contrast, Johns Hopkins\u2019 Dahbura thinks the ties are evidence that\n\u201cByteDance and their Chinese government associates haven\u2019t been trying very\nhard to create a true firewall between their Chinese operation and their U.S.\noperation.\u201d He says the former employees\u2019 allegations about Lark\u2019s China\nconnection is \u201cunsurprising.\u201d\n\nIn late March, Politico reported that the Federal Trade Commission had been\ninvestigating TikTok over alleged \u201cfaulty data and data security practices.\u201d\nPolitico\u2019s source says the FTC was investigating allegations that the company\ndeceived users by denying China had access to their data and violating a\nchildren\u2019s privacy law. The agency could either proceed with a settlement or\ntake the company to court, in partnership with the Department of Justice.\nSpokespeople for the FTC, DOJ, and TikTok declined to comment about Politico\u2019s\nstory.\n\nNot all former employees are critical of the effort by TikTok and ByteDance to\nseparate their collection of user data. Another ex-TikTok manager, who started\nat the company in 2020 and left recently, said that TikTok has made progress\nin separating user data originally shared between the two. He says that\nProject Clover, the European Union\u2019s Project Texas equivalent, as well as\nProject Texas, have made a \u201csignificant difference\u201d in securing the data of\nEuropean and U.S. users. \u201cWhen I joined there was less of a delineation\nbetween TikTok and the parent company. Now there\u2019s been a lot of work done to\ndelineate it...I can\u2019t speak to leadership decisions, but in terms of the\ntechnology stack, there\u2019s been a lot done to delineate them.\u201d\n\nWallach, the former TikTok global sales manager, also dismissed the criticism\naround TikTok\u2019s data practices. He argued that TikTok is facing undue\ncriticism as a result of its Chinese parent and U.S. popularity. Wallach, who\nhas worked at tech and consulting companies and was at TikTok for over two\nyears, says that the data collection practices of Meta, Google, and Amazon are\nfar more concerning. \u201cTikTok has had to do things to the 10th or 11th degree\ncompared to what Meta or Google has had to do\u2014solely because they\u2019re owned by\na Chinese company,\u201d he says.\n\nTikTok ignored a detailed list of questions sent by Fortune about the\nallegations by its former employees. Rather, a TikTok spokesperson responded:\n\u201cThese are completely unfounded assertions brought forth by disgruntled ex-\nemployees. It is incredible that Fortune would solely rely on individuals with\nclear motives and agendas to spread anonymous lies and distortions.\u201d\n\nFour of the ex-employees interviewed by Fortune were fired from the company,\nwhile the other seven exited voluntarily from 2021 through 2023. Four of those\ninterviewed have filed complaints with government agencies related to their\ntreatment as TikTok employees and shareholders. Matima and J\u00f6el Carter, a\nformer ad policy manager, filed a joint complaint with the EEOC. A third\nemployee complained to the National Labor Relations Board and Internal Revenue\nService. The fourth filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\n\nIn public, TikTok executives are adamant that TikTok has changed its practices\ninvolving ByteDance. In an internal memo from December viewed by the Wall\nStreet Journal, the company told workers it planned to provide Project Texas\nemployees with new tools and devices for sharing data and communicating with\none another after employees voiced concern about ByteDance potentially\naccessing their ByteDance-owned hardware and software.\n\nIn January of this year and March 2023, TikTok CEO Chew reiterated before\nCongress that the company is independent. He emphasized that three of\nByteDance\u2019s five board members are American (the other two are Chinese), and\nthat the service has spent the last two years building a \u201cfirewall\u201d that seals\n\u201cprotected U.S. user data from unauthorized foreign access,\u201d referring to\nProject Texas. \u201cThe bottom line is this American data is stored on American\nsoil by an American company overseen by American personnel,\u201d he said during\nlast year\u2019s testimony.\n\n## TikTok is working hard to maintain its image of independence\n\nKatie Puris, TikTok\u2019s former head of global business marketing, sued the\ncompany in February for discrimination, saying that her Beijing-based bosses\nexpected her to be demure, and that it led to her firing in the fall of 2022.\nIn her complaint, she also revealed details about the alleged involvement of\nByteDance in TikTok\u2019s business.\n\nBeginning in 2020, Puris said in her complaint, filed in the U.S. District\nCourt in New York\u2019s Southern District, that ByteDance executives began\nasserting more control over TikTok\u2019s day-to-day operations, counter to what\nTikTok said in public. They did so by organizing bimonthly meetings led by\nByteDance chairman Lidong Zhang so that executives like Puris could talk about\ntheir achievements and form plans for the following two months with top\nofficers at ByteDance. \u201cDespite its attempts to appear independent, TikTok\u2019s\nday-to-day management and business decisions came directly from ByteDance\u2019s\ntop-level management in China,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThrough her attorney, Puris did not respond to requests to be interviewed by\nFortune. TikTok has not commented on the lawsuit.\n\nThe involvement of ByteDance in TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations has been documented\nin a number of other publications. Last year, a worker at ByteDance in China\ntold the Wall Street Journal that the Chinese government had accessed TikTok\nuser data in 2018 to spy on Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters, including\ntheir network information, SIM card IDs, and IP addresses. A TikTok\nspokeswoman told the Journal these allegations were \u201cbaseless claims\u201d by an\nemployee who had not spoken out in the five years following his 2018\ntermination and was now suing the company to \u201cgarner media attention.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, Buzzfeed News reported that ByteDance employees in\nChina repeatedly accessed U.S. user data. A TikTok spokesperson denied the\nallegation to BuzzFeed, saying, \u201cWe aim to remove any doubt about the security\nof U.S. user data\u201d and \u201ccontinually work to validate\u201d security standards by\nbringing in \u201creputable, independent third parties to test [its] defenses.\u201d\n\nForbes also found that ByteDance and TikTok staff, including personnel in\nChina, have access to top politicians\u2019 and celebrities\u2019 closest contacts on\nthe app and that TikTok stored data in China of many top global users. In\nresponse, a TikTok spokesperson told Forbes it was impossible to answer the\npublication\u2019s questions without the name of the \u201cspecific tool in question\u201d\nand stated it remained \u201cconfident in the accuracy\u201d of CEO Chew\u2019s March\ncongressional testimony. During the testimony, Chew said the \u201cfirewall\nprotected U.S. data from unwanted foreign access,\u201d noting that once the\ncompany finished deleting legacy data stored on servers in Virginia and\nSingapore, \u201call protected U.S. data will be under the protection of U.S. law\nand under the control of the U.S.-led security team.\u201d\n\nTikTok has tried to mitigate any damage caused by workers talking to reporters\nabout China. One ex-TikTok worker who left in 2021, for instance, says TikTok\ngave him talking points to help deny links to China, if asked about the topic.\n\nExternal criticism about China was a big topic inside the company, too. Yet\nanother former senior employee, who left in 2022, recalls having to assuage\nfears internally across TikTok\u2019s entire workforce about its dependence on\nByteDance. \u201cI would say things that just weren\u2019t the case,\u201d she says,\nadmitting that she felt it was part of her job to downplay to colleagues the\nties with ByteDance. \u201cIt undermined my credibility with the company, with the\nemployees I was friends with, and everything else.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
