Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007.\n\nBut I\u2019m talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational\nproduct that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they\nneed to be.\n\nToday, I\u2019d like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary\nproduct and the world\u2019s first practical vehicle navigation system.\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of it:\n\nAt the time, it was considered out-of-this-world. This is what Silicon\nValley\u2019s San Jose Mercury News said about it:\n\nThe Etak Navigator launched 39 years (!) ago in 1985.\n\nBack then Reagan and Gorbachev were negotiating the end of the cold war.\n\nAnd it was the year Steven Spielberg released the film \u201cBack to the Future\u201d...\n\nCredit: Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis and Universal Pictures\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure at that time many of you were but a twinkle in your mother\u2019s\neye...\n\nBack in 1985 you used paper maps to navigate, like this one from a Thomas\nBrother\u2019s map of Los Angeles:\n\nAs you can see, the maps weren\u2019t always pretty. By today\u2019s standards it was\nalso supremely difficult and tedious to find locations and even more difficult\nto work out how to get there.\n\nSo, when the Etak Navigator launched, it was like something from the future.\n\nIt immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular\nScience:\n\nNearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch.\n\nMost important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back\nin 1985 GPS was not available (see \u201c12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World:\nPart 8 \u2014 Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201c)\n\nBefore GPS, navigation systems used a technique called \u2018dead reckoning\u2018. Dead\nreckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of\ntravel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the\ngreater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are.\n\nTo solve this problem Etak invented \u2018augmented dead reckoning\u2019. This used a\nprocess to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a\ntopologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the\nassumption that you\u2019re driving on a road. At that point the location could be\n\u2018snapped\u2019 back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This\ntechnique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today.\n\nLike all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key\ninvention the Etak Navigator would have failed.\n\nThe second key invention was a \u2018heading up\u2019, moving map display. This meant\nthat the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and\nturned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what\nwas displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive.\n\nThird: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the\nconcept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call\n\u2018geocoding\u2019.\n\nHere is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in\naction:\n\nAs you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives.\n\nThe buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number\nof miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen.\n\nThe top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the\ndestination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and\nwhich way is north.\n\nThe address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or\nintersection. You could also store common locations like home and work.\n\nThe Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen.\n\nThese were soft programmed depending on the current function.\n\nIn the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any\nletter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you\nonly had to enter the first few letters of a street name:\n\nAnd after that you simply selected the street from a list:\n\nThis is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode:\n\nNote that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead\nyou simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing\nstar. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the\nlocal roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate\nroad to take.\n\nThe lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from\nmuch personal experience that the system worked very well!\n\n## Etak Navigator System Details\n\nThere were five key components to the Etak Navigator:\n\nThe first was a vector CRT display \u2014 similar to what you might find in an\noscilloscope.\n\nThe navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape\ndrive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music\nplayer a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8\u2032\u2032) per second. The\ncassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80\u2032\u2032) per second!\n\nThere was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle.\n\nTo determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the\ncompass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the\nvehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the\nwheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers.\n\nFinally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the\nCPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk.\n\nThe cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps\nwere called \u201cEtak Maps\u201d. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area:\n\nThe original price for the Etak Navigator was US$1,395:\n\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of about US$4,000 today.\n\nOn top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost:\nit took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system.\n\n## Just Some of the Technical Hurdles\n\nBack in 1985 there were huge technical constraints.\n\nGPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the\nmilitary getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both\nlarge and expensive.\n\nIn addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks\ncouldn\u2019t store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too\ncostly.\n\nThe most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error\nfrom the wheel sensors and the compass.\n\nHere the solution was topological map matching.\n\nThis invention, above all others, made the product viable.\n\nAnother issue was data storage and latency.\n\nThe cassette tapes only held 3.5 megabytes and had 10 second average seek\ntimes.\n\nThe dev team had to invent a way of storing the 2D map on a one dimensional\nmedium, making sure that regions close by on the map were also close by on the\ntape.\n\nYears later, when hard drives became cheaper and CD-ROMs became more readily\navailable Etak\u2019s highly efficient map data storage algorithm paid off in\nspades and resulted in very high performance maps.\n\nAnother problem was heat.\n\nUsers commonly left tapes on their dashboards and obviously dashboards can get\nvery, very hot.\n\nYou can see from the tests that not all brands of cassette tape did very well:\n\nHowever, a brand that worked was finally found. It had a shell made of\npolycarbonate.\n\nYet another problem was dealing with inclines.\n\nThe map had no elevation information and so if you were traveling up or down a\nhill errors would be compounded in the system as the distance traveled on the\nroad was not equal to the distance traveled on the map.\n\nTo compensate we therefore needed to know the slope of the hill. To compute\nthis Etak\u2019s lead hardware engineer invented a special inclinometer that used\nfluid and a capacitive sensor. In tests on various fluids he found that\nTequila worked quite well!\n\nAnother problem were magnetic anomalies.\n\nBridges can be highly magnetic and can really throw off a compass.\n\nThe positioning algorithm therefore had to recognize these anomalies. When an\nanomaly was detected the positioning instead relied on the different speeds of\nthe wheels to determine changes in direction. It wasn\u2019t quite machine\nlearning, but at the time it seemed pretty close!\n\nThe system also had to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the\nrear window defroster.\n\nIn 1985 there wasn\u2019t the luxury of 25 billion transistors and an M3 chip.\n\nInstead the system relied on an Intel 8088 CPU which had 8-bits, ran at 5MHz\nand only had 29,000 transistors.\n\nThus every line of code had to be incredibly efficient. It was all written in\nC, except for key parts of the OS kernel which were written in assembly.\n\nWhat about the digital map?\n\nEtak had to create it \u2014 more or less from scratch.\n\nOriginally Etak thought it could get maps from the government. Back then the\nUS Census Bureau had something called GBF DIME files (which predated TIGER).\nBut they were stick maps and didn\u2019t contain any shape to the roads.\n\nEtak therefore embarked on a massive program to build a map of key\nmetropolitan areas across the US and later in Europe.\n\nTo reposition the GBF/DIME files and give them some shape we used 1:24,000\nscale United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, otherwise knowns as\n\u2018USGS quads\u2019 as a reference.\n\nEach map was photographed onto 10\u201d transparencies and then scanned using a\nvery expensive drum scanner.\n\nThe entire map production program was developed and ran on a single VAX\nminicomputer. This blazing machine had 2MB RAM and two 400MB hard drives. It\ncost about US$120,000 in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nThis little devil was burdened with a mammoth set of tasks. It supported:\n\n  * 4 map digitizing workstations\n  * The engineers developing and compiling code\n  * Batch jobs to process and compile all the map data\n  * The company admins who used it for word processing\n\nThis was the coding environment:\n\nA dumb monochrome terminal.\n\nYou edited code using the \u2018vi\u2019 editor. Sometimes you waited an hour for your\nprograms to compile.\n\nThe jobs to process the map data took up to two weeks to run ... which was\nlonger the the mean time between failure for the VAX mini-computer. The\nengineers used to joke that they should run the long jobs only immediately\nafter a hardware failure had been fixed (knowing full well they were uttering\na statistical fallacy).\n\nThe map digitizing environment was also revolutionary:\n\nEach digitizing workstation was comprised of a PC clone with an 8-bit color\ngraphics card and a 19\u201d monitor. Initially there were four workstations which\nwere manned by three shifts a day. Later this grew to 36 workstations. Etak\ndigitized maps 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8 hours a day on weekends.\n\nThe map editing system was the first ever to use \u2018heads up\u2019 digitizing and was\na huge trade secret at the time. It was so secret that the methodology was\nnever patented and the digitizing environment was walled off from prying eyes\n\u2014 especially from the CEO of a particular company called \u2018Environmental\nSystems Research Institute\u2018 \u2014 i.e. a gentleman called Jack Dangermond who I\u2019m\nsure would have leapt at the chance to borrow the concept.\n\nBefore this invention people used to digitize \u2018blind\u2019 using digitizing tablets\nwhich was highly inefficient and error prone.\n\nEtak\u2019s map production system leveraged the eight bits of the color graphics\ncard very efficiently. 5 bits were used to display the scan of the USGS quad\nin greyscale and the other 3 bits were used to display the digitized map on\ntop. The system was used to reposition the GBF/DIME files as well as to\ndigitize new roads and edit road attributes like street names and addresses:\n\n## The Amazing Team Behind It\n\nEtak was founded in 1983 by a truly amazing engineer, Stan Honey.\n\nStan was already a world renown sailor. More importantly he was a world class\nnavigator and had already beaten many sailing records across the Pacific by\nrelying on his navigation skills.\n\nBefore founding Etak, Stan was a research engineer at SRI International in\nMenlo Park, California.\n\nStan has gone on to do many things. His most recent achievement was as the\ndirector of technology for the America\u2019s Cup sailing races where he developed\na system to track the America\u2019s Cup boats to within 2cm, five times per\nsecond!\n\nThe original idea for Etak came when Stan Honey and a serial entrepreneur,\nNolan Bushnell, were on a sailing boat together. Nolan had hired Stan to\nnavigate his racing yacht through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a\nprestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from\nLos Angeles to Honolulu.\n\nNolan was famous for inventing the first video game, Pong, and later for\nfounding Atari.\n\nThe story is recounted by Benj Edwards in his fantastic article for Fast\nCompany: \u201cWho Needs GPS? The Forgotten Story of Etak\u2019s Amazing 1985 Car\nNavigation System\u201c:\n\n> [Early one morning Stan and Nolan were on night watch together.] They began\n> brainstorming about a computer-based navigation system for use on land. Stan\n> thought a navigation system for automobiles could operate based on dead\n> reckoning and comparing one\u2019s current location to known points on a map, a\n> technique known as map matching. It wouldn\u2019t need satellites at all, just a\n> good digital map, a good compass, and some sensors. Then it could display\n> the result on an electronic screen.\n>\n> Nolan reaction: \u201cYeah, let\u2019s do that and I\u2019ll fund it\u201d\n\nNolan always had an appreciation for where consumer technology might\neventually go. In an interview for Inc. magazine in 1984 he said \u201cLet\u2019s say\nyou\u2019re in your car, and you want to go to dinner. You\u2019ve got this box on the\ndash. You punch in \u2018Japanese,\u2019 then \u2018cheap,\u2019 then \u2018good sushi.\u2019 The box takes\nover and guides you to a place.\u201d\n\nOne of Etak\u2019s key hires was Marv White. Marv was a map scientist and\nmathematician and worked at the US Census Bureau on their mapping program.\n\nUnder Marv\u2019s direction Etak\u2019s map digitizing productivity was three times the\nindustry standard. Since leaving Etak, Marv has gone on to many exciting\nventures, including a period as Chief Technologist for Innovation at ESPN.\n\nThere were many other supremely talented engineers behind the Navigator, many\nof whom previously worked at SRI International: Ken Milnes, George Loughmiller\nand Alan Philips to name a few.\n\nMany of the original hires at Etak went on to other mapping organizations,\nincluding yours truly. When I worked on the Apple Maps team, 12 of my\ncolleagues were Etak alumni.\n\nEtak Staff in 1993: Terry O\u2019Brien, Marv White, Walt Zavoli, Alan Philips,\nJamie Buxton, Ken Milnes, Stan Honey, Gerry Russell\n\n## So What Happened to Etak?\n\nThe Etak Navigator was about 20 years ahead of its time. Due to the cost of\nthe hardware and the expensive installation process building a sustainable\nbusiness proved to be very difficult (sound familiar?)\n\nInstead Etak quickly pivoted. It licensed the navigation code to the biggest\nautomotive OEM hardware manufacturers at the time: Robert Bosch in Germany, GM\nin the USA and Clarion in Japan. In turn these companies developed their own\nnavigation systems and, many years later, the concept of a \u2018Personal\nNavigation Device\u2019 from the likes of Blaupunkt, Garmin, Magellan, TomTom and\nmany others was born.\n\nDuring the course of doing business Etak attracted the attention of a perhaps\nan unusual suitor: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. It was News Corps\u2019 John\nB. Evans that saw the potential.\n\nLike Nolan Bushnell, John was a supreme visionary. You would often find him on\nthe same platforms as Intel\u2019s Andy Grove, Bill Gates and other technology\nmegastars. Albert Scardino and Matt Falloon recount the story in John\u2019s\nobituary in the Guardian:\n\n> The defining deal of [John\u2019s] career came in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Murdoch\n> invested $350m in a group of travel publications and directories. With one\n> hand, Evans took over the consumer magazine division of Murdoch\u2019s US\n> organisation, including TV Guide, Elle and one he himself invented,\n> Automobile. With his other hand, he launched a secret project in a suburban\n> office building to develop a part of the travel group, the Hotel and Travel\n> Index, into a new media product, codenamed Jaguar.\n>\n> In the days before streaming video and large file capacity on the internet,\n> travellers\u2019 views of their hotels and destinations were limited to tourist\n> brochures. Jaguar allowed an electronic visual tour of destinations,\n> complete with views of the hotel room they had booked. Once integrated with\n> major airline booking information and other databases and cross-referencing\n> tools, the system threatened to leapfrog other airline, car and hotel\n> reservation systems.\n\nIt was thus that John had the vision to use Etak\u2019s maps and technology to\nbenefit the Jaguar system. Thus John convinced Rupert to buy Etak.\n\nStan Honey recounts the conversations:\n\n> John instantly saw the power of maps in media to change the world of\n> classified ads, yellow pages, travel, and broadly answer the questions of\n> \u201cwhere is the nearest?\u201d and \u201chow do I get to it?\u201d. Naturally, John and my\n> shared sailing background created an instant group of common friends and\n> experience. I remained close friends with John until he passed away and\n> visited him often. Long after John had left News Corp, whenever I was tee\u2019d\n> up in New York waiting for a weather window for a Transatlantic record\n> attempt under sail, I\u2019d always invite John to come visit the boat, which he\n> found fascinating as the boats were 100 foot monohulls or multihulls. I\n> doubt that Etak would have ever appeared on Murdoch\u2019s radar screen without\n> John Evans\u2019 vision and commitment to his vision, and to Etak. At the time of\n> his decision to buy Etak, Murdoch also asked Barry Diller, who was then\n> running Fox, for his opinion. Barry Diller was hard-nosed and direct in his\n> questions, and had a slightly shorter term vision than did John, but Barry\n> also supported News Corp\u2019s acquisition of Etak, and focus on the maps.\n>\n> John really was a long-term visionary, as was Nolan Bushnell. During the\n> Etak days, both would visit and \u201cwind-up\u201d the Etak crew with their\n> predictions. That was very helpful as the two of them kept our minds wide\n> open. But it was also helpful that they would mostly stay away because we\n> were burdened with the need to actually get things to work, which\n> visionaries seldom are. It is interesting to note that all of the things\n> that Nolan and John predicted, have happened. It is also interesting to\n> remember how far-fetched they seemed at the time of their visits.\n\nBut the times there are a changin\u2019: as fate would have it in 1989 Murdoch sold\nthe Jaguar system to Reed International for a profit of $500M. With Jaguar\nsold the relevance of Etak to New Corp lessened.\n\nNews Corp subsequently sold Etak to SONY, who then later sold it to Tele\nAtlas. And still later Tele Atlas was subsumed by TomTom. So what was\noriginally Etak is now TomTom:\n\n## But Why the name \u2018Etak\u2019?\n\nThe answer goes back to the early days of Polynesian navigation. In those days\nthe ancient mariners navigated the seas by relying on a series of\nenvironmental cues, such as the positions of islands around them.\n\nThey imagined that that their boats were stationary and that the islands moved\npast them.\n\nIn the same way, in the Etak Navigator the vehicle is stationary and it\u2019s the\nmaps that move past the vehicle...\n\nWith that in mind, Stan decided to call his company Etak, which is a\nPolynesian term for moving navigational reference points.\n\n## But Wait, There is One More Thing...\n\nWhen you look at any consumer mapping app in navigation mode, have you noticed\nsomething?\n\nHave you noticed something about the symbol used to denote vehicle location?\n\nDoes it look familiar? Well, of course it does ...\n\nSo it turns out the symbol used by all navigation apps today is the same one\noriginally invented by Etak.\n\nBut why did Etak use that particular symbol?\n\nIf you talk to the engineer who wrote the original code, George Loughmiller,\nhe\u2019ll be meek and tell you that it seemed like a good idea at the time. But\nyou have to remember one thing: Etak was incubated by Nolan Bushnell, founder\nof Atari. And at that time both Etak and Atari were housed in the same office\nbuilding at 1287 Lawrence Station Road in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nBecause Etak used a vector display with limited CPU, George needed a symbol\nthat didn\u2019t burden the very scarce computing resources. He also needed a\nsymbol that was easy to read. A traditional symbol for a car \u2014 \u2014 required too\nmany lines. It also didn\u2019t clearly connote direction. Something simpler was\nneeded.\n\nLegend has it that one of Etak\u2019s engineers got to see a pre-release demo of\none of Atari\u2019s latest games. And that game was...\n\nAnd what symbol did Asteroids use for their spaceship?\n\nAnd thus the symbol for vehicle navigation was born and is still used by all\nnavigation apps globally today:\n\n## So There You Have It...\n\nEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes\neverything.\n\nEtak\u2019s many significant inventions included:\n\n  * the world\u2019s first in-vehicle nav system that actually worked\n  * augmented dead reckoning using map matching\n  * moving map heads up display\n  * first use of geocoding in a consumer application\n  * algorithms for highly efficient map data storage and retrieval\n  * heads up digitizing\n  * the world\u2019s first high volume digital map production system\n  * inventor of the universal map navigation symbol\n\nI was but a pimply engineer at the time. Little did I know when I joined Etak\nin 1985 that I was going to be part of such an illustrious team.\n\nMy hats off and best wishes to everyone I worked with: it was a privilege, an\nhonor and an amazing journey. Thank you.\n\nAcknowledgements, Further Reading & Watching\n\n  * Stan Honey, Marv White and the rest of Etak team\n  * Benj Edwards: \u201cWho Needs GPS?
