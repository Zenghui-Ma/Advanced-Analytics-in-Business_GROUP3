Credit: Debbie\nBragg/Everynight Images via Alamy\n\nNations worldwide are aiming to introduce some of the tightest restrictions\never on smoking and vaping, especially among young people.\n\nOn 16 April, UK lawmakers backed one of the world\u2019s most ambitious plans \u2014 to\ncreate by 2040 a \u2018smoke-free\u2019 generation of people who will never be able to\nlegally buy tobacco. The proposal is now a step closer to becoming law. The\nUK, Australian and French governments are also clamping down on vaping with\ne-cigarettes. These countries\u2019 bold policies are currently in the minority,\nsay researchers, but such measures would almost certainly prevent diseases, as\nwell as save lives and billions of dollars in health-care costs.\n\nSmoking scars the immune system for years after quitting\n\nThe UK plan would probably \u201cbe the most impactful public-health policy ever\nintroduced\u201d, says health-policy researcher Duncan Gillespie at the University\nof Sheffield, UK. The Conservative government\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\ninitiated the proposal. The government hopes that the smoking restrictions,\nalongside offering health benefits for individuals, will reduce toxic\nchemicals leaching from used vapes into the environment.\n\n## Smoke-free generations\n\nThe health harms of smoking tobacco have been established for decades \u2014 it\nsubstantially raises the risk of diseases including cancer, heart disease and\ndiabetes. Increased awareness of these health risks has led to a global\ndecline in the deadly habit in the past few decades (see \u2018Smoke clearing\u2019).\n\nAny drop in smoking rates saves money and reduces the burden on health-care\nsystems, says Alison Commar, who studies tobacco policy at the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO estimates that tobacco use\ncosts the world US$1.4 trillion every year in health expenditures and lost\nproductivity. \u201cEvery tobacco-related illness is adding to the burden on the\nhealth system unnecessarily,\u201d says Commar.\n\nThe UK proposal, announced last October, would ban the sale of tobacco to any\nperson born in or after 2009. That would prevent anyone who turns 15 or\nyounger this year from ever buying cigarettes legally in the country. From\n2027, the minimum legal age to purchase tobacco products would increase from\n18 years old by one year each year \u2014 meaning that the threshold in 2028, for\ninstance, would be 20. This strategy, the government hopes, will by 2040\ncreate a smoke-free generation. The UK move follows similar legislation\nannounced in 2021 by New Zealand. The nation reversed its intended ban because\ntobacco sales were needed to help pay for tax cuts, but the government said\nlast month that it will seek to ban disposable vapes.\n\n## Modelling smokers\n\nThe UK government\u2019s policies are backed by a modelling study published in\nDecember that predicts how the proposal would affect smoking rates and people\nover time. Its \u2018pessimistic\u2019 model predicts that the policy could reduce the\nsmoking rate among people aged 14\u201330 from 13% in 2023 to around 8% in 2030. By\n2040, just 5% of this age group would smoke. In the baseline scenario, 8% of\n14- to 30-year-olds would smoke. In the \u2018optimistic\u2019 scenario, only 0.4% of\nthat age group would start smoking by 2040 (see \u2018Ban plan\u2019). That model\nsuggests that, by 2075, the policy would save tens of thousands of lives and\n\u00a311 billion ($13.7 billion) in health-care costs by preventing smoking-related\ndiseases.\n\nThese projections are based on solid evidence and are of high quality, says\ntobacco researcher Allen Gallagher at the University of Bath, UK.\n\nStill, no country has ever introduced a policy that raises the minimum\ntobacco-purchasing age in this way \u2014 only time will tell what the effects will\nbe, says Commar.\n\n## Vaping bans\n\nNations are also targeting vaping, a trend that began around 2010 and has\nsurged among younger people. Many people have perceived it as a potentially\nhealthier alternative to smoking \u2014 for which there is substantial evidence.\nBut whether vaping itself harms health has long been controversial, and the\nevidence is uncertain.\n\n\u201cThe results are not super clear, but certainly hint towards vaping causing\ndamage to the lungs and other organs,\u201d says Carolyn Baglole, who studies lung\ndisease at the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada.\n\nVapes are made of a box filled with liquid that usually contains nicotine, a\nheating element that turns the liquid into aerosols and a mouthpiece to inhale\nthe aerosol \u2018vape\u2019 clouds, which are often fruity or dessert-flavoured.\nAlthough vapes lack tobacco and most of the toxic chemicals in cigarettes, the\nnicotine is still harmful. Nicotine can raise blood pressure, increase the\nrisk of heart and lung disease and disrupt brain development in children and\nadolescents. In turn, this can lead to impairments in attention, memory and\nlearning.\n\nThe UK plan includes banning disposable vapes, restricting vape flavours that\nappeal to young users and limiting how vapes are advertised. Most young people\nin Great Britain use disposable vapes rather than rechargeable ones than can\nbe refilled with liquid, according to a survey by the public-health charity\nAction on Smoking and Health, based in London. Rechargeable vapes would remain\nlegal.\n\n## Global policies\n\nThe French government also wants to ban disposable vapes this year, and in\nDecember its parliament unanimously backed the proposal. And in 2021,\nAustralia restricted e-cigarette sales to smokers who have a prescription for\nusing vapes to quit smoking. \u201cThere is a good consensus that vaping is likely\nto pose only a small fraction of risks of smoking over the long term,\u201d says\npsychologist Peter Hajek at Queen Mary University of London, who led a study^1\nthat suggested vaping safely helped pregnant women to stop smoking.\n\nBut illegal vaping is still surging among people under the legal age of 18 in\nAustralia, according to research by the Australian Institute of Health and\nWelfare. That\u2019s led the government to tighten rules on vape products. \u201cThis\npolicy push should see the upswing in youth vaping contained and reversed,\u201d\nsays epidemiologist Tony Blakely at the University of Melbourne in Australia.\n\nThe flavoured liquid in vapes also contains solvents such as propylene glycol\nand glycerin. Agencies including the US and European Union drug regulators\nhave approved these chemicals for oral consumption. But animal studies suggest\nthat inhaling them could cause damage and inflammation, raising the risk of\nlung and heart disease^2. \u201cThe issue is we don\u2019t know much about what happens\nwhen you heat these products and aerosolize them for inhalation,\u201d says\nBaglole.\n\nOne thing researchers know is that the heating element in e-cigarettes can\nrelease heavy metals into the inhaled aerosols. These particles have been\nlinked to a raised risk of heart and respiratory disease, she says.\n\nUltimately, scientists seem to be overwhelming in favour of tough restrictions\non smoking and vaping. Research is needed to establish the long-term health\nimpacts of such policies, says Baglole. \u201cHopefully different types of studies,\ndifferent models, in addition to human participants will start to paint a more\ncomplete picture,\u201d she says.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00472-3\n\n### Updates & Corrections\n\n  * Correction 18 April 2024: The graphic \u2018Smoking prevalence\u2019 wrongly coloured the chart lines for the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.
