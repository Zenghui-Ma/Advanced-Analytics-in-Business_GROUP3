Boston Dynamics\nhas a new humanoid robot that the company says represents a path to\ncommercialization. It's the company's next-generation, all-electric \"Atlas\"\nrobot.\n\nWhile new Atlas and old Atlas share a name, they couldn't be more different\nwhen it comes to construction. The old Atlas\u2014a research platform and viral\nsensation that could handle nearly any terrain, do backflips, and pick up\nheavy objects\u2014was powered by a heavy, complicated hydraulics system. The new\nAtlas is all-electric and looks like it's a fraction of the size and weight of\nthe hydraulic version. It also looks like a product, with covers around all\nthe major components and consumer-friendly design touches like a giant status\nlight in the head and a light-up power button that looks like it was ripped\nright from the Spot assembly line.\n\nHydraulic Atlas is being retired to make way for the all-electric version. The\ncompany posted one last goodbye video for the hydraulic model on its YouTube\npage, showing the history of the project. Atlas has done a lot of neat tricks\nover the years, but getting there has required a lot of learning\u2014part of that\nis taking some absolutely gnarly slams, which are highlighted in the video.\nThe video seemed to go out of its way to show just how cumbersome hydraulics\ncan be. At one point, it looks like Atlas' foot completely breaks off, and\nhydraulic fluid gushes all over the floor. Other times, the robot just springs\na leak, and a fine mist of high-pressure fluid sprays everywhere as the robot\ngoes limp. The fluid has a red tinge to it, so with a little imagination, it\ncan look pretty gory!\n\nEnlarge / Old Atlas and the many black hydraulic lines that hang off the\nrobot.\n\nBoston Dynamics\n\nLook at any clear picture of old Atlas, and you will see a constantly wobbling\nhalo of thick, black hydraulic lines hanging all over the robot. Two lines\ncome out of the backpack and form big hoops around the shoulders, running down\nthe arms to the hands. Two more hoses come out of the bottom of the backpack\naround the robot's hips and run down either leg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new Atlas removes that complicated and messy hydraulic system. We only get\na 30-second look at the new robot, but it shows off some impressive\ncapabilities. It seems like a basic thing, but have you ever seen a humanoid\nrobot stand up? Atlas can do it, and probably in the creepiest way possible.\nThe body is lying face down, and the legs swing up into the air, backward, and\nget placed down to the left and right side of the robot's butt in a crazy\ncontortionist's pretzel position. Both feet get placed flat on the floor, and\nthe robot completes the deepest squat you've ever seen, with the hips rotating\nsomething like 270 degrees.\n\nFrom there, the robot's body is facing away from the camera (we're not\nworrying about the head just yet), and then it does the wildest robot turn-\naround you've ever seen. Just below the hip joint, there is another 360 joint\nin the thigh with no human analog, allowing each leg to longitudinally spin\naround. So, without moving the hips or robot body at all, the right leg does a\n180 spin in place and goes from \"knees and toes pointing away from the camera\"\nto \"knees and toes pointing at the camera,\" and then the left leg does the\nsame. Then the whole torso does a 180 and suddenly the robot is facing a\ndifferent direction. It's a zero-radius turnaround, but even that doesn't seem\nlike an adequate description.\n\nBesides it being creepy to see anything move like this, there's a point to the\nmadness. This kind of movement would be impossible with hydraulic lines\nhanging all over the place. Every movement of the old Atlas needed to be made\nwith the limitations of the hydraulic line spaghetti in mind. Move a limb too\nfar, and you will rip a line off and spray fluid everywhere. Just like a\nhuman, every joint had a \"home\" position that you needed to return to, so that\neverything untangled.\n\nThere's no need for any range-of-motion limits with electric joints. While the\nknees of the robot look normal, it looks like the head, torso, hips,\nshoulders, and thigh spinners all look like limitless 360-degree joints. With\nthings like slip rings that can pass electrical wires to a rotating object,\nall these joints can probably just spin forever and have no home position.\nBoston Dynamics is calling the new Atlas the \"world\u2019s most dynamic humanoid\nrobot.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n168\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
