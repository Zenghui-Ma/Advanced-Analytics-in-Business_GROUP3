The first part was\nabout analog computers, then a brief bit about punch-card equipment, then some\nabout real digital computers, in which we prepared a program for the Univac I.\nI was an undergraduate Physics major, but began to intrigued more by both the\ntheory and practice of computing. So in grad school my thesis work was fairly\ntheoretical (hierarchies of recursive functions), but I also began to get more\ninto the practical aspects. I was for three years one of the teaching\nassistants for successive versions of that same introductory course--which by\nthat time had moved to the IBM 7094.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement in the field of computing to\nbe?\n\nDennis Ritchie: The single thing that I'm happiest about is that the notion of\nmaking the Unix system portable was mostly mine. C was already implemented on\nseveral quite different machines and OSs, Unix was already being distributed\non the PDP-11, but the portability of the whole system was new.\n\nAny new accomplishments in sight? What are your current project(s)?\n\nDennis Ritchie: There is no new grand thing to announce--I've been spending\nmore time on history! Over the past several years, I've been more in a\nmanagerial role. The visible things that have come from the group have been\nthe Plan 9 system and Inferno, but I hasten to say that the ideas and the work\nhave come from colleagues. I was more a pay-check signer and giver of talks\nwhen others just wanted to work.\n\nHow much time do you spend programming nowadays?\n\nDennis Ritchie: Little programming as such. I fix things now and then, more\noften tweak HTML and make scripts to do things.\n\nCould you please describe a typical work day at Bell Labs? What software do\nyou use?\n\nDennis Ritchie: I tend to come in late unless there's a meeting, but spend a\nfair amount of time tending to e-mail communication. My own environment (on PC\nhardware) actually runs Windows NT, but it is used mainly as a graphics\nterminal connected to a Plan 9 server, in a way approximately analogous to an\nX windows client. The connection at home is now via cable modem (until last\nsummer ISDN), and Ethernet at the office. Any editing, software work, and mail\nis done in this exported Plan 9. For stuff like getting Excel and Word things,\nplus much WWW browsing, I revert to NT.\n\nDo you have any predictions as to the future of C?\n\nDennis Ritchie: C is declining somewhat in usage compared to C++, and maybe\nJava, but perhaps even more compared to higher-level scripting languages. It's\nstill fairly strong for the basic system-type things.\n\nWhat's your opinion on microkernels vs. monolithic?\n\nDennis Ritchie: They're not all that different when you actually use them.\n\"Micro\" kernels tend to be pretty large these days, and \"monolithic\" with\nloadable device drivers are taking up more of the advantages claimed for\nmicrokernels.\n\nDo you agree with Rob Pike's thoughts on the (ir)relevance of systems\nresearch? (http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/rob/utah2000.ps)\n\nDennis Ritchie: Pretty much, although Rob was stating his case in a\ndeliberately provocative way. It's true that compared with the scene when Unix\nstarted, today the ecological niches are fairly full, and fresh new OS ideas\nare harder to come by, or at least to propagate.\n\nWhat do you think about the development of Linux and the BSD variants? Do you\nthink they'll eventually replace all the proprietary Unix systems?\n\nDennis Ritchie: As a general phenomenon, I think they're great, but they\nsuffer from much the same struggles and competition that the proprietary ones\ndid and do. Sun and HP, SGI , IBM, Digital others all have (or had) variants\nof the same thing-- so too do Linux and the BSDs. Their proprietors may have\ndifferent motivations for producing the variants, of course. And of course\neach does have its own attractions. There is a kind of brand differentiation,\nand this is one of the reasons why portability is hard.\n\nAny thoughts about the GNU project? How did you first learn about it?\n\nDennis Ritchie: I can't remember when I first learned about it, but a long\ntime ago. The True-GNU philosophy is more extreme than I care for, but it\ncertainly laid a foundation for the current scene, as well as providing real\nsoftware. The interesting thing is the way that free-software ideas have begun\nto influence major existing commercial players. At the same time, much of it\nseems to have to do with recreating things we or others had already done; it\nseems rather derivative intellectually; is there a dearth of really new ideas?\nBut still, it's a great satisfaction that so much of it has built on top of a\nbasis we helped to establish.\n\nWho are some of the people that you admire? (in the computer world or\notherwise)\n\nDennis Ritchie: I'm not a person who particularly had heros when growing up.\nObviously, the person who had most influence on my career was Ken Thompson.\nUnix was basically his, likewise C's predecessor, likewise much of the basis\nof Plan 9 (though Rob Pike was the real force in getting it together). And in\nthe meantime Ken created the first computer chess master and pretty much\nrewrote the book on chess endgames. He is quite a phenomenon.\n\nOutside work, what do you enjoy doing?\n\nDennis Ritchie: It all sort of merges together. Much of it is computer-related\n(the WWW and all that). Other than that, reading actual paper, probably. I've\ndone a reasonable amount of travelling, which I enjoyed, but not for too long\nat a time. I'm a home-body and get fatigued by it fairly soon, but enjoy\nthinking back on experiences when I've returned and then often wish I'd\narranged a longer stay in the somewhat exotic place.\n\nAny music, literature or movies you can recommend?\n\nDennis Ritchie: I listen to mostly-classical music, but mostly by radio-- I'm\nnot an audiophile. For books, I don't read much fiction, but like travel\nessays and good pop-science: say Stephen Jay Gould or Kip Thorne. Also some\nhumor--I am a great fan of S. J. Perelman. Right now I'm reading John McPhee's\n\"The Founding Fish.\"\n\nDennis Ritchie's homepage\n\nPowered by werc\n\n", "frontpage": false}
