April 2023 marked the beginning of a new era for web\ngraphics when Google enabled WebGPU by default in Chrome 113. Since then,\nWebGPU adoption has exploded and today, Web3D Survey reports that 62.19% of\nend users can now run WebGPU. With Firefox and Safari due to launch their\nWebGPU support in the not-too-distant future, expect this number to rise\ndramatically in 2024.\n\n## Why WebGPU Matters\n\nIf you enable WebGPU for your PlayCanvas project, you may not notice much\ndifference to begin with. In fact, we have put a great deal of effort into\nensuring your WebGL projects look identical under WebGPU. But over time, there\nis are a great deal of opportunities to achieve performance improvements due\nto WebGPU\u2019s reduced driver overhead.\n\nAnother key feature unique to WebGPU is support for Compute Shaders which\nallow for general computation on the GPU. Support for Compute Shaders landed\nin Engine v1.70.0. Here you can see Computer Shaders in action simulating 1\nmillion particles on the GPU:\n\nClick here to run it for yourself in a WebGPU-enabled browser (i.e. Chrome or\nEdge).\n\nIn short, WebGPU represents the future for PlayCanvas and you can expect some\nincredible advances in performance and functionality over the coming months.\n\n## Getting Started with WebGPU\n\nWebGPU support in PlayCanvas is still considered \u2018Beta\u2019. There are still some\nunimplemented features (for example, the run-time lightmapper is still not\nsupported). Therefore, you have to currently \u2018opt in\u2019 to WebGPU support. To do\nthis, open your Project\u2019s Settings in the Inspector and expand the RENDERING\nsection. Then update Graphics Devices to include WebGPU (beta).\n\nOnce we are satisfied WebGPU support has matured enough, it will become the\ndefault.\n\n## Your Feedback is Important\n\nSince WebGPU support is new, we rely on the community for feedback. What works\nand what doesn\u2019t? Please submit an issue if you discover any problems or kick\noff a new thread on the forum if you want to discuss WebGPU support in more\ndetail. We want to hear what your opinions! \ud83d\udc42\n\nPrevious: Using Visual Studio Code with PlayCanvas\n\n## PlayCanvas Blog\n\n  * PlayCanvas Blog\n  * support@playcanvas.com\n\n  * playcanvas\n  * playcanvas\n\nThe latest news and updates from the PlayCanvas Team.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
