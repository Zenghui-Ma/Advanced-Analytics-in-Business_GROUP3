The\nprogram is designed specifically for a class of malicious programs called\nransomware whose operation consists of data encryption and ransom demand in\norder to gain access to the content again.\n\nIn particular, MicroSCOPE was developed to be able to support two of the\nmainly used formats: the PE (Portable Executable) format for Windows platforms\nand ELF (Executable and Linking Format) for Unix-based platforms. Through the\napplication of certain heuristics, MicroSCOPE is able to assign a score that\ncorresponds to the level of dangerousness of the file being analyzed. The\nhigher the score, the more similar characteristics the software will exhibit\nto ransomware that has already been studied. The heuristics have been\nextrapolated from numerous case studies and will be improved over time.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n  * analysis: folder related to the static analysis of the binaries (including the various phases of MicroSCOPE)\n  * docs: folder containing documentation of the MicroSCOPE project.\n  * formats: folder related to the binary file formats (ELF and PE) including constants, checks and parsing of the binary;\n  * heuristics: the actual heuristics.\n  * utils: general utilities\n\n## How it works\n\nThe analysis performed by MicroSCOPE has three main steps:\n\n  * data mining: in-depth analysis of the binary file based on its extension type (for example: whether PE or ELF file), extrapolating strings, functions it uses and any other information potentially useful for predicting program execution;\n  * application of heuristics: based on the information extrapolated from the first stage, heuristics are applied to figure out how the program will behave when executed. At this stage, a score (summation of the various scores of the heuristics) is calculated;\n  * outcome determination: based on the score and above a certain value (called threshold value - user-defined), MicroSCOPE will associate a certain score with malicious behavior;\n\n## How to use it\n\nDownload the latest release and then run it with the flag -f to specify the\ninput file (must be a valid PE or ELF executable).\n\n    \n    \n    ./microscope -f my_executable_ransomware\n\n## About\n\nStatic analysis tool that can identify potential ransomware on PE or ELF files\nbased on heuristics\n\nnicolo.dev/en/projects/microscope/\n\n### Topics\n\nstatic-analysis ransomware elf binary-analysis pe\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nBSD-3-Clause license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n8 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n1 fork\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 3\n\n0.0.3 Latest\n\nMay 29, 2023\n\n\\+ 2 releases\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Go 92.1%\n  * HTML 7.9%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
