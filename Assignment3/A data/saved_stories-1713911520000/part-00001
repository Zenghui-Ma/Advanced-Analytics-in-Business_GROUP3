Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who\ncovers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The\nNew York Daily News and City & State.\n\nApr 23, 2024, 12:00 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nCath Virginia / The Verge | Photo by Grzegorz Wajda, Getty Images\n\nWhen Tesla releases its first quarter earnings this afternoon, the company\u2019s\nCEO Elon Musk will field the usual questions about new products, new\nfactories, and progress toward its futuristic vision of self-driving cars and\nrobot workers. But Musk will also face increasingly urgent questions about its\ncurrent state of affairs \u2014 and why everything seems to be going to shit.\n\nEarlier this month, the company reported its first year-over-year sales drop\nin four years, a sign of rougher waters ahead. Tesla\u2019s stock has fallen more\nthan 40 percent since the start of the year, including a 13 percent drop in\nthe last week. The company laid off over 14,000 employees last week, 10\npercent of its global workforce \u2014 which could end up being closer to 20\npercent when all\u2019s said and done, according to Bloomberg. Today\u2019s earnings\nreport is expected to include Tesla\u2019s lowest profit margins in six years, a\nsign that rampant price-cutting continues to exact a toll.\n\nMuch hope was pinned on the company\u2019s forthcoming affordable EV, the so-called\n$25,000 \u201cModel 2.\u201d But then Reuters reported that Musk has canceled the\nproject, preferring to sink the company\u2019s resources into a fully autonomous\nrobotaxi. (Musk called the Reuters report \u201clies\u201d but has yet to affirm any\nsupport for the low-cost model.)\n\n\u201cNot quite betting the company, but going balls to the wall for autonomy is a\nblindingly obvious move,\u201d Musk wrote on X, in response to a fan account\npretending to be in disbelief that he would \u201cbet\u201d the company on robotaxis.\n\u201cEverything else is like variations on a horse carriage.\u201d\n\nLayoffs, diminishing sales, a cloudy future, a distracted boss \u2014 all of these\nfactors seem to signal a company in dire straits. Even the Cybertruck, Tesla\u2019s\ngreat stainless steel hope, is being recalled over a faulty accelerator pedal.\nMuch like its polarizing electric truck, Tesla seems to be stuck barreling\nstraight ahead, pedal to the metal, without noticing that the road ahead is\nunder construction.\n\n\u201cWhile we have seen much more tenuous times in the Tesla story going back to\n2015, 2018, 2020..this time is clearly a bit different as for the first time\nmany long time Tesla believers are giving up on the story and throwing in the\nwhite towel,\u201d Wedbush analyst and longtime Tesla bull Dan Ives writes.\n\nTesla remains the world\u2019s most valuable automaker with a market capitalization\nof about $468 billion. It\u2019s still the biggest name in electric vehicles, with\n51 percent share of the market in the US, according to Cox Automotive. But\nthat\u2019s down from 65 percent in 2022, as more automakers beef up their EV\nlineups with viable alternatives and Tesla\u2019s competition heats up.\n\nBut more models haven\u2019t translated to more demand. Almost 269,000 electric\nvehicles were sold in the US in the first three months of 2023 \u2014 a 2.6 percent\nincrease year over year but a 7.3 percent decrease from the previous quarter,\naccording to Kelley Blue Book. Price remains a major obstacles, as does\ncharging and, of course, politics.\n\nMusk warned of a slowdown, but the steep decline still took a lot of people by\nsurprise. (Ives called it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d) Tesla\u2019s sales dropped 13 percent in\nthe first quarter, compared to Q1 in 2023. Meanwhile, its biggest competitors,\nlike BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, and Kia, saw EV sales go up by double or even\ntriple-digits. Ford, for example, saw Q1 sales of its battery-electric\nvehicles rise 86 percent over last year, for a total of 20,223 EVs \u2014 although\nthat number dipped 22 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\u201cTesla believers are giving up on the story and throwing in the white towel\u201d\n\nIn China, where Tesla helped create a market for electric vehicles, the\ncompany is now losing to many of the country\u2019s domestic manufacturers. Tesla\nrecently announced aggressive price cuts in China, which is the largest EV\nmarket in the world. And the company was briefly dethroned as the global EV\nleader by BYD, which sells all kinds of electric models, many of which are\nmore affordable than Tesla\u2019s.\n\nPart of the problem could be Tesla\u2019s lineup. An analysis of 26 global\nautomakers found that the company has the oldest lineup based on when its\nmodels were first released. Also, the company only sells battery-electric\nvehicles, while its legacy auto industry competitors sell a mix of electric,\nhybrid, and gas vehicles. Hybrids have proven to be an important bridge for\nmany consumers who want to go electric but have concerns about making the\nswitch.\n\nBut while current sales may have softened, most experts say that the future is\nunquestionably electric. Gas-powered vehicles are a major contributor to\nplanet-warming carbon emissions and curtailing their sale would be an enormous\nboon in the fight against climate change. And policy changes, including the\nUS\u2019s recent adoption of stricter emissions standards, will push automakers to\ngo all-electric in the years ahead.\n\nTesla was the first company to prove there was a market for electric vehicles.\nBut recently, it has been slow to innovate. And Musk\u2019s leadership has come\nunder question \u2014 especially as he has acquired new companies and taken on new\nprojects, spreading himself remarkably thin in the process.\n\nTesla\u2019s sales dropped 13 percent in the first quarter, compared to Q1 in 2023\n\nAnd now the company\u2019s big bets appear to be flopping. The Cybertruck rollout\nhas been marred by problems, culminating in last week\u2019s hasty recall. Musk\nreportedly canceled the low-cost Model 2 in favor of the upcoming robotaxi \u2014\ndespite repeatedly failing to make good on his promise for a fully driverless\nvehicle.\n\nTesla has been forced to recall its two main driver-assist systems, Autopilot\nand Full Self-Driving, in the face of increased government scrutiny over the\ncompany\u2019s autonomy claims. The families of Tesla drivers who have been killed\nin crashes involving Autopilot have sued the company for wrongful death. And\nMusk\u2019s tenure as head of X, formerly Twitter, has alienated many of Tesla\u2019s\nprogressive-leaning customers, who have watched in horror as he promotes\nright-wing conspiracy theories on the platform.\n\nMusk clearly wants to conquer the world. At the company\u2019s last shareholder\nmeeting, he introduced the idea of a \u201cfully sustainable Earth\u201d and positioned\nTesla \u2014 and himself \u2014 as the most qualified to lead us there.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t introduce was a new model, which was a huge disappointment for\nmany of the company\u2019s boosters on Wall Street. That was a stark reminder that\nfor all of Musk\u2019s bluster and claims about Tesla really being an AI company,\nit\u2019s still just a car company.\n\nWhile other companies are pursuing important innovations like lighter, more\npowerful batteries and recycling techniques that can shrink the auto\nindustry\u2019s carbon footprint, Tesla is putting it all on the line for an\n\u201capocalypse-proof truck\u201d and a full suite of vaporware robots. Oh, and a $56\nbillion payout that a judge rejected and even the company\u2019s top investors\nthink is a trash idea.\n\nTesla\u2019s grip on the EV market is slipping. If Musk can\u2019t articulate a clear\nand positive vision for Tesla, it could slip even further.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## An Xbox VR headset is on the way, but it\u2019s a \u2018limited edition\u2019 Meta Quest\n\n  2. ## Anker\u2019s 8-in-1 charging station is matching its lowest price to date\n\n  3. ## Why is Windows 11 so annoying?\n\n  4. ## Tesla\u2019s in its flop era\n\n  5. ## Apple announces May 7th event for new iPads\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Transpo\n\n  * ### Amazon is shutting down its drone delivery service in California as it looks to other markets\n\n  * ### Tesla slashes Full Self-Driving price after Elon Musk said it would only get more expensive\n\n  * ### This is Tesla\u2019s riveting fix for recalled Cybertruck accelerator pedals\n\n  * ### Kia\u2019s more affordable EV2 is getting ready to undercut Tesla\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
