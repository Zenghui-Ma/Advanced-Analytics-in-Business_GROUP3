Where I dive into my story, a tale\nof setbacks, perseverance, and the exciting launch of Cocomail.\n\nThe Startup Rollercoaster:\n\nIt all began last September. My previous marketplace venture, a year in the\nmaking, hit a brick wall. My co-founder threw in the towel just before a\npotential pre-seed investment. Ouch. Talk about burning social capital!\n\nBut hey, a decade of experience in marketing and startups had fueled an\nentrepreneurial fire within me. Consulting for early-stage SaaS companies kept\nthe bills paid, but the itch to build something on my own terms never faded.\n\nFinding My Co-Pilot:\n\nFast forward to January. I took a leap of faith, posting on Reddit for a tech\nco-founder (check out the (almost) viral thread here: link to Reddit post.\n\nAfter sifting through a sea of applicants, destiny intervened. Jonas, a\nSwedish developer with a knack for complex products, entered the picture. His\nconfidence and past work resonated with me.\n\nFrom Brainstorm to Blastoff:\n\nFor two weeks, we brainstormed ideas. The criteria were simple: solve a\nfundamental problem, platform-agnostic, validated market. Cocomail, our email\nautomation platform for SaaS companies, was born.\n\nBuilding Cocomail:\n\nWe hit the ground running \u2013 writing about Cocomail, listing it on directories,\nand even announcing it on Reddit. The waitlist grew to over 100 signups! Just\nfour days after going public, we landed our first paid user, a win that felt\nnothing short of surreal. They migrated from a major player like Mailgun, a\nhuge vote of confidence in our solution.\n\nThe Road Ahead:\n\nOur sights are set on reaching $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) by\nyear's end. We're fueled by the early traction and excited to keep building\nCocomail.\n\nSee you next week, Pruthvi Founder, QuickFlips\n\nConnect with me: Follow my startup journey on Twitter: @pruthvi_eth:\nhttps://twitter.com/pruthvi_eth\n\nReady to automate your SaaS emails?
