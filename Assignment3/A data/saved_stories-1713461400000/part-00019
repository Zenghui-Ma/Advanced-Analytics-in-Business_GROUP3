Apple recently removed an emulator called iGBA from the App Store for\nripping off Testut's code for Delta and its predecessor GBA4iOS, while the\ndeveloper of NES emulator Bimmy decided to remove the app from the App Store\nto avoid the risk of legal action from Nintendo.\n\n## Legality\n\nWhile a U.S. court ruled that emulators are legal, downloading copyrighted\nROMs is typically against the law in the country. On its customer support\nwebsite in the U.S., Nintendo says that downloading pirated copies of its\ngames is illegal:\n\n> Pirate copies of game files are often referred to as \"ROMs\".\n>\n> The uploading and downloading of pirate copies of Nintendo games is illegal.\n\nNintendo recently sued the developers of Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu for\n\"facilitating piracy at a colossal scale,\" leading to a reported $2.4 million\nsettlement. Nintendo has yet to comment on the availability of emulators in\nthe App Store, but Delta and its predecessor GBA4iOS have been available on\nthe iPhone outside of the App Store for over a decade now without being shut\ndown. Nintendo did issue a DMCA takedown notice against the GBA4iOS website in\n2014, but the emulators have continued to remain available.\n\nFor those who want to abide by the letter of the law, it is generally legal to\ndownload and play \"homebrew\" games available in the public domain.\n\nTags: App Store, Emulator\n\n[ 29 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nDFZD\n\n13 hours ago at 12:02 pm\n\n> Wish Nintendo would buyout the emulator developed without their help and\n> release them with content available above-board.\n\nI have a large clock tower to sell you next time you are in London.\n\nScore: 5 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nvertsix\n\n13 hours ago at 11:47 am\n\nMost notably, JIT (just-in-time) compilation is not allowed at the OS-level,\nsomething Android has.\n\nThis is due to security issues, which are valid, but will affect emulation of\na lot of hardware.\n\nSo Android still has the upside here, but now Apple allowing emulators removes\none of the biggest reasons to use Android (if you don't care about JIT and\nemulating some hardware).\n\nI'm excited what other emulators surface.\n\nScore: 4 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nCameront9\n\n9 hours ago at 03:55 pm\n\nSome background as to why emulators are legal.\n\nScore: 3 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nDFZD\n\n13 hours ago at 11:51 am\n\nWe all are waiting for Ryujinx.

So, roughly anything before\n> 1995.\n\nThe N64 emulated by Delta is post-PlayStation, from 1996, and the Nintendo DS\nis even from 2004. So the GameCube and PS2 should be fine.\n\nLet\u2019s say everything before the iPhone is \u201cretro\u201d. Or maybe everything not\nnewer than what Apple calls \u201cvintage\u201d. ;)\n\nScore: 2 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nRead All Comments\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n### iOS 18 Will Add These New Features to Your iPhone\n\nFriday April 12, 2024 11:11 am PDT by MacRumors Staff\n\niOS 18 is expected to be the \"biggest\" update in the iPhone's history.
