We build powerful tools for VC\u2019s,\nangels and founders to raise and deploy capital seamlessly. You can learn more\nabout our mission here.\n\n###\n\nThis is an image you may have seen doing the rounds at some point.\n\nIt shows, very clearly, how the quantitative revolution has affected\nbasketball. When you run the numbers, the only places it makes sense to take a\nshot from are outside the D (3 points) or right next to the basket (2 points).\nAs a result, nowadays every team in the NBA plays basketball this way.\n\nBut it is not just basketball (or, famously, baseball) that has adopted\n\u201cmoneyball\u201d. Like an incredibly contagious virus, the philosophy of moneyball\nhas rapidly spread, infecting the entirety of human culture.\n\nAnd it\u2019s making everything boring as f*ck.\n\nIn 2022, the 10 most popular films in the world included eight franchise\nsequels (Top Gun, Jurassic Park, Avatar, Minions, a Shrek spinout, three\nMarvel movies), and a rehash of Batman. In 2023, we got four sequels (two more\nMarvels, the umpteenth Fast and Furious instalment and Mission Impossible: Is\nit Possible Tom Cruise Is Still Making These Films) plus two spinouts from\ntoys (Barbie, Super Mario). There was also a rehash of the Little Mermaid. To\nround things off, the angelic Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet brought us Wonka, a prequel to\na film that was a rehash of a film that was a rehash of a book.\n\nBarely anything original makes it into the charts any more. We get moneyball\nmovies instead, reliable content that is kind of sh*t but comfortably\nfamiliar.\n\nIt\u2019s the same story in music. The music industry has been getting steadily\nmore data-driven (read: boring) since the early \u201890s. Studies indicate pop\nhits are getting more similar over time. Country is fast becoming one of the\nmost popular music genres in the world, and it all sounds the same.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not just you.\n\nEverything is getting more boring.1\n\n###\n\nMaybe non-traditional media is different?\n\nNah.\n\nThanks to short form video on TikTok, Youtube and Instagram, you are now fed a\nconstant, frustratingly addictive stream of the-same-but-slightly-different\nvideo clips whenever you open your phone. In the battle to monopolise your\ntime, these algorithms optimise for easy to consume mental fast food that they\nknow you\u2019ll like just enough to keep watching.\n\nIn spite of yourself, you are sucked in, scrolling and scrolling for just one\nmore hit from the mind numbing bong of boring.\n\nThis whole industry is about to get a steroid injection. As AI becomes more\ningrained in our culture, the media we create and the very paper we write on\ngets embedded with universal, data-driven, computer generated \u201cintelligence\".\nThis can almost wholly replace human curation, creation and even\nrelationships.\n\nIt is also where things start to get rather sinister.\n\nTiktok has recently been openly paying people to pump out really, really dumb\nconspiracy theory content generated with AI.\n\nLast year, some lady \u201cmarried\u201d her chatbot.\n\nWe are not far from a place where the vast majority of images, videos, news\narticles, movies, food recipes, psychological counselling programs,\neducational syllabuses, conversations or whatever you can think of are being\ngenerated almost entirely by algorithms, based on simple prompts.\n\nWe are no longer creating. We are, in many ways, simply lending our voice to\nan algorithm. The world, as a result, becomes ever more shaped and optimised\naccording to the goals of our corporate machine overlords. Their primary\nobjective? To leverage the data you provide to generate profits.\n\nThe risk is that each of us will end up trapped in a dumbed down algorithmic\nbubble of our own creation, exposed to far fewer ideas that challenge us, or\nbring us outside of our comfort zone.\n\nEverything you see taste feel think believe will be algorithmically predicted,\nnarrowed, pre-ordained.\n\nSounds really f*cking boring.\n\n###\n\nI am, however, an optimist.\n\nThings go in cycles. I do not think this will last.\n\nWhat makes you uniquely human is, in many ways, the exact opposite of all of\nthis. It is the way that your right brain - the chaotic, emotional, intuitive,\ncreative, big-picture part of it - balances your left - the rational, orderly,\nlinear process manager.\n\nThe part of you that feels things - joy, pain, love, humour, sadness and anger\n- is a key input in your ability to innovate. It will become increasingly\nvaluable in a world that is saturated with data and sameness.2\n\nIn fact, this magic, when combined with AI, has the potential to unleash\ncreativity and variety at never seen before scales. Things like this hilarious\nC3PO rap video can already be made by one person. We\u2019ve come a long way from\nWill Smith eating spaghetti, in a very, very short space of time. The\npotential for the future is boundless.\n\nI imagine the current excitement about AI feels a lot like the early days of\nthe internet. A miraculous new technology promises a world where anything is\npossible, and anyone can be a part of it.\n\nBut the internet, and in many ways the world, came to be controlled by a small\nnumber of companies, and steered to serve their objectives. AI may well push\nus further down that path. This is, in fact, exactly what the VC firms backing\nOpen AI, Anthropic et al. are betting on.3\n\nWhat we must be careful to protect going forwards is our humanity. Our\nemotions, our chaos, our randomness and its variety. The yin to AI\u2019s yang.\n\nWe still don\u2019t really understand how the human brain works. Is it plugged into\nsome sort of universal consciousness substrate? Does it work via some form of\nquantum mechanics?\n\nWhat is for certain is that it doesn\u2019t work like a modern AI. You think, and\ncreate, in a very different, independent, unpredictable way.\n\nAnd that is exactly what makes the world interesting.\n\nPR\n\nFund something interesting on Odin\n\nNew here?

Sorry I haven\u2019t written anything in so long! Fatherhood and a bunch of\nchanges in how we run things at Odin have kept me busy. I am planning a return\nto regular posts as of this week.\n\n1\n\nI am heavily indebted for this section of the article to a piece called \u201cWhat\nMoneyball-for-Everything Has Done to American Culture\u201d by Derek Thompson\n\n2\n\nIf you want to dive deeper on the differences between the right brain and the\nleft brain, and the way in which the left brain (order, rationality, systems\nthinking - basically more similar to a computer) has come to dominate modern\nculture, there\u2019s a great documentary on Netflix about it called \u201cThe Divided\nBrain\u201d. It\u2019s based on a book called \u201cthe Master and His Emissary\u201d.\n\n3\n\nThe Master Switch by Tim Wu is a great book to check out on the way in which\nnew technologies create cycles of openness followed by periods of control, and\nhow the swings get bigger (and more dangerous) in the era of information\ntechnology.\n\n### Subscribe to The Odin Times\n\nLaunched 4 years ago\n\nA newsletter about investing, tech, economics and more.\n\n36 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n5 Restacks\n\n36\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Greetings from the future it's really f*cking boring\n\nblog.joinodin.com\n\n6\n\nShare\n\n6 Comments\n\nDavid VandervortTechnoScreedApr 15Liked by Patrick RyanThe interesting stuff\nhas always been on the edges.
