In this case, the news organization eagerly\njumped on a non-controversy because, well, that\u2019s what it does.\n\nThe piece mashes together two essentially unrelated things, into a murky mess.\n\nOne central element is a rehash of the argument surrounding the anti-NPR\nscreed a now-former employee published on a right-wing newsletter. That piece\nis full of complaints \u2014 and a number of falsehoods \u2014 about coverage and events\nthat preceded Maher\u2019s move to NPR.\n\nThe other, \u201cnew\u201d element, is the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of Maher\u2019s years-old tweets in\nwhich she had the temerity to speak the truth about Trump and his extremist\ncult. The sub-head shown above, quoting her plain-truth assertion that Trump\nis a racist, is turned into controversy for what reason, exactly? Trump is a\nracist, a blatant one. But telling the truth about him is problematic \u2014 that\nis, when right-wing trolls say it is.\n\nReading (not far) between the lines, it seems that the source of this non-\nscandal is Christopher Rufo. Relevant section:\n\n> Christopher Rufo, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, called\n> attention to many of Ms. Maher\u2019s posts on X and shared a response from\n> Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, who had responded to one of Ms. Maher\u2019s\n> posts that Mr. Rufo highlighted, saying, \u201cThis person is a crazy racist!\u201d\n>\n> \u201cIf NPR wants to truly be National Public Radio, it can\u2019t pander to the\n> furthest-left elements in the United States,\u201d Mr. Rufo said in an interview.\n> \u201cTo do so, NPR should part ways with Katherine Maher.\u201d\n\nThere is absolutely zero context here. Rufo is an right-wing activist who has\nturned his bad-faith trolling into a career. At the very least, the Times\nreaders should have been told about this sleazy character\u2019s track record.\n\nThere\u2019s more about this article I could pound on, but you get the point. The\nreporter failed here, but so did his editors.\n\nIf this was a rare occurrence in the Times\u2019 coverage of political issues \u2014 and\nthe attacks on Maher (actually attacks on NPR) are purely political \u2014 I would\nchalk it up to what happens in a deadline-driven business. But the Times\u2019\npolitical coverage does this kind of thing all the time.\n\nI love the Times for a lot of the other things it does so well; it truly is a\ngreat news organization in other ways. But I loathe it for the way it\nconsistently \u2014 and, let\u2019s face it, deliberately \u2014 helps the people who are\ntrying to wreck our democracy.\n\nPosted in Etcetera | Leave a comment\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Again, NY Times amplifies right-wing trolling, omits vital context\n  * What\u2019s next for me...\n  * Big Journalism is still Trump\u2019s stenographer\n  * Washington political \u201cjournalism\u201d keeps hitting new lows\n  * Not the Onion: Fox hiring \u201cdisinformation specialist\u201d\n\nFollow me at Mastodon\n\nThis site is powered by WordPress and styled with SemPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
