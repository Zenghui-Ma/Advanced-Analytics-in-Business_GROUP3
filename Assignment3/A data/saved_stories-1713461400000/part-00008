It was\ndefined in 1992 by Aleksey Vsevolodovich Nikolayev, corresponding member of\nthe Russian Academy of Sciences: \"A tectonic or seismic weapon would be the\nuse of the accumulated tectonic energy of the Earth's deeper layers to induce\na destructive earthquake\".^[1] He added \"to set oneself the objective of\ninducing an earthquake is extremely doubtful.\" Though no such device is known\nto have been built, tectonic weapons have occasionally appeared as plot\ndevices in works of fiction.\n\n## Concept[edit]\n\nTheoretically, the tectonic weapon functions by creating a powerful charge of\nelastic energy in the form of deformed volume of the Earth's crust in a region\nof tectonic activity.^[2] This then becomes an earthquake once triggered by a\nnuclear explosion in the epicenter or a vast electric pulse.^[2] As to the\nquestion of whether a nuclear explosion can trigger an earthquake, there was\nthe analysis of local seismic recordings within a couple of miles of nuclear\ntests in the 1960s at Nevada that showed nuclear explosions caused some\ntectonic stress.^[3] The 1968 Faultless underground nuclear test caused faults\nto slip up to 40 km away.^[4] The United States Geological Survey stated that\nit produced fresh fault rupture some 1,200 meters long.^[3] There is also a\ntheory that a 1998 earthquake in Afghanistan was triggered by thermonuclear\ntests conducted in Indian and Pakistani test sites 2-20 days prior.^[3]^[5]\n\n## Reports[edit]\n\nRoger Clark, lecturer in geophysics at Leeds University said in the journal\nNature in 1996, responding to a newspaper report that there had been two\nsecret Soviet programs, \"Mercury\" and \"Volcano\", aimed at developing a\n\"tectonic weapon\" that could set off earthquakes from great distance by\nmanipulating electromagnetism, said \"We don't think it is impossible, or\nwrong, but past experience suggests it is very unlikely\". According to Nature\nthese programs had been \"unofficially known to Western geophysicists for\nseveral years\". According to the story the Mercury program began in 1987,\nthree tests were conducted in Kyrgyzstan, and Volcano's last test occurred in\n1992.^[6]\n\nSuch weapons, whether or not they exist or are feasible, are a source of\nconcern in official circles. For example, US Secretary of Defense William S.\nCohen, said on 28 April 1997 at the Conference on Terrorism, Weapons of Mass\nDestruction, and U.S. Strategy, University of Georgia, while discussing the\ndangers of false threats, \"Others are engaging even in an eco-type of\nterrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes\nremotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.\"^[7]\n\nNew Zealand's unsuccessful Project Seal programme during World War II\nattempted to create a tsunami bomb, generating tsunami waves as a weapon. It\nwas reported in 1999 that such a weapon might be viable.^[8]\n\nNikola Tesla claimed a small (something \"you could put in your overcoat\npocket\") steam-powered mechanical oscillator he was experimenting with in 1898\nproduced earthquake-like effects, but this has never been replicated. The\ntelevision show MythBusters in 2006 Episode 60 \u2013 \"Earthquake Machine\" made a\nsmall machine using a specially designed computer-controlled electromagnetic\nlinear actuator instead of steam; it produced vibrations in a large structure\ndetectable hundreds of feet away, but no significant shaking. Their judgement\nwas that the test with their version of the oscillator busted the myth.^[9]\n\n## International treaties[edit]\n\nThe 1978 Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of\nEnvironmental Modification Techniques is an international treaty ratified by\n75 states, and signed by a further 17, that prohibits use of environmental\nmodification techniques to cause earthquakes and tsunamis, amongst other\nphenomena.^[10]\n\n## Conspiracy theories[edit]\n\nAfter natural tectonic phenomena such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, conspiracy\ntheories, usually relating to the armed forces of the United States and\nformerly the Soviet Union (USSR), often arise, though no evidence is advanced.\nAfter the Haiti earthquake it was widely reported that president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\nof Venezuela made unsupported allegations that it had been caused by testing\nof a US tectonic weapon.^[11] The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda of Moscow\nreported on page 1 on 30 May 1992 that \"a geophysical or tectonic weapon was\nactually developed in the USSR despite the UN Convention\", but that Chief\nSeismologist Major-General V Bochrov of the USSR Ministry of Defence\ncategorically rejected any hints on the existence of tectonic weapons.^[12] On\n8 February 2023, Romanian Senator Diana Iovanovici \u0218o\u0219oac\u0103 accused the United\nStates of having caused the 2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquakes using a seismic\nweapon.^[13]\n\n## \"Earthquake bombs\"[edit]\n\nWhile the British Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs of World War II were called\nearthquake bombs, the name came from their way of destroying very hardened\ntargets by shaking their foundations as an earthquake would; they were never\nintended to cause an actual earthquake.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Red mercury\n  * HAARP\n  * Weather warfare\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ 927N0104A Moscow ZNANIYE-Sila (in Russian) No. 1, Jan 92 p2-13, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology, October 1992\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Kotlyakov, Valdimir (2010).
