However, how cognitive control regulates working memory\nstorage is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and\nhippocampal persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude\ncoupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and\nfrontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.\nIn the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.\nWe identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of\ntheta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was\ncoordinated with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was\nhigh. By introducing noise correlations with persistently active neurons in\nthe hippocampus, PAC neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This\nled to higher-fidelity representations of working memory content that were\nassociated with improved behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent\narchitecture of working memory^1,2, with frontal control managing maintenance\nof working memory content in storage-related areas^3,4,5. Within this\nframework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control and working memory\nstorage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for top-\ndown control over sensory-driven processes.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Phase-dependent amplification of working memory content and performance\n\nArticle Open access 14 April 2020\n\nSanne ten Oever, Peter De Weerd & Alexander T.

Joshua Jacobs\n\n## Main\n\nWorking memory (WM), the ability to maintain and manipulate a limited amount\nof information in mind for a brief period of time^6, is a crucial component of\ncognition that is often compromised in disease. WM maintenance is an active\nprocess that retains information that is no longer available in the external\nworld. A mechanism that is thought to support WM is persistent neural\nactivity^7,8,9,10. In humans, memoranda-specific persistent activity has been\nobserved in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL)^11,12, an area of the brain\nthat becomes essential for WM when distractors are present or memory load is\nhigh^13. It is thought that cognitive control is required to support the\nmaintenance of WM content under these circumstances^1,2. Models of WM assign\nthe role of control to the frontal lobes^3,4,14, but little is known about how\nstorage and control mechanisms interact.\n\nA ubiquitous macroscopic electrophysiological phenomenon is TG-\nPAC^15,16,17,18,19,20,21. Although its functional role remains poorly\nunderstood, a major hypothesis is that PAC enables the integration of local\nsensory information processing with brain-wide cognitive control^22,23. Within\nthis framework, local increases in power in the gamma-frequency range (30\u2013140\nHz)^24,25,26,27 reflect local processing, whereas long-range interareal\ninteractions in the theta range (3\u20137 Hz) mediate cognitive control^28,29,30.\nTG-PAC could therefore serve as a tool to integrate these two processes in\nlocal circuitries^16,31,32. However, to date, it remains unclear how these\ntheories translate to single-neuron activity and how PAC exerts control over\nWM maintenance processes. Here we test the hypothesis that neurons whose\nactivity is modulated by both theta phase and gamma amplitude are engaged in\ninterareal interactions between the frontal and temporal lobes, thereby\nexerting PAC-mediated cognitive control over WM storage. We examined whether\ntop-down control directly modulated the cells that carry information about the\nmemoranda currently held in WM or whether, alternatively, control is exerted\nindirectly through a different group of cells.\n\nWe recorded single-cell and local field potential (LFP) activity from the\nmedial frontal cortex and MTL while patients who had undergone neurosurgery\nperformed a WM task (36 patients, 44 sessions; Supplementary Table 5) with\npictures as stimuli. All of the pictures belonged to one of five visual\ncategories. In each trial, the patients maintained either one (load 1) or\nthree (load 3) consecutively presented pictures in their WM for 2.5\u20132.8 s\n(Fig. 1a). The patients were then asked whether a probe stimulus shown was\nidentical to one of the item(s) they were holding in WM. Mean accuracy was\n93.66 \u00b1 7.04% (mean \u00b1 s.d.; 78.34 \u00b1 20.09% of all errors were false negatives)\nand the participants responded slower (1.46 s versus 1.33 s; t_43 = 6.42, P <\n0.001) and less accurately (91.60% versus 95.71%; t_43 = \u22124.45, P < 0.001) in\nload 3 trials compared with load 1 trials (Fig. 1d).\n\nFig. 1: Task, recording sites and behaviour.\n\na, An example trial. Each trial consisted of either one (load 1) and three\n(load 3) consecutively presented pictures, each presented for 2 s (separated\nby a variable blank screen of up to 200 ms as indicated by a small dot). After\na variable maintenance period with an average duration of 2.7 s, a probe\npicture was presented. The task was to decide whether the probe picture has\nbeen part of the pictures shown during encoding in this trial (the correct\nanswer was \u2018No\u2019 in the example shown). For copyright reasons, the pictures\nshown are similar but not identical to those used in the study. b, The\nrecording locations. Each coloured dot represents the location of a microwire\nbundle across all 44 sessions shown on a standardized MNI152 brain template\n(left) and in a 3D model using the Brainnetome Atlas (right).

Patients made fewer errors (P = 0.0001) and\nresponded faster (P = 0.0001) in load 1 compared with load 3 trials.\nStatistical analysis was performed using two-sided permutation-based t-tests\nwith 10,000 permutations. Each line connects the two dots belonging to the\nsame session. n = 44 sessions. The RT was measured relative to the probe\nstimulus onset. Data are mean \u00b1 s.e.m. ***P < 0.001.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Hippocampal PAC is modulated by WM load\n\nWe recorded from 1,454 single neurons (Fig. 1b,c) and from 1,922 microwire\nchannels with LFP (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g) across the hippocampus, amygdala,\npre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex\n(dACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). To determine whether PAC\nwas present in the LFP during the WM maintenance period, we estimated PAC as a\nfunction of low-frequency (2\u201314 Hz) phase and high-frequency (30\u2013150 Hz)\npower. Across all of the recorded channels (Fig. 2a; average plots per brain\narea are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2a), PAC was strongest between the phase\nin the theta range (3\u20137 Hz) and the amplitude in two different gamma-frequency\nbands\u2014a lower (30\u201355 Hz) and a higher gamma range (70\u2013140 Hz). For each\nchannel, we then separately averaged the normalized modulation indices in the\ntheta to low-gamma and the theta to high-gamma combinations and assessed which\nof the channels exhibited significant PAC across both load conditions in the\ngiven frequency combination (averaged z score > 1.64; P < 0.05; right sided).\nFor theta to high-gamma PAC, 137 out of 586 hippocampal channels showed\nsignificant PAC across all correct trials from both load conditions (Fig. 2b).\nFor these 137 channels, we then compared the PAC estimates between the two\nload conditions. This comparison revealed significantly weaker theta\u2013high-\ngamma PAC in load 3 compared with load 1 trials (t_136 = \u22124.26, P < 0.001;\nFig. 2c (left); false-discovery rate (FDR) corrected for the five brain\nregions of interest^33; Fig. 2d shows PAC for a single example channel in the\nhippocampus; Fig. 2e shows the average PAC across all significant PAC channels\nin the hippocampus).\n\nFig. 2: TG-PAC.\n\na, Average normalized modulation indices for all phase\u2013amplitude pairs. n =\n1,917 channels. b, The proportion of channels with significant theta\u2013high-\ngamma PAC in each area, determined by comparisons to trial-shuffled surrogates\n(both loads). The horizontal lines indicate the 99th percentile of the\nsurrogate null distribution per area (P = 0.005 for hippocampus (hippo.),\namygdala (amy.) and vmPFC; right-sided permutation test, no adjustment for\nmultiple comparisons). c, log-normalized modulation indices were averaged\nwithin the theta\u2013high-gamma band in each load and compared between the loads\nin each significant PAC channel in each region. Only in the hippocampus,\ntheta\u2013high-gamma PAC differed as a function of load, with PAC higher in load 1\nversus load 3 trials (left: n = 137 channels, P = 0.0005; amygdala (middle): n\n= 130, P = 0.38; vmPFC (right): n = 40, P = 0.87; two-sided permutation-based\nt-tests; FDR corrected for all five brain areas). z-scored values were shifted\ninto a positive range by an offset of 1 and log-transformed for illustrative\npurposes only. All statistics are based on non-transformed z values. d,\nExample gamma amplitude distribution over theta phase as well as comodulograms\nwith raw modulation indices in each load for a representative hippocampal\nchannel. Note the wider distribution of gamma amplitude over theta phase in\nload 3 trials, which leads to lower levels of PAC (further analysis is\nprovided in Extended Data Fig. 3a). Normalized MI values were as follows for\nthe two examples shown: load 1, z = 16.52; load 3, z = 7.92. e, Average\nnormalized modulation indices for significant hippocampal PAC channels. n =\n137. f, TG-PAC was significantly negatively correlated with RTs in the\nhippocampus (n = 137, P = 6 \u00d7 10^\u22125, mixed-effects GLM), but not in the\namygdala (n = 130, P = 0.48) or the vmPFC (n = 40, P = 0.24). GLM results are\nshown in Supplementary Table 2. Each dot represents a significant PAC channel.\nFor c,f, data are mean \u00b1 s.e.m. *P < 0.05; NS, not significant.\n\nFull size image\n\nTwo other brain areas also exhibited substantial proportions of channels with\nsignificant PAC: the amygdala and the vmPFC (Fig. 2b). However, in contrast to\nthe hippocampus, theta\u2013high-gamma PAC did not differ significantly between the\ntwo load conditions in neither of these two areas (Fig. 2c; t_129 = 1.43, P =\n0.38, Bayes factor (BF)_01 = 1.40; and t_39 = 0.16, P = 0.87, BF_01 = 5.84,\nrespectively). In the other two frontal areas that we examined (pre-SMA and\ndACC), only a small proportion of channels had significant theta\u2013high-gamma\nPAC (Fig. 2b) and PAC in these channels did not differ significantly between\nthe two loads (pre-SMA: t_4 = \u22120.16, P = 0.87; dACC: t_13 = \u22120.82, P = 0.73).\nThese observations were qualitatively comparable when averaging channels\nwithin each patient (Extended Data Fig. 2b). For PAC involving the low gamma\nband (30\u201355 Hz), there were no significant differences between the load\nconditions in any of the regions (Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary\nTable 1). Next, we asked whether PAC is associated with reaction times (RTs),\nwith the idea that faster RTs indicate success of control. In the hippocampus,\nfaster RTs were associated with stronger single-trial estimates of TG-PAC\n(Methods and Supplementary Table 2; Fig. 2f shows univariate correlation\ncoefficients for illustration; all statistics and conclusions are based on the\ngeneralized linear model (GLM) results). By contrast, there were no\nsignificant correlations between PAC and RT in the amygdala and vmPFC (Fig. 2f\nand Supplementary Table 2).\n\nLastly, we tested whether the differences in hippocampal PAC between loads\ncould be explained by changes in power, theta waveform shape, cross-frequency\nphase\u2013phase coupling, preferred phase or PAC peak frequency but did not find\nevidence for any of those factors (Extended Data Fig. 3). These findings\nsuggest that PAC is related to ongoing WM processes during the maintenance\nperiod in the hippocampus, but not in the amygdala or frontal lobe.\n\n## Category cells support WM maintenance\n\nWe next investigated whether cells remained persistently active during WM\nmaintenance and, if so, whether their activity was related to PAC. We first\nselected for category neurons, which are cells of which the firing rate (FR)\nwas related to the visual category of the stimuli shown during encoding\n(Methods). We identified such cells at numbers higher than expected by chance\nwithin the hippocampus (89 neurons (24.72%)), amygdala (181 neurons (36.49%))\nand vmPFC (37 neurons (17.96%)) but not within the pre-SMA and dACC (Extended\nData Fig. 4a; an example hippocampal neuron is shown in Fig. 3a). During the\nmaintenance period, the FRs of the identified category neurons remained\nelevated during the maintenance period compared with the baseline across all\nof the correct trials in the MTL, but not in the vmPFC (Fig. 3b shows the\nhippocampus and amygdala combined for simplicity; statistics per area are\nshown in Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the FRs of category cells were\nsignificantly higher in trials in which a stimulus of the preferred category\nof a cell was held in WM relative to when patients held stimuli in mind that\nbelonged to the non-preferred categories of a cell in the MTL, but not the\nvmPFC (t_269 = 2.93, P = 0.001; Fig. 3b; see Extended Data Fig. 4b for vmPFC).\nCategory neurons in the MTL but not the frontal lobe therefore exhibited\nstimulus-specific persistent activity (statistics per area are shown in\nExtended Data Fig. 4b). For this reason, we focus on MTL category neurons for\nthe remainder of the paper.\n\nFig. 3: FRs and SFC of category neurons in MTL.\n\na, Example hippocampal category neuron. The preferred category of this neuron\nwas \u2018animals\u2019. Pic., picture. b, Category neurons (n = 270) remained active\n(preferred (pref.) versus baseline (bsl), P = 0.0001; non-preferred (non-\npref.), P = 0.0001) and retained their selectivity during the maintenance\nperiod, with FRs higher for preferred compared with non-preferred categories\n(P = 0.001). FRs are shown as the percentage change compared with the baseline\n(\u22120.9 to \u22120.3 s before picture 1 onset). c, FRs of category neurons were\nhigher in load 1 compared with load 3 trials with their preferred category\nheld in WM (n = 270, P = 0.004) during the maintenance period. d, Category\nneurons fired more in correct compared with incorrect trials (n = 246, P =\n0.02). e, SFC between spikes and LFPs from the same area. The slice\n(https://osf.io/r2hvk/) was obtained under a Creative Commons licence CC BY\n4.0. f, Paired with PAC channels, hippocampal category neurons were more\nstrongly phase-locked to local gamma LFPs with the preferred category held in\nWM (n = 151 combinations; P = 0.004). Differences were not significant in the\namygdala (n = 423) or non-PAC channels (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Statistical\nanalysis was performed using two-sided cluster-based permutation t-tests. g,\nGamma (70\u2013140 Hz) SFC for hippocampal category neurons was stronger for\npreferred versus non-preferred trials in both load conditions (main effect\npreference, F_1,150 = 16.23, P = 0.0001; load 1, P = 0.003; load 3, P =\n0.004). No main effect of load (P = 0.25) or interaction (P = 0.33) was found.\nEach dot is a neuron\u2013LFP channel pair (n = 151). h, TG-PAC was positively\ncorrelated with the FR of category neurons in the hippocampus (n = 151, P =\n0.017, mixed-effects GLM), but not in the amygdala (n = 423, P = 0.45). The\nGLM results are shown in Supplementary Table 3. For b\u2013d,g, statistical\nanalysis was performed using two-sided permutation-based t-tests (b\u2013d, lower\nbrackets in g) and F-tests (top bracket in g). For a\u2013d,f\u2013h, data are mean \u00b1\ns.e.m. (coloured areas in a,f); **P < 0.01.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe activity of category neurons in the MTL was modulated by load, with FRs\nhigher in load 1 than in load 3 in preferred trials (t_269 = 2.65, P = 0.004;\nFig. 3c), but not in non-preferred trials (t_269 = \u22121.46, P = 0.14; Extended\nData Fig. 5a) during the maintenance period. Moreover, FRs were higher in\ncorrect as compared to incorrect trials across both load conditions (t_245 =\n2.43, P = 0.02; Fig. 3d; 24 neurons were excluded from this comparison due to\ninsufficient data in the incorrect condition; patient-level statistics are\nshown in Extended Data Fig. 5b). There was no significant difference in the\nFRs between fast and slow RT trials (median split; computed per load condition\nand then averaged across loads for the preferred category and correct trials\nonly; hippocampus, t_88 = 0.73, P = 0.47; amygdala, t_180 = 1.38, P = 0.18).\nTogether, these data demonstrate the relevance of category cells to WM\nmaintenance.\n\nWe next examined how spike timing of category neurons in the MTL relates to\nthe phase of LFPs by examining their spike-field coherence (SFC; Methods)\nduring the maintenance period in channels with significant PAC (Fig. 3e). In\nthe hippocampus, high-gamma-band SFC was significantly stronger in preferred\ntrials than in non-preferred trials for neuron-to-channel combinations that\ninvolved significant PAC channels (cluster P = 0.004; Fig. 3f). This\ndifference in gamma-band SFC was present in both load 1 and load 3 (Fig. 3g;\npreferred versus non-preferred trials in load 1 (t_150 = 3.14, P = 0.003) and\nload 3 (t_150 = 2.88, P = 0.004)). Computing the same statistic for theta-band\nSFC did not reveal any significant effects (Extended Data Fig. 5c), confirming\nspecificity to gamma. Notably, this gamma cluster spanned approximately the\nsame frequencies at which theta\u2013high-gamma PAC was present (Extended Data Fig.\n5f,g shows comparisons including all channels and patient-level results). We\ndid not find similar effects for the theta band (Fig. 3f), non-PAC channels\n(Extended Data Fig. 5e) or the amygdala (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 5e,f).\nFinally, SFC was different between preferred and non-preferred trials only for\nspikes that occurred during high (t_150 = 3.06, P = 0.002) but not low high-\ngamma band power in the hippocampus (t_150 = 0.26, P = 0.85; Extended Data\nFig. 5d). Thus, specifically in periods in which gamma amplitude was high,\nspikes of category neurons were more strongly synchronized to the phase of\ngamma-band LFP.\n\nWe next determined whether spiking activity of category cells during the WM\nmaintenance period correlated with PAC trial-by-trial (Methods). In the\nhippocampus, PAC was weakly but significantly positively correlated with the\nFR of category neurons (Supplementary Table 3; Fig. 3h shows correlation\ncoefficients for illustration only; all conclusions are based on the GLM\nresults). In the amygdala, there were no significant correlations between\nsingle-trial TG-PAC and FR of category neurons (Fig. 3h and Supplementary\nTable 3). Together, these results show that persistently active hippocampal\ncategory-selective neurons were more synchronized with gamma LFPs when their\npreferred category was held in WM. This effect was specific to channels that\nshowed significant TG-PAC during the maintenance period. Also, FRs of\nhippocampal category neurons were correlated with single-trial estimates of\nPAC.\n\n## Category neurons are not PAC neurons\n\nAlthough the above results indicate a relationship between category neurons\nand PAC within the hippocampus, they alone do not definitively demonstrate\nthat the spiking activity of category neurons was sensitive to the nonlinear\ninteraction between theta-phase and gamma amplitude as would be expected from\nPAC. Thus, we next selected for MTL neurons whose activity was modulated by\nPAC and determined whether they significantly overlapped with the persistently\nactive category neurons. We defined PAC neurons as neurons whose FR was a\nfunction of the interaction between theta-phase and gamma amplitude (Methods;\nan example is shown in Fig. 4). In the hippocampus, 79 (37.29%) out of 212\navailable neurons (P < 0.005; 200 permutations (Methods); pre-processing steps\nremoved broadband LFPs for some of the neurons and those were therefore not\npart of this analysis) qualified as PAC neurons. In the amygdala, 163 (45.53%)\nout of 358 neurons (P < 0.005) qualified as PAC neurons.\n\nFig. 4: PAC neuron selection and local activity.\n\na, The binning used for PAC neuron selection for an example hippocampal\nneuron. Theta phase, binned into ten groups, and gamma amplitude (amp.),\nmedian split into low and high, were used to predict the spike counts of each\nneuron from the MTL during the delay. The spike count was higher during high-\ngamma amplitudes (gamma main effect) and differed in their theta phase\ndistribution between high and low gamma amplitudes (interaction effect),\nresulting in selecting this neuron as a PAC neuron. b, The proportions of\nneurons qualifying as PAC neurons. Cat., category. c,d, FRs of PAC neurons\nwere positively correlated with single-trial estimates of TG-PAC in the\nhippocampus (c; n = 79, P = 0.028, mixed-effects GLM), but not in the amygdala\n(d; n = 163, P = 0.98; GLM results are shown in Supplementary Table 4). e,f,\nFRs of PAC neurons during the maintenance period differed between correct and\nincorrect trials in the hippocampus (e; n = 63; correct versus baseline, P =\n0.01; incorrect, P = 0.33; correct \u2212 incorrect, P = 0.0001; 16 neurons were\nexcluded due to insufficient data in the incorrect condition), but not in the\namygdala (f; n = 156; correct, P = 0.0001; incorrect, P = 0.0001; correct \u2212\nincorrect, P = 0.45; 7 were neurons excluded due to insufficient data in the\nincorrect condition). FRs are shown as the percentage change compared with the\nbaseline (\u22120.9 to \u22120.3 s). g,h, FRs did not differ between loads (hippocampus\n(g): n = 79; load 1, P = 0.03; load 3, P = 0.01; load 3 \u2212 load 1, P = 0.20;\namygdala (h): n = 163; load 1, P = 0.0001; load 3, P = 0.0001; load 3 \u2212 load\n1, P = 0.80). For g\u2013j, statistical analysis was performed using two-sided\npermutation-based t-tests. For e\u2013j, data are mean \u00b1 s.e.m.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe next examined whether the selected PAC neurons were also category neurons.\nIn the hippocampus, 28 (35.44%) out of the 79 PAC neurons were both PAC\nneurons as well as category neurons. In the amygdala, this was the case for 68\n(41.72%) out of the 163 PAC neurons (Fig. 4b). The proportion of category\nneurons among PAC neurons was not significantly higher than expected by\nindependent subpopulations in any of the two regions (both P > 0.05; Methods).\nTo further corroborate this finding, we trained a linear decoder to\ndifferentiate between the five different picture categories based on the FRs\nextracted during picture presentation (encoding). As expected, the decoder was\nable to differentiate between the picture categories when it was trained on\nFRs from the category neurons (hippocampus, 72.77%, P = 0.001; amygdala,\n88.71%, P = 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 7a). However, the decoder could not\ndifferentiate between the categories when it was trained on FRs from PAC\nneurons that were not also category neurons in both MTL areas (hippocampus,\n26.06%, P = 0.16; amygdala, 25.86%, P = 0.15; chance level = 20%). In summary,\nthe probabilities of a neuron being a PAC or a category neuron were\nindependent and the activity of PAC neurons did not differ between the\ncategory of the presented stimuli.\n\n## Properties of PAC neurons\n\nWe next investigated whether PAC neuron activity was related to WM maintenance\nin ways other than persistent activity. We identified three such relationships\nfor PAC neurons in the hippocampus. First, FRs of PAC neurons were positively\ncorrelated with estimates of single-trial PAC (Methods and Supplementary Table\n4; Fig. 4c,d shows univariate correlation coefficients for illustration).\nSecond, their FR was elevated throughout the maintenance period compared with\nthe baseline (t_78 = 2.43, P = 0.01). Third, FRs varied as a function of\naccuracy (correct versus incorrect trials (t_62 = 3.82, P < 0.001; Fig. 4e; 16\nneurons were excluded from this comparison due to insufficient data in the\nincorrect condition), and were elevated as compared to the baseline in correct\ntrials (t_62 = 2.67, P = 0.01) but not in incorrect trials (t_62 = \u22120.98, P =\n0.33). FRs were not significantly different between the two load conditions\n(load 3 \u2212 load 1, t_78 = 1.38, P = 0.20), but FRs were elevated compared with\nthe baseline in each condition considered separately (load 1, t_78 = 2.14, P =\n0.03; load 3, t_78 = 2.45, P = 0.01; Fig. 4g; similar results concerning theta\nand gamma SFC are shown in Extended Data Fig. 7b). PAC neurons did not show a\nload-dependent shift in preferred theta phase (Extended Data Fig. 7d), or\nsignificant FR differences between fast and slow RT trials (t_78 = \u22120.07, P =\n0.94). By contrast, in the amygdala, FRs of PAC neurons were not significantly\ncorrelated with single-trial estimates of TG-PAC (Fig. 4d and Supplementary\nTable 4). PAC neurons in the amygdala also showed higher FRs during the\nmaintenance period compared with the baseline (t_162 = 6.40, P < 0.001), but\nthere were no significant differences between correct and incorrect WM trials\n(t_156 = \u22120.77, P = 0.45; Fig. 4f), loads (load 3 \u2212 load 1, t_162 = 0.26, P =\n0.80; Fig. 4h; SFC and phase shift results in the amygdala are shown in\nExtended Data Fig. 7c,d) or fast and slow RT trials (t_162 = 1.87, P = 0.07).\nThus, hippocampal PAC neurons, despite not being tuned to WM content, were\nengaged in WM maintenance because their FRs were elevated during WM\nmaintenance and differed as a function of behavioural accuracy.\n\n## PAC neurons phase lock to the frontal cortex\n\nGiven the properties of PAC neurons shown above, we hypothesized that PAC\nneurons might be involved in cognitive control of WM. We therefore next\nexamined whether the activity of PAC neurons is related to frontal\nactivity^34. To do so, we computed cross-regional SFC between spiking activity\nof PAC neurons in the MTL and the LFPs recorded in the pre-SMA, dACC and vmPFC\n(Fig. 5a). If PAC neuron activity is related to frontal cognitive control, we\nexpected cross-regional SFC in the theta range to be stronger in load 3 than\nin load 1 trials. The data support this hypothesis\u2014SFC was significantly\nstronger in load 3 compared with load 1 between spiking activity of PAC\nneurons in the hippocampus and theta-band LFPs recorded in the vmPFC (Fig. 5b\nand Methods; cluster P < 0.001). We did not observe significant differences\nfor other frequency bands, nor for the other two frontal brain areas (see\nExtended Data Fig. 8a\u2013h for narrow versus broad-spiking neurons, patient-level\nstatistics, load comparisons for within-vmPFC and cross-regional SFC between\nvmPFC LFPs and hippocampal spiking, as well as comparisons of non-specific\nglobal changes). Repeating the same analysis for category neurons did not\nreveal significant differences in SFC strength (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig.\n8c). Furthermore, the difference in SFC strength between the two load\nconditions for random subsets of hippocampal neurons (the same number of\nconnections as for PAC neurons) was smaller for all tested 10,000 combinations\ncompared with that for hippocampal PAC neurons (P = 0.0001; Fig. 5e). Lastly,\nPAC neurons from the amygdala did not show significant cross-regional SFC\ndifferences in any of the tested frequencies (Fig. 5d) or regions. We further\nhypothesized that, if theta-band cross-regional SFC indeed reflects levels of\ncognitive control, it should be stronger for faster RTs. This was the\ncase\u2014theta SFC was stronger for fast compared with slow RTs for PAC neurons\nfrom the hippocampus (t_166 = 2.10, P = 0.03; Fig. 5f), but not from the\namygdala (t_705 = 1.40, P = 0.16). Thus, we conclude that the theta-band phase\nlocking of PAC neurons in the hippocampus to the vmPFC is related to cognitive\ncontrol.\n\nFig. 5: Remote connectivity of PAC neurons in the MTL to frontal theta LFPs.\n\na, Long-range SFC between MTL spiking activity and LFPs recorded from all\nthree frontal regions. The slices (https://osf.io/r2hvk/) were obtained under\na Creative Commons licence CC BY 4.0. b, Spikes of hippocampal PAC neurons\nwere more strongly synchronized with theta-band LFPs recorded in the vmPFC\nduring the maintenance period during load 3 compared with load 1 trials (n =\n175 connections; cluster P = 0.0001). This was not the case for the pre-SMA\nand dACC (Extended Data Fig. 8). c,d, Category neurons from the hippocampus\n(c; n = 215) or PAC neurons from the amygdala (d; n = 767) did not show\nsignificant SFC differences between loads relative to the vmPFC LFP. For b\u2013d,\nstatistical analysis was performed using two-sided cluster-based permutation\nt-tests with a Bonferroni-corrected alpha-level for two MTL areas, three\nfrontal areas and two cell populations. e, Hippocampal PAC cells (n = 175,\ncyan line) yielded the strongest long-range theta SFC difference between load\n3 and load 1 trials among 10,000 random selections of hippocampus\u2013vmPFC\nconnections (P = 0.0001, right-sided permutation test). t values correspond to\ncomparisons between load 3 and load 1 trials for an average of SFC values in\nthe significant theta range (2.5\u20134.3 Hz). For b\u2013d, data are mean (centre line)\n\u00b1 s.e.m. (coloured areas). f, The remote theta-band SFC between spiking\nactivity of PAC neurons and LFPs recorded in the vmPFC was significantly\nstronger for fast compared with slow RT trials (P = 0.03, two-sided\npermutation-based t-test).

A, amygdala; H, hippocampus.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Information-enhancing noise correlations\n\nCells that by themselves carry no information in their FR can influence the\nrepresentation of a variable at the population level if their activity is\ncorrelated with other cells^35,36. We hypothesized that PAC neurons might have\nthis role during WM maintenance. In both the hippocampus (162 pairs; t_161 =\n5.26; P < 0.001) and the amygdala (892 pairs; t_891 = 15.51; P < 0.001), pairs\nof category neurons and PAC neurons had on average positive co-fluctuations of\nspike counts (Fig. 6a (left); see Extended Data Fig. 9a for amygdala). As a\ncontrol, we shuffled trials within conditions to remove noise correlations\nwhile leaving all other properties of the signal intact, including common\ncategory-related input, interspike-interval distributions, FR distributions\nand temporal relations to task events (Methods). The correlation coefficients\nacross all PAC and category neuron pairs were significantly greater than the\nsame correlations computed after shuffling trials this way (see Fig. 6a\n(right) for hippocampal pairs; noise correlations computed across trials are\nshown in Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013d). This was also true for correlations among\npairs of category neurons and PAC neurons that were not also category neurons\n(Extended Data Fig. 9e,f).\n\nFig. 6: Noise correlations of PAC neurons in the hippocampus.\n\na, The mean correlation for all category\u2013PAC neuron pairs was positive (n =\n162, P = 0.0001) (left). Right, the mean correlation was larger than the null\ndistribution of mean correlations without noise correlations (P = 0.001,\nright-sided permutation test). b, The decoding accuracy for category from FR\nin the maintenance period with intact or removed noise correlations for an\nexample session. The white dots signify accuracy, and the coloured dots\nindicate the identity for each neuron. Indiv., individual. c, Adding single\nPAC neurons to the ensemble with intact noise correlations increased the\ndecoding accuracy (n = 21; intact, P = 0.0007; removed, P = 0.91; intact \u2212\nremoved, P = 0.003). d, Removing PAC neurons reduced decodability with intact\nnoise correlations only (n = 22 sessions; intact, P = 0.004; removed, P =\n0.20). Removing non-PAC neurons decreased decoding for intact (P = 0.010) and\nremoved (P = 0.0001) correlations. e, The decoding difference with and without\nnoise correlations was lower only when PAC neurons were removed (n = 22\nsessions; PAC, P = 0.0007; non-PAC, P = 0.10). f, The signal\u2013noise axis for\nsimulated tuned (neuron 1) and untuned (neuron 2) neurons. The signal\u2013noise\naxis angle is reduced without noise correlations. g, The signal\u2013noise angle in\nthe data was reduced after removing noise correlations (n = 32 sessions, P =\n0.009). h, The variance along the signal axis was reduced when noise\ncorrelations were intact only when PAC neurons were present (n = 19 sessions,\nP = 0.014; main effect ensemble: P = 0.0013; permutation-based F-test). i,\nCorrelations of PAC\u2013category pairs (n = 162) were stronger in fast (P =\n0.0001) compared with slow (P = 0.06; median split; fast \u2212 slow, P = 0.028;\npreferred category trials only) RT trials. This effect was significant in load\n3 (P = 0.009) but not in load 1 (P = 0.34) trials. j, The PAC\u2013category pair\ncorrelation difference between fast and slow RT trials was larger than for\nrandom non-PAC\u2013category pairs (P = 0.016, right-sided permutation test). For\na,c\u2013e,g\u2013i, statistical analysis was performed using two-sided permutation-\nbased t-tests. Data are mean \u00b1 s.e.m.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe next examined whether PAC neurons contributed to the decodability of image\ncategory during WM maintenance at the population level. We iteratively added\nneurons to the population through greedy selection of the neuron that adds\nmost decodability above and beyond that provided by the already included\nneurons (Methods; see Fig. 6b for an example from a single session for neurons\nup to peak decodability). In the hippocampus, adding single PAC neurons to the\noptimized decoding ensemble significantly enhanced category decoding when\nnoise correlations were intact (t_20 = 3.16, P < 0.001) but not when they were\nremoved (t_20 = \u22120.12, P = 0.91, BF_01 = 4.37; intact versus removed, t_20 =\n3.33, P = 0.003; Fig. 6c). This suggests that specifically the noise\ncorrelations of PAC neurons enhanced the decodability of category information,\nnot their category-related FRs per se.\n\nWe next compared the maximal decoding performance for intact and removed noise\ncorrelations before and after all PAC neurons were removed from the ensembles.\nPAC neurons enhanced the decodability of category, but only when noise\ncorrelations were intact (t_21 = 2.94; P = 0.004; FDR corrected for all\ncomparisons; Fig. 6d). Removing PAC neurons from the ensemble after noise\ncorrelations were removed did not significantly change the decoding\nperformance (t_21 = 1.36, P = 0.20; Fig. 6d (red)). The decoding performance\ndropped to a similar extent when only removing PAC neurons that were not also\ncategory neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9g). Together, this pattern of results\nsuggests that the decrease in decoding performance was not caused by removing\nPAC neurons that also carried category information. Rather, dropping neurons\nthat were modulated by PAC from the ensemble led to a reduction in decoding\naccuracy. In accordance with these results, the maximal differences between\nintact and removed noise correlations were larger when PAC neurons were part\nof the ensembles as compared to being removed (t_21 = 3.59, P < 0.001; Fig.\n6e).\n\nTo assess the specificity of those results, we repeated the above analysis\nafter removing randomly chosen neurons that were not PAC neurons from the\nensembles (Fig. 6d (without non-PAC); averaged over 500 random selections; the\nsame number as for PAC neurons in each session). This revealed that removing\nnon-PAC neurons in the ensembles without noise correlations led to further\ndecreases of decoding performance (t_21 = 3.89; P < 0.001), thereby indicating\nthat non-PAC neurons contributed information to the population that did not\ndepend on noise correlations. Accordingly, we did not find a significant\ndifference when comparing the maximal decoding difference between intact and\nremoved noise correlations for ensembles for which we removed randomly\nselected non-PAC neurons (t_21 = \u22121.77, P = 0.10; Fig. 6e). In contrast to in\nthe hippocampus, in the amygdala, PAC neurons contributed to category\ndecodability not only when noise correlations were intact but also when noise\ncorrelations were removed; Extended Data Fig. 9j,k).\n\nWe quantified geometric features of the data manifold to determine why noise\ncorrelations enhanced decodability of WM content. We quantified the angle\nbetween the two vectors that describe the signal and the noise axis in the\nn-dimensional space formed by the n simultaneously recorded neurons in a given\nsession. Whether noise correlations are information limiting or enhancing\ndepends on this angle^37. As noise correlations are information enhancing in\nour case, we hypothesized that the angle between the signal and the noise axes\nshould (1) be relatively large to begin with; and (2) increase when noise\ncorrelations are present compared with when they are absent (Fig. 6f). This\nwas the case\u2014when noise correlations were intact, the signal\u2013noise axis angle\nwas around 69\u00b0 (out of maximally 90\u00b0). After removing noise correlations, this\nangle became significantly smaller, as hypothesized (t_31 = 2.77, P = 0.009;\nFig. 6g).\n\nWe examined the variance of the signal projected onto the signal axis^38 in\npopulations with and without PAC neurons present to examine whether noise\ncorrelations are related to PAC. Removing PAC neurons from the ensembles\nsignificantly increased the s.d. of the projection values (main effect for\nensemble, F_1,18 = 12.55, P = 0.0013; Fig. 6h). Moreover, the s.d. of the\nprojected values was larger when noise correlations were removed (main effect\nfor noise correlations, F_1,18 = 7.24, P = 0.014). This was only the case if\nPAC neurons were part of the ensembles (t_18 = \u22122.66, P = 0.014), and there\nwas no significant difference between intact and removed noise correlations\nwhen PAC neurons were removed (t_18 = \u22121.69, P = 0.11). These findings suggest\nthat specifically the noise correlations introduced by PAC neurons affected\nthe geometry of the population code.\n\nIf noise correlations are beneficial to WM, they should be stronger in correct\nfast RT trials as compared to correct slow RT trials, specifically when\ncategory neurons\u2019 preferred categories were maintained in WM. In the\nhippocampus, noise correlations were significantly stronger for fast compared\nwith slow RT trials (t_161 = 2.15, P = 0.028; Fig. 6i (left); patient-level\nresults are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9h) for pairs of PAC\u2013category cells in\ntrials in which the preferred stimulus of the category cell in the pair was\nmaintained in WM (Methods). Noise correlations were on average significantly\npositive only in fast trials (t_161 = 4.10, P < 0.001) but not in slow trials\n(t_161 = 1.94, P = 0.06). For non-preferred trials, we did not observe a\nsignificant difference between fast and slow RT trials (Extended Data Fig.\n9h). Separating trials into the two load conditions, we observed a significant\ndifference only between fast and slow trials in load 3 (t_161 = 2.60, P =\n0.009; Fig. 6i (right)), but not in load 1 (t_161 = 0.96, P = 0.34; Fig. 6i\n(middle)). In the amygdala, comparing fast to slow RT trials in preferred\ntrials did not reveal a significant difference (Extended Data Fig. 9l).\nLastly, we examined whether the effect of noise correlations on RTs in the\nhippocampus was specific to PAC-to-category neuron pairs or a common feature\nacross the entire population of simultaneously recorded neurons. PAC-to-\ncategory neuron pairs showed a significantly stronger effect compared with\nmost randomly selected cell pairs (P = 0.016; Fig. 6j), showing that noise\ncorrelations between category and PAC neurons within the hippocampus\ncontributed to enhanced WM fidelity.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAlthough TG-PAC is ubiquitous at the electroencephalogram and LFP level, it\nhas remained unclear how PAC is reflected at the single-neuron level. We find\nthat TG-PAC has a direct relationship to the spiking activity of individual\nneurons. However, while by definition PAC neurons were related to local gamma\nactivity, they were not directly involved in the processing of the memoranda\nheld in WM per se. Rather, their activity was coordinated with frontal theta,\nwith stronger phase locking for higher WM load and faster RTs. This finding\nindicates that PAC neurons have a role in cognitive control.\n\nLong-range theta phase locking between frontal and temporal/occipital areas\nhas been suggested to reflect frontal cognitive control exerted over task-\nrelevant brain processes^29,30,39. In WM maintenance, frontotemporal\ninteractions are crucial, especially when involving the\nhippocampus^31,32,40,41,42,43. Theta-based prefrontal coordination of\nposterior WM content-specific processes could ensure efficient information\nprocessing at phases that are optimal for network-wide communication within\nthe memoranda-processing population of neurons^30,44. According to this model,\nhigher levels of cognitive control are indicated by stronger phase locking\nbetween regions to facilitate faster and more efficient readout of WM content.\nOur results support this model and provide evidence for a specific mechanism\nto implement it. SFC between hippocampal PAC neurons and vmPFC theta was\nstronger in periods in which more cognitive control was required. Cross-\nregional hippocampus\u2013vmPFC SFC was enhanced for fast compared with slow RT\ntrials, suggesting that a more efficient interaction between distant areas\nmight lead to a behaviourally beneficial read-out of WM content with stronger\nlevels of control.\n\nThe goal of successful cognitive control is to increase the fidelity of the\nretained memories. Here we show that one way PAC neurons contributed to\nachieving this goal is by introducing noise correlations that enhance\ninformation content at the population level. Noise correlations are a\npopulation phenomenon and are therefore not expected to occur only between\nspecific subpopulations of neurons. However, our results show that the noise\ncorrelations of PAC neurons with other neurons predicted behaviour better than\npairs not involving PAC neurons. Although the numerical strength of the\npairwise noise correlations between single pairs of neurons was low (as\nexpected^45), noise correlations of this magnitude can have large effects at\nthe population level^46,47. Noise correlations are typically thought to be\ninformation limiting^48,49, but theoretical work shows that this is not always\nthe case^35,50,51,52. Rather, in our case, noise correlations of PAC neurons\nshaped the geometry of stimulus category information such that decodability of\nWM content improved. That is, noise correlations were information enhancing.\nThese decodability enhancements were abolished when noise correlations among\nneurons were removed. By contrast, although non-PAC neurons also improved\ndecoding accuracy, these improvements were not due to noise correlations\nbecause decoding improvement did not change when noise correlations were\nremoved. Geometrically, the effect of PAC neurons was to increase the angle\nbetween the signal and the noise axis, which improved the read-out of encoded\nWM content and enhanced the fidelity of WM memoranda representations.\n\nTaken together, our results are in agreement with a multicomponent view of\nWM^1,2, whereby frontal control processes regulate and manage maintenance of\nWM content in storage-related areas such as the hippocampus^3,4,5,14. This\ninterplay between the control and processing of WM content was revealed by\njointly analysing the activity of both PAC and category neurons. PAC neurons\nare a single-cell correlate of the widespread macro-scale phenomena of TG-PAC.\nThey mediate interareal interactions that have a role in cognitive control and\nshape WM fidelity through noise correlations with information-carrying,\npersistently active category neurons, with stronger interactions in trials\nwith successful control. PAC-mediated interareal interactions might serve as a\ngeneral mechanism for top-down control to influence bottom-up processes, a\nhypothesis that we confirm here for WM, but that remains to be tested for\nother high-level cognitive functions involving top-down control from frontal\nregions such as attention^53, decision making^54,55, speech comprehension^56\nand long-term memory retrieval^34.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Patients\n\nA total of 36 patients (44 sessions; 21 female individuals; 15 male\nindividuals; age: 40.47 \u00b1 13.76 years; Supplementary Table 5; no statistical\nmethods were used to predetermine sample sizes) participated in the study. All\nof the patients had Behnke\u2013Fried hybrid electrodes (AdTech) implanted for\nintracranial seizure monitoring and evaluation for surgical treatment of drug-\nresistant epilepsy. Their participation was voluntary, and all of the patients\ngave their informed consent. This study was part of an NIH Brain consortium\nbetween three institutions (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Toronto Western\nHospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital) and was approved by the Institutional\nReview Board of the institution at which the patient was enrolled. A pre-\noperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image together with MRI or computed\ntomography post-operative images were used to localize the electrodes using\nFreesurfer as previously described^34. Electrode positions are plotted on the\nCITI168 Atlas Brain^57 in MNI152 coordinates for the sole purpose of\nvisualization (Fig. 1b). The 3D plot was generated using FieldTrip\n(v.20200409) and the Brainnetome Atlas^58. Coordinates appearing in white\nmatter or outside of the target area is due to usage of a template brain.\nElectrodes that were localized outside of the target area in native space were\nexcluded from analysis (8 out of a total of 265 recording sites). Data used in\nthis study are available in the DANDI archive^59.\n\n### Task\n\nThe task consists of 140 trials and 280 novel pictures. Each trial started\nwith a fixation cross presented for 0.9 to 1.2 s (Fig. 1a). Depending on the\nload condition, the fixation cross was followed by either one (load 1; 70\ntrials) or three (load 3; 70 trials) consecutively presented pictures, each\nremaining on the screen for 2 s. In load 3 trials, pictures were separated by\na blank screen randomly shown for 17 to 200 ms. Picture presentation was\nfollowed by a 2.55 to 2.85 s long maintenance period in which only the word\n\u201cHOLD\u201d was presented on the screen. The maintenance period was terminated by\nthe presentation of a probe picture, which was either one of the pictures\nshown earlier in the trial (match) or a picture already presented in one of\nthe previous trials (non-match; see below). The task was to indicate whether\nthe probe picture matched on of the pictures shown earlier in the same trial\nor not. The probe picture was shown until the patients provided their response\nthrough a button press. The response mapping switched after half the trials,\nwhich was communicated to patients during a short half-time break. Responses\nwere provided using a Cedrus response pad (RB-844; Cedrus). All of the\npictures were novel (that is, the patient had never seen this particular\nimage) and were drawn from five different visual categories: faces, animals,\ncars (or tools depending on the version), fruits and landscapes. Images (width\n\u00d7 height: 10.5 \u00d7 7 visual degrees) were presented in the centre of the screen\nand never more than twice (that is, when serving as the probe picture).\nPictures were only repeated when presented as the probe stimulus. To make sure\nthat also the non-match probe pictures were never completely new to patients\n(as were the matching probe pictures), which could have been used as a\nstrategy to solve the task without using WM, we always used a picture that the\npatients had seen already in one of the earlier trials, randomly drawn from\none of the categories not used during encoding. If a patient participated in\nmore than one session, we used a completely new set of pictures in each\nsession to ensure that all pictures were novel in all of the sessions. The\noverall longer duration of load 3 as compared to load 1 trials ensured\nincreased cognitive control demands in trials with higher load. The\nmaintenance period was the same length regardless of load, and all analysis of\nneural activity during the maintenance period was performed within this time\nwindow (0\u20132.5 s after the maintenance period onset). Note that, in load 3\ntrials, the three encoded items were from three different categories, assuring\nthat the participants always had to maintain pictures from three different\ncategories. Thus, when comparing trials between load 1 and 3 for preferred\ntrials, each load condition always contained exactly one item from the\npreferred category.\n\n### Spike sorting\n\nEach hybrid depth electrode contained eight microwires from which we recorded\nthe broadband LFP signal between 0.1 and 8,000 Hz at a sampling rate of 32 kHz\n(ATLAS system, Neuralynx; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Toronto Western\nHospital) or 30 kHz (Blackrock Neurotech; Johns Hopkins Hospital) depending on\nthe institution. All recordings were locally referenced within each recording\nsite by using either one of the eight available micro channels or a dedicated\nreference channel with lower impedance provided in the bundle, especially when\nall channels contained recordings of neuronal spiking. To detect and sort\nspikes from putative single neurons in each wire, we used the semiautomated\ntemplate-matching algorithm OSort (v.4.1)^60. Spikes were detected after band-\npass filtering the raw signal in the 300\u20133,000 Hz band (single-cell quality\nmetrics are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1). All analysis in this paper\n(including the LFP) is based on signals recorded from micro wires. We isolated\n360 neurons in the hippocampus, 496 in the amygdala, 204 in the pre-SMA, 188\nin the dACC and 206 in the vmPFC. Of the LFP channels, 586 channels were in\nthe hippocampus, 421 in the amygdala, 283 in the pre-SMA, 325 in the dACC and\n307 in the vmPFC.\n\n### LFP preprocessing\n\nBefore analysing the LFPs, we removed spike waveforms (action potentials) and\nexcluded trials with interictal discharges and high-amplitude noise. First, to\navoid leakage of spiking activity into lower frequency ranges^61,62, we\nremoved the waveforms of detected spikes from the raw signal by linear\ninterpolating the raw data from \u22121 to 2 ms around each spike onset in the raw\nrecording before downsampling. As the same spike can, in rare instances, be\nrecorded on more than one wire, we not only interpolated the data for the wire\non which the neuron was detected but also for all other wires in the same wire\nbundle. We then low-pass filtered the raw signal using a zero phase-lag filter\nat 175 Hz and downsampled to 400 Hz. Line noise was then removed between 59.5\nand 60.5 Hz as well as between 119.5 and 120.5 Hz using zero phase-lag band-\nstop filters. Extended Data Fig. 1f,g shows the raw LFP as well as the log\u2013log\npower spectrum for an example channel from the hippocampus. The slope of\nlog\u2013log power spectra did not differ significantly between load 1 and load 3\ntrials in hippocampal channels (n = 586 channels; mean slope \u22121.7526 \u00b1 0.3902\nversus \u22121.7517 \u00b1 0.3928, t_585 = \u22120.86, P = 0.39).\n\nArtefact and inter-ictal discharge detection was performed on a per trial and\nwire basis using a semiautomated algorithm together with subsequent visual\ninspection of the data. To detect high-amplitude noise events as well as\ninter-ictal discharges, we z-scored the amplitude in each channel across all\ntrials. To avoid artefactual amplitude biasing, we first capped the data at 6\ns.d. from the mean and re-performed the z-scoring on the capped data^63,64. If\na single time sample in each trial and wire exceeded a threshold of 4 s.d.,\nthe trial was removed from the analysis for that wire. Jumps in the signal\nwere detected by z-scoring the difference between every fourth sample of the\ncapped signal. Trials in which any jump exceeded a z-score of 10 s.d. were\nremoved. The result of this cleaning process was visually inspected in every\nrecording and any remaining artefactual trials were removed manually. If a\nwire or brain region showed excessive noise or epileptic activity, it was\nentirely removed from the analysis. On average, 20.4 \u00b1 13.9 trials (14.6% of\nthe data) were removed per wire.\n\n### PAC\n\nWe measured the strength of PAC for a wide set of frequency combinations in\nall of the recorded micro channels (except those excluded, see above) using\nthe modulation index (MI) as introduced previously^65. As the cleaning process\ndescribed above produced a different set of available trials for each channel,\nwe first randomly subsampled from all correct trials in each channel such that\nthe number of trials were the same for both load 1 and load 3. We then\nextracted the LFP starting at \u2212500 until 3,000 ms following the maintenance\nperiod onset in each selected trial. We then filtered (using pop_eegfiltnew.m\nfrom EEGLAB, v.2019.1)^66 each trial separately within the respective\nfrequency bands of interest (see below for more details). We then extracted\nthe instantaneous phase from the lower-frequency signal and the amplitude from\nthe higher-frequency signal using the Hilbert transform. Lastly, we cut each\ntrial to the final time window of interest of 0\u20132,500 ms relative to\nmaintenance period onset. This last step ensures that filter artefacts that\narise at the edges of the signal are removed. All analysis of neural activity\nduring the maintenance period was performed in this 2.5-s-long time window\nthat started at the onset of the maintenance period. The length of the\nanalysis window was the same in both load conditions. Next, we concatenated\nthe phase and the amplitude signal across trials and computed the MI as\ndescribed previously^65 (18 phase bins). We computed MIs separately for load 1\nand load 3 trials. All subsampled trials from both load conditions were used\nto select for significant PAC channels in an unbiased fashion (see below).\nExample code to reproduce parts of the results in this study in published at\nZenodo^67.\n\nTo standardize the MI in each channel, frequency and condition, we computed\n200 surrogate MIs by randomly combining the phase and amplitude signals from\ndifferent trials (trial-shuffling), again separately for load 1, load 3 and\nfor all trials. We fit a normal distribution to these surrogate data\n(normfit.m) to obtain the mean and s.d. of each distribution. These values\nwere then used to z-transform the raw MI values. Standardizing MI values\neliminates potential systematic differences that might arise due to load-\nrelated power or phase differences, which could drive observed differences in\nPAC. Moreover, low frequencies are more vulnerable to non-specific\ncorrelations to high-frequency power due to non-stationarities in the LFP\nsignal caused by factors such phase resets. Comparing raw modulation indices\nto trial-shuffled surrogates within the same condition will reduce PAC that is\ncaused by such non-specific interactions (discussed in detail previously^68).\nIn addition to providing a measure of significance, normalizing the MI values\ntherefore allows for comparisons across conditions, frequencies and\nchannels^69. A channel was indicated as having significant PAC present if the\nnormalized MI computed across all subsampled trials (both loads) exceeded a\nz-score of 1.64 (P < 0.05, right-sided).\n\nWe repeated the above procedure for all frequency combinations. The phase\nsignals were extracted for centre frequencies between 2 and 14 Hz in steps of\n2 Hz (2 Hz fixed bandwidth). The amplitude signals were extracted for\nfrequencies between 30 and 150 Hz in steps of 5 Hz. The bandwidth of the\namplitude signals was variable and depended on the centre frequency of the\nlow-frequency signal. It was chosen such that it constituted twice the centre\nfrequency of the phase signal (for example, if combined with an 8 Hz centre\nfrequency for the phase signal, the bandwidth of the amplitude signal was\nchosen to be 16 Hz). This procedure ensures that the side peaks that arise if\nthe amplitude signal is modulated by a lower-frequency phase signal are\nincluded^68.\n\nTo determine the influence of theta waveform shape on PAC, we tested for\ndifferences in theta waveform peak-to-trough as well as rise-to-decay\nasymmetries between the two load conditions, which could potentially cause\ndifferences in TG-PAC^70,71. To extract and characterize each theta cycle\nduring the delay period in all significant hippocampal PAC channels, we used\nthe bycycle toolbox^72 in Python. We averaged estimates for peak-to-trough as\nwell as rise-to-decay asymmetries across cycles during the maintenance period\nfrom the same trials used for our PAC analysis within each load and tested the\nestimates between the conditions. Results of this analysis are presented in\nExtended Data Fig. 3c.\n\nMoreover, we determined the number of significant PAC channels that showed\ntheta\u2013high-gamma nesting using the method described previously^69. To do so,\nin each PAC channel we determined the theta phase bin for which gamma\namplitude was maximal, that is, the preferred theta phase of gamma amplitude.\nIn the band-pass-filtered and phase-binned theta (3\u20137 Hz) signal, we then\ndetermined all instances during the delay periods of all of the correct trials\nin which this phase bin occurred, and extracted the precise timepoint at which\nthe concurrent instantaneous gamma amplitude (70\u2013140 Hz) was maximal within\neach bin. To obtain the average waveform, we selected a window of 500 ms\ncentred on each timepoint in the raw (unfiltered) LFP recording and averaged\nthe signals across all windows in each channel. Example average waveforms from\ntwo channels are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3e. In accordance with ref. ^69,\nwe characterized a waveform as being nested if at least three local maxima\nfell within a window of 45 ms (that is, 3 cycles at 70 Hz) around the\npreferred phase. Results are presented in Extended Data Fig. 3e.\n\n### Relationship between single-trial PAC and FR or RT\n\nWe calculated single-trial estimates of TG-PAC for all significant PAC\nchannels of both MTL regions and the vmPFC. We used mixed-effect GLMs to\nassess whether RT is related to PAC in a trial-by-trial manner (using only\ncorrect trials). We included load as a confounder and modelled random\nintercepts for each significant PAC channel nested into patientID. To examine\nwhether there was a correlation between FR of category neurons (see below) and\nsingle-trial estimates of PAC, we used a mixed-effects GLM with load as a\nconfounder and modelled random intercepts for each neuron to significant PAC\nchannel combination. Only correct trials were used.\n\n### Category cell selection\n\nWe selected for neurons of which the response after stimulus onset during\nencoding differed systematically between the picture categories of the stimuli\nshown. To do so, for each trial, we counted the number of spikes a neuron\nfired in a window between 200 to 1,000 ms after stimulus onset (all encoding\nperiods and the probe period). We then grouped spike counts based on the\ncategory of the picture shown in that trial. For each neuron, we computed a 1\n\u00d7 5 permutation-based analysis of variance (ANOVA) with visual category as the\ngrouping variable, followed by a post hoc one-sided permutation-based t-test\nbetween the category with maximum spike count and all other categories. We\nclassified a given neuron as a category neuron if both tests were significant\n(P < 0.05, 2,000 permutations (see below)). We refer to the category with the\nmaximum FR as the preferred category of a cell. To test whether the observed\nnumber of category cells was significantly larger than that expected by chance\nin each area, we repeated the above selection for 500 times after shuffling\nthe category labels for each stimulus across all picture presentations. If the\nobserved number of category cells in the unshuffled data was higher than the\n99th percentile (P < 0.01) of the resulting shuffled distribution (which,\nacross all five brain areas, corresponds to a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level\nof 0.05), we considered the number of category cells observed in a given area\nas significant. Note that category cells are selected only using spiking\nactivity from the encoding period, leaving the FRs during the maintenance\nperiod independent for later analyses.\n\n### SFC\n\nTo measure how strongly the spiking activity of a neuron followed the phase of\nan LFP in a certain frequency, we computed the SFC. We measured SFC as the\nmean vector length (MVL) across spike-phases for all neuron-to-channel\ncombinations available within a bundle or across regions (within the same\nhemisphere) in correct trials^73. To estimate the instantaneous phase from\nLFPs in different frequency ranges in each trial, we applied continuous\nwavelet transforms using 40 complex Morlet wavelets^74 spanning from 2 to 150\nHz in logarithmic steps. The number of cycles for each wavelet changed as a\nfunction of frequency from 3 to 10 cycles, also in 40 logarithmic steps^75.\nThis ensured a higher temporal precision for longer wavelets at low\nfrequencies and higher frequency precision for faster wavelets at high\nfrequencies as compared to using a constant number of cycles across all\nfrequencies^76. Extended Data Figure 1 shows the temporal and spectral\ncharacteristics across all wavelets used in this analysis. To assess the\nquality of our wavelet transform, we tested how well we were able to\nreconstruct the original signal after applying the wavelets to our data. To\nreconstruct the signal, we extracted the real-valued (bandpass-filtered)\nsignal after applying each wavelet to the data and then summed up these\nsignals across all frequencies. This resulted in a signal that closely\nfollowed the original recording in each trial (an example trial is shown in\nExtended Data Fig. 1j). We assessed how well the reconstructed signal\npredicted the original signal by computing R^2 values extracted from linear\nmodels using the reconstructed signal as predictors and the original signal as\nresponse variables in each trial and channel. As the quality of the\nreconstruction could change as a function of frequency or time, we performed\nthis analysis for several time and frequency bins. First, we band-pass\nfiltered both signals within the spectral bandwidth of each wavelet and then\napplied the linear model in sliding windows of 500 ms with a step size of 25\nms. The results of this analysis are presented in Extended Data Fig. 1.\n\nFor our SFC analysis, we first extracted data between \u2212500 and 3,000 ms around\nthe maintenance period onset from all clean trials in each channel and then\ncomputed a complex Morlet wavelet convolution to extract the instantaneous\nphase of the LFP as described above. The trials were then cut to the final\ntime window of interest of 0 to 2,500 ms after the maintenance period onset to\nremove filter artefacts at the edges of each trial. To further avoid a bias of\nthe MVL based on differences in spike count, we subsampled spikes such that an\nequal number of spikes was available in each condition. We included neurons\nthat had at least 50 spikes available in each condition (we used a minimum of\nten spikes for the preferred versus non-preferred analysis in category neurons\ndue to a potentially low spike count in the non-preferred condition^77). Next,\nwe extracted the phase in the LFP closest to the timestamp of each spike,\naveraged across all spike-phases in polar space, and computed the MVL for each\nof the 40 frequencies. We repeated this subsampling 500 times and averaged the\nresulting MVLs across all repetitions within conditions. To avoid potential\nbias of load within the preferred versus non-preferred (category neurons; Fig.\n3) or fast versus slow RT SFC comparison (cross-regional analysis; Fig. 5), we\ncomputed the SFC estimates within each load condition and then averaged across\nthe loads.\n\nThe resulting MVL in each neuron-to-channel combination was further normalized\nusing a surrogate distribution, which was computed after adding random noise\nto the timestamps of all spikes within a condition 500 times. Potential biases\nof the MVL based on systematic differences between the conditions (such as\npower differences between conditions within a given frequency band) were\nthereby reduced. Like for the measure of PAC (see above), we fit a normal\ndistribution to the surrogate data and used the mean and the s.d. of that\ndistribution to z-score the raw MVL within each condition.\n\nTo compare SFC between preferred and non-preferred trials, we computed SFC for\nall category neuron-to-channel combinations within the same region in\nfrequencies between 2 and 150 Hz during the maintenance period and compared\ntrials in which preferred or non-preferred stimuli were correctly maintained.\nWe used cluster-based permutation statistics to identify ranges of frequencies\nwith significant differences (Fig. 3f). To determine whether the observed\ngamma SFC difference between preferred and non-preferred trials was dependent\non gamma amplitude, we tested whether gamma SFC (averaged across 70\u2013140 Hz)\nfor category neurons in the hippocampus differed between preferred and non-\npreferred trials for high and low gamma amplitudes separately (median split).\n\nWhether theta or gamma-band SFC was related to the preference of the cell\nand/or load was tested by averaging SFC within the theta (3\u20137 Hz) or gamma\nband (70\u2013140 Hz) and computing a 2 \u00d7 2 permutation-based ANOVA with the\nfactors load and preference for all category neuron to PAC channel\ncombinations in the hippocampus.\n\nTo examine whether cross-regional SFC differed between the two load\nconditions, we computed SFC for all neuron-to-channel combinations between the\nrespective areas in each load condition. We then used cluster-based\npermutation statistics to identify ranges of frequencies with significant\ndifferences (Fig. 5b; alpha level Bonferroni-corrected for all tests across\ntwo MTL areas, three frontal areas and two cell populations). To further\ndetermine a relationship to RT (Fig. 5f), we performed a median split of RTs\nfor all correct trials within each load condition and compared cross-regional\nSFC between hippocampal PAC neurons and the vmPFC, averaged within and the\nsignificant theta range, between fast and slow RTs (averaged across both load\nconditions).\n\n### Selection of PAC neurons\n\nWe selected for neurons whose FR was correlated with both theta phase and\ngamma amplitude during the maintenance period of the task. For all neuron-to-\nchannel combinations within a bundle of microwires, we extracted the data from\ncorrect trials between \u2212500 and 3,000 ms relative to the maintenance period\nonset and estimated the phase of theta signals by filtering between 3 and 7 Hz\nand computing a Hilbert transform in each trial. Gamma amplitude was\ndetermined by computing wavelet convolutions for frequencies between 70 and\n140 Hz in frequency steps of 5 Hz (each wavelet using 7 cycles). Trials were\ncut to 0 to 2,500 ms after maintenance period onset to remove edge artefacts,\nand were then concatenated. The extracted amplitudes in each gamma frequency\nwere z-scored across all trials and averaged across all frequencies. Computing\nwavelet convolutions in 5 Hz steps and z-scoring the data before averaging\navoided biasing power estimates to lower frequencies due to the power law.\nNext, for each neuron\u2013channel pair, we performed a median split of gamma\namplitudes and binned all amplitudes into low and high gamma, respectively. In\neach of the two gamma groups, we further binned the corresponding theta phases\ninto 10 groups (36\u00b0 bins), resulting in a total of 20 bins (Fig. 4a). In each\nof those bins, we then counted the number of spikes that occurred in each\ntheta\u2013gamma bin.\n\nWe fit three Poisson GLMs for each neuron-to-channel combination. In model 1,\nspike count (SC) was a function of theta phase (10 levels), gamma amplitude (2\nlevels), and the interaction between theta phase and gamma amplitude. We\nincluded theta separately as cosine and sine due to the circularity of phase\nvalues^78, which enabled us to treat theta phase as a linear variable. Model 2\nincluded the theta phase and gamma amplitude as main effects but not the\ninteraction term. Model 3 included a main effect for theta phase and an\ninteraction term but no main effect for gamma amplitude:\n\n$$\\text{Model 1:}\\,{\\rm{SC}} \\sim 1+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\cos\n}+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\sin }+{\\rm{Gamma}}+\\left({{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\cos\n}+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\sin }\\right)\\times {\\rm{Gamma}}$$\n\n$$\\text{Model 2:}\\,{\\rm{SC}} \\sim 1+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\cos\n}+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\sin }+{\\rm{Gamma}}$$\n\n$${\\rm{Model\\; 3:}}\\,{\\rm{SC}} \\sim 1+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\cos\n}+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\sin }+\\left({{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\cos }+{{\\rm{Theta}}}_{\\sin\n}\\right)\\times {\\rm{Gamma}}$$\n\nWe next compared pairs of models using a likelihood-ratio test between model 1\nand the two other models (using compare.m). A neuron qualified as a PAC neuron\nif model 1 explained variance in spike counts significantly better than both\nof the other two models (P < 0.01, FDR corrected for all possible channel\ncombinations). The rationale behind each model comparison was as follows.\nFirst, we were specifically interested in neurons that followed the\ninteraction of theta phase and gamma amplitude, that is, PAC, and not just\ntheta phase or gamma amplitude alone. Selecting neurons for which model 1,\nincluding the interaction term, explained spike count variance of a given\nneuron significantly better than model 2, lacking the interaction term,\nensured extracting those neurons. Second, we also compared model 1 to model 3,\nlacking the gamma term, for the following reason. Assume that a given\nneuron\u2013channel combination has an LFP with strong PAC at the field potential\nlevel, that is, strong interactions between theta phase and gamma amplitude,\nand a neuron of which the FR is not related to neither theta phase nor gamma\namplitude. Nevertheless, this situation would result in a significant\ninteraction term in model 1 because the spikes that fall into the low and high\ngamma amplitude groups will have different theta phases (due to PAC). This is\nonly the case if the underlying PAC in the LFP is very strong (an illustration\nand further discussion is provided in Extended Data Fig. 6). However, in this\nscenario, the gamma amplitude term (or the theta phase term) would not be\nsignificant. Comparing model 1 to model 2 and model 3 therefore ensures that\ncells were selected only at PAC neurons in which the interaction term\nexplained variance above and beyond the main effects and interactions alone.\n\nAs we did not observe strong PAC nor persistently active category neurons in\nfrontal regions, we restricted this analysis to channels from the MTL regions\nand performed it separately in each load condition. If spike count variance\nwas significantly better explained by model 1 than the two other models in\neither of the load conditions for at least one neuron-to-channel combination,\nwe included this neuron as a PAC neuron. If a neuron was selected in more than\none neuron-to-channel combination, we selected the combination with the\nhighest R^2 in the full model (model 1). This combined channel was later used\nfor within-region SFC as well as FR correlation analyses. Lastly, to determine\nwhether the number of selected PAC neurons per area was significantly higher\nthan chance, we repeated the entire selection process 200 times after pairing\nspikes and LFPs from different, randomly selected trials, therefore destroying\ntheir relationship with theta phase and gamma amplitude. The P values indicate\nthe proportion of repetitions that resulted in a higher number of selected\nneurons using the shuffled data than the original number of PAC neurons\ndetermined using the unshuffled data.\n\n### Properties of PAC neurons\n\nWe used mixed-effects GLMs with load as a confounder and modelling a random\nintercept for each PAC neuron-to-channel combination nested into patientID\n(using only correct trials and the LFP channel selected for each neuron; see\nabove) to examine the relationship between FR of PAC neurons and single-trial\nestimates of PAC. Note that trial-by-trial correlations are independent from\nthe selection procedure as PAC neurons were selected on the basis of trial-\naveraged theta\u2013gamma interactions, irrespective of their trial-by-trial\nvariance.\n\n### Noise correlations and population category decoding\n\nWe investigated the effect of noise correlations among groups of\nsimultaneously recorded neurons on population decoding accuracies for the\nimage category currently held in mind and on WM behaviour during the\nmaintenance period. To estimate noise correlations among pairs of category and\nPAC neurons, for each neuron, we counted spikes in bins of 200 ms that slid\nacross the maintenance period (0\u20132.5 s after the last picture offset) in steps\nof 25 ms. We then computed the correlation coefficient across all 101 time\nbins in each single trial for each pair of neurons and averaged across all\nconsidered trials within each condition. We used only correct trials for this\nanalysis, and paired only neurons that were recorded in the same session and\nwithin the same brain region. Pairs of neurons recorded on the same channel\nwere not considered as a precaution against spurious correlations caused by\nspike sorting inaccuracies. To assess the significance of noise correlations\namong pairs of neurons, we shuffled trial labels within conditions, that is,\nwithin the preferred and non-preferred category as well as within each load,\n1,000 times in each pair and recomputed the average correlation coefficient\nacross all pairs. The original average correlation coefficient was then\ncompared against the distribution of all average correlation coefficients\nobtained from the 1,000 trial shuffles (Fig. 6a (right)).\n\nTo investigate the contribution of PAC neurons to the population category\ndecoding accuracy when noise correlations among neurons were intact or\nremoved, we used an approach introduced previously^36 (Fig. 6b). To measure\nhow much a single neuron affects the decoding accuracy of an ensemble of\nneurons, this approach finds optimized neuron ensembles that have maximal\ndecoding accuracy by adding each single neuron to the ensemble in a stepwise\nmanner. Each neuron\u2019s contribution to the ensemble can thereby be determined.\nIn more detail, using a linear decoder, first the decoding performance for\neach single neuron in each region is determined from all correct trials. The\nneuron with the best decoding performance is then paired with each remaining\nneuron to determine which pair yields the best decoding accuracy. This most\ninformative pair of neurons is then again combined with each remaining neuron\nto determine the most informative triplet of neurons, and so on. These steps\nwere repeated until all neurons were part of the decoding ensemble.\n\nAs we were most interested in decoding picture category from FRs in the\nmaintenance period, we used trials from load 1 only. This is because the\nmaintenance period in load 3 trials contains intermixed information about the\nthree different categories maintained in WM. We trained a linear support\nvector machine (SVM) decoder (fitcecoc.m; one-versus-one) on 80% of trials and\ntested it on the remaining 20% using z-scored FRs. To ensure an equal amount\nof data for all five categories, we subsampled trials to match the lowest\nnumber of trials available in each stimulus category. Noise correlations among\nneurons were left intact by using the same trials for each neuron or removed\nby shuffling trials per neuron within each category. Shuffling trials within\neach category ensured that the original category label remained correct but\ncorrelations among neurons were removed. Any decoding benefit that is purely\nbased on category-selective firing activity is therefore not affected (Fig. 6b\n(red)). Note that, if PAC neurons enhanced the decodability by \u2018residual\ncoding\u2019 of category information, they should have done so also when noise\ncorrelations were removed through shuffling. We repeated each decoding\nanalysis 500 times and averaged the results to generalize across trial\nselections.\n\nTo test the influence of PAC neurons as well as their noise correlations on\ndecoding performances, we first tested contributions between intact and\nremoved noise correlations for PAC neurons that were added to the ensemble\nbefore maximal decoding performance was reached in each session and area^36.\nThis approach therefore tested the effect that single PAC neurons had on\ninformation encoding within a neural population (Fig. 6c). To determine a\nfunctional specificity of PAC neurons as a group, we further compared the\nmaximal decoding performance before and after all PAC neurons were removed\nfrom the neuronal ensemble in each session. We did this for all sessions that\nhad at least one PAC neuron, and at least two neurons left after removing all\nPAC neurons. We then compared this effect with removing the same number of\nnon-PAC neurons from the ensembles (averaged across 500 iterations of random\nselections).\n\nWe quantified the effect of noise correlations on the geometry of the\npopulation response. The effect that noise correlations have on the encoded\ninformation in a population of neurons depends on the angle between the signal\nand the noise axis^37. To illustrate how the angle between the noise and the\nsignal axes changes with noise correlations, we first simulated neural\nresponses for a population of neurons that were partially tuned to two\ndifferent categories (see Fig. 6f for a simulation of two neurons for which\none was tuned and the other was untuned to category). Firing rates for each\nneuron were drawn from a normal distribution with variable variance. We\nsimulated 200 trials for each category. For tuned neurons, a variable offset\nwas added to the mean of one of the categories. To add noise correlations to\nthe population of neurons, in each trial, we added a random number drawn from\na normal distribution to the FRs of all neurons. To compare our simulation to\na condition with removed noise correlations, we shuffled trials within each\ncategory to destroy noise correlations within conditions but leave signal\ncorrelations among neurons intact. We then determined the signal axis by\ntraining a linear SVM classifier on the FRs from all neurons and extracting\nthe hyperplane (decision boundary) obtained from the model. The signal axis is\ndefined as a vector orthogonal to that plane. The noise axis was determined by\nextracting the first principal component of the data across both categories.\n\nWe then quantified and compare the angle between the signal and the noise axis\nin the recorded data (Fig. 6g). For each recording session, we extracted the\nsignal and the noise axis for the neuronal ensemble at which the difference in\ncategory decoding was maximal between removed and intact noise correlations.\nFor this analysis, we included all sessions that had at least two hippocampal\nneurons available. To obtain the direction of the signal axis, we extracted\nthe hyperplane from each of the ten trained binary SVM classifiers (trained on\n80% of the data; one-versus-one decoding, see above) and derived a vector\northogonal to that plane using a QR decomposition. The noise axis was\ndetermined by extracting the first principal component of the data across\ncategories. The resulting angle between the two vectors was determined and\nthen averaged across all 10 binary learners and all 500 decoding repetitions,\nresulting in one angle per session separately for intact and removed noise\ncorrelations.\n\nTo further determine the functional specificity of PAC neurons, we projected\nthe population responses onto the signal axes and determined the variance of\nthe projection values before and after PAC neurons were removed from the\nensembles at which the difference between intact and removed noise\ncorrelations was maximal (Fig. 6h). This analysis was performed for all\nsessions that had at least one hippocampal PAC neuron, and at least two\nneurons left after removing all PAC neurons from those ensembles. The\nrationale of the analysis was based on the idea that the variance of the\nprojected values should be small when the angle between the noise and signal\naxis is large and vice versa^38. For each binary classifier, we projected the\npopulation responses for each category onto the signal axis and determined\ntheir s.d. We then averaged the obtained variances across both categories, all\n10 binary classifiers and all 500 iterations, and tested the variances between\nintact and removed noise correlations before and after all PAC neurons were\nremoved from the ensembles.\n\nTo compare noise correlations between fast and slow RT trials, we examined all\npossible PAC\u2013category cell pairs in a given session (Fig. 6i). We analysed the\ntrials in which the preferred or non-preferred categories of the category cell\nwere held in WM separately. Fast and slow RT trials were defined by median\nsplit, computed separately in each load condition, and then averaged to avoid\na bias of load in RTs. To assess the specificity of the fast versus slow RT\ntrial difference to PAC neurons, we randomly paired category neurons with any\nother non-PAC neuron and compared noise correlations between fast and slow RT\ntrials (for n = 162 randomly selected pairs; same n as for PAC-to-category\nneuron pairs).\n\nThe significance of population decoding (Extended Data Fig. 7a) was assessed\nby comparing the original decoding accuracy to a distribution of 1,000\ndecoding accuracies after randomly shuffling category labels.\n\n### Statistics\n\nThroughout this Article, we use (cluster-based) nonparametric permutation\ntests (statcond.m as implemented in EEGLab, using option \u2018perm\u2019, or\nft_freqstatistics.m in FieldTrip), that is, tests that do not make assumptions\nabout the underlying distributions, or mixed-effects GLMs (fitglme.m in\nMATLAB) to assess statistical differences between conditions. In these tests,\nrandom permutations of condition labels were performed to estimate an\nunderlying null distribution, which was then used to assess the statistical\nsignificance of the effect. The paired permutation t-tests that we performed\nare equivalent to computing pair-wise condition differences and testing the\ndifferences against zero. All permutations statistics used 10,000\npermutations, and t-tests were tested two-sided unless stated otherwise. The\ncorresponding t and F estimates, which are computed based on a normal\ndistribution, are provided as a reference only. Bayes factors were computed\nusing the BayesFactor package^79. BF_01 indicates the evidence of H0 (null\nhypothesis; no evidence between conditions) over H1. A value of 1 indicates\nequal evidence for H0 and H1, and values larger than 1 indicate more evidence\nfor H0 over H1 and vice versa. SFC estimates tested across several frequencies\nwere corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster-based permutation\nstatistics as implemented in FieldTrip^80 with 10,000 permutations and an\nalpha level of 0.025 for each one-sided cluster, which was also Bonferroni\ncorrected for the number of tests involved. Depending on whether we used\nz-scored FRs or spike counts, we used mixed-effects GLMs based on a normal or\nPoisson distribution, respectively. Finally, error bars shown in figures show\nthe s.e.m. unless otherwise stated.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data used in this study are publicly available in the DANDI Archive^59\n(https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000673).

The lower panel contains the\namplitude envelope for each wavelet as a function of time. (j) Example\noriginal and reconstructed signal after applying the continuous wavelet\ntransform (see Methods). Small deviations from the original signal are due to\nthe fact that signals at frequencies lower or higher than the edge frequencies\nof 2 and 150 Hz, respectively, were not represented by the wavelet transform\nbut present in the original signal. (k) Assessment of the wavelet-based signal\nreconstruction. We computed linear models using the reconstructed signal as\npredictor for the original signal and extracted R-squared values as a function\nof time and frequency in each trial and channel. Values were averaged across\nall trials and all hippocampal channels. An R-squared values of close to 1\nindicates almost perfect reconstruction of the original signal. As stated\nabove, the slight drop in reconstruction quality at extreme frequencies is\nexplained by the fact that signals at frequencies lower or higher than the\nedge frequencies, respectively, were not represented by the wavelet transform\nbut present in the original signal.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Additional PAC analyses.\n\n(a) PAC comodulogram averaged across all channels separately for each area.\nStrongest PAC was observed between theta and gamma in both areas of the MTL.\nFrontal areas did not show strong PAC, with weak PAC at <2 Hz in pre-SMA and\nvmPFC. We focused our analysis on frequencies above 2 Hz (1\u20133 Hz bandpass) to\nensure that at least 2 full cycles fit within our analysis window of 2.5 s\n(length of maintenance period). (b) In addition to testing theta-gamma PAC\nacross significant channels (see main text), we tested PAC between the load\nconditions across patients after averaging all significant PAC channels within\neach patient. The results were similar to the analysis across channels, with\nstrongest PAC in MTL areas and only weak PAC in frontal channels (see percent\nof patients with significant PAC channels below each figure), suggesting that\nthe results were not driven by channels from a single patient. Only in the\nhippocampus again, PAC was stronger for load 1 as compared to load 3 (n = 23\npatients, p = 0.0049), observable in almost each single patient. No\nsignificant differences were found between the load conditions in other\nregions (amygdala: n = 25; pre-SMA: n = 4; dACC: n = 8; vmPFC: n = 13).\nz-scored PAC values were shifted into a positive range by an offset of 1 and\nlog-transformed for illustrative purposes only. All statistics are based on\nnon-transformed z-values. (c) Theta to low gamma (30\u201355 Hz) PAC analyses. We\nalso found strongest theta-low gamma PAC in MTL regions as opposed to frontal\nregions (see percentages below each figure). But for the low gamma band, we\ndid not observe significant differences between the load conditions in any of\nthe regions (hippocampus: n = 148 channels; amygdala: n = 155; pre-SMA: n =\n10; dACC: n = 22; vmPFC: n = 48). See Supplementary Table 2 for additional PAC\nanalysis separated into slow and fast theta. In (b,c), we performed two-sided\npermutation-based t-test and centre values denote mean \u00b1 s.e.m.; ** p < 0.01;\nns = not significant.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 Theta-high gamma PAC control analyses in the\nhippocampus.\n\n(a) Higher memory loads are thought to be accompanied by a wider distribution\nof gamma amplitudes across theta phases, thereby leading to lower PAC\nvalues^82. To quantify the width of the distribution of gamma amplitude as a\nfunction of theta phase in load 3 than load 1, we estimated kappa. Kappa is a\nmeasure that describes the concentration (inverse of variance) of a circular\nvariable around the mean direction. Across all PAC channels, kappa was\nsignificantly lower in load 3 compared to load 1 (n = 137 channels, t(136) =\n\u22123.7453, p = 0.0001) trials. This shows that gamma amplitudes are high for a\nwider range of theta phases for higher memory loads, thereby explaining why\nPAC decreases for higher memory loads. (b) Comparison of theta and gamma\npower. The significant hippocampal PAC channels showed no significant\ndifferences in theta or gamma power between the two load conditions (n = 137).\n(c) To determine the influence of theta waveform shape on PAC, we tested for\ndifferences in theta waveform peak-to-trough as well as rise-to-decay\nasymmetries between the two load conditions (see Methods). We did not find\nsystematic differences between the conditions for both measures (n = 137).\nMoreover, average theta waveforms were overall symmetric as both measures were\nnot significantly different from .5 in any of the conditions. (d) Moreover, if\nthe differences between the load conditions observed for PAC channels in the\nhippocampus were explained by waveform shape differences/theta harmonics, we\nshould also observe an effect for cross-frequency phase-phase coupling between\nthe same frequency bands. We tested for that in all significant hippocampal\nPAC channels and did not observe a significant difference (n = 137). Theta-\nhigh gamma phase-phase coupling was computed as described in^73,83. (e) We\ndetermined the number of significant PAC channels that showed theta-high gamma\nnesting as described by Vaz et al.^69 The left upper and lower panels show two\nexamples of significant PAC channels from the hippocampus that were determined\nto have nesting by the Vaz et al. method (at least three local maxima within a\nwindow of 45 ms around the preferred phase (see Methods)). 110 of the 137\nsignificant PAC channels (80.29%) in the hippocampus showed nesting between\nhigh gamma and theta. When testing PAC between the load conditions after\nremoving channels that did not show significant nesting, PAC was still\nsignificantly lower in load 3 than 1 (n = 110; t(109) = \u22124.10; p = 0.0001).\n(f) Comparison of theta-gamma PAC strength in the hippocampus assessed using\nthe raw modulation index rather than the of z-transformed MI. Raw theta-gamma\nPAC was significantly larger in load 1 compared to load 3 (n = 137; t(136) =\n\u22124.0264, p = 0.0001). (g) Distribution of theta phases at which gamma\namplitude was maximal across all significant PAC channels in the hippocampus\nin load 1 and 3 (upper part). In most channels, gamma amplitude was maximal at\nthe peak or the trough of theta. Note that the local referencing scheme in our\ndata does not allow do make statements about the polarity of theta. Red bars\nindicate the mean vector length across all phases. The difference in theta\nphase at which gamma amplitude was maximal between the two load conditions was\nnot significantly different from zero (bottom part). (h) We further assessed\nwhether PAC peak frequencies differed between the load conditions either\nwithin the theta or the gamma band. To do so, we recomputed PAC using a finer\nresolution for phase frequencies (i.e., a step size of 0.5 instead of 2 Hz)\nand determined the frequency bin for which PAC was maximal for the theta and\nthe gamma band separately for all channels and both loads. We did not find\nsignificant systematic shifts in PAC peak frequencies between the load\nconditions in theta or gamma frequencies (n = 137). In (a-f,h), we performed\ntwo-sided permutation based-t-tests and centre values denote mean \u00b1 s.e.m. ***\np < 0.001, ns = not significant.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Category neuron selection and persistent activity.\n\n(a) In hippocampus, amygdala, and vmPFC (all p = 0.002, right-sided\npermutation test) the selected number of category neurons was larger than\nexpected by chance (p < 0.01; Bonferroni corrected; see Methods). The null\ndistribution (grey) was estimated by repeating the selection procedure after\nshuffling the category labels for 500 times. Numbers of selected neurons in\ndACC and pre-SMA were not significantly different from those expected by\nchance. (b). Category neurons in both areas of the MTL, hippocampus (n = 89;\npref. vs. baseline: p = 0.0001; non-pref.: p = 0.0001) and amygdala (n = 181;\npref.: p = 0.0001; non-pref.: p = 0.0001), showed persistent activity during\nthe delay period of the task, during which no picture was presented on the\nscreen. Note that category neurons were selected during the encoding period\nonly, making the delay period independent from the selection criteria. FR\nremained significantly higher when their preferred as compared to non-\npreferred categories were maintained in memory (hippocampus: p = 0.025;\namygdala: p = 0.037). The activity of category neurons in the vmPFC (right)\nduring the delay period was not significantly larger than that during baseline\n(n = 37; pref.: p = 0.12; non-pref.: p = 0.26). Also, their FRs did not differ\nsignificantly between when the preferred and the non-preferred category of a\ncell was maintained in WM (t(36) = 1.03, p = 0.32, BF_01 = 3.47). The FR of\nvmPFC neurons thus went back to baseline levels when no stimulus was presented\non the screen. FR for selected neurons in the pre-SMA (n = 18) and dACC (n =\n14) are shown only for completeness despite the proportion of these cells not\nexceeding those expected by chance. All comparisons are based on two-sided\npermutation-based t-tests. Centre values denote mean \u00b1 s.e.m. *** p < 0.001,\n** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05, ns = not significant.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Additional analyses for category cells in the MTL.\n\n(a) Unlike for preferred trials, we did not observe a load effect for MTL\ncategory cells when non-preferred categories were maintained during the\nmaintenance period (n = 270). (b) In addition to our statistics across single\nneurons, we performed nested random-intercept GLMs for patient-level\nstatistics^84. In the hippocampus, FR of category cells was significantly\nhigher for preferred as compared to non-preferred as well as for correct vs.\nincorrect trials. There was no main effect of load as expected, which only\nemerged when we tested for load differences in preferred trials only (data not\nshown). In the amygdala, we observed a significant effect for preference,\nwhere FR was higher in preferred than non-preferred trials. Again, the load\neffect was only significant when tested in preferred trials only (data not\nshown). There was no effect for accuracy. (c) When averaging theta band (3\u20137\nHz) SFC values for hippocampal category neurons paired with significant PAC\nchannels, we did not observe a significant main effect for load or preference\nnor a significant interaction (n = 151; permutation-based F-test). (d) We\nperformed a median split of gamma amplitudes across trials and tested gamma\nSFC between category cells and significant PAC channels in the hippocampus\nseparately for spikes that occurred during high and low gamma amplitudes\n(spike counts were adjusted across conditions). We observed a significant\ndifference in gamma SFC between preferred and non-preferred trials only for\nspikes that occurred during high (n = 151, p = 0.0015), not during low gamma\namplitudes (n = 151, p = 0.84). (e) When paired with non-PAC channels, we did\nnot observe differences in the gamma band between preferred and non-preferred\ntrials for normalized SFC values for category cells in hippocampus or\namygdala. In the hippocampus, we observed a significant difference in the\nalpha range (7\u201311 Hz) with SFC for non-preferred trials higher than for\npreferred trials, which we did not further consider in our analyses. (f)\nComparing SFC for category neurons across all channels (not separated into\nPAC/Non-PAC channels) revealed significantly higher gamma-band SFC for\npreferred than non-preferred trials in the hippocampus (cluster-p = 0.007,\ntwo-sided cluster-based permutation t-test with Bonferroni-corrected alpha-\nlevel for two MTL areas), similar to what we observed for PAC channels only.\nThere were no significant differences in the amygdala. (g) To test whether the\ngamma SFC effect for category cells in the hippocampus persisted at the\npatient level, we averaged gamma SFC across all category neuron to channel\npairs within each patient and then compared the per-patient average between\npreferred and non-preferred trials. Patient-averaged gamma SFC was\nsignificantly higher for preferred trials, suggesting that the effect was not\ndriven by a few channels or patients (n = 19, t(18) = 2.8512, p = 0.005). In\n(a,c,d,g), we performed two-sided permutation-based t-tests. Centre values\ndemote mean \u00b1 s.e.m (coloured areas in e,f). *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p <\n0.05; ns = not significant.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 Simulations supporting the PAC neuron selection\napproach.\n\nWe argue that a neuron that fires randomly with respect to theta phase and\ngamma power could still be selected as a PAC neuron if only the GLM\ninteraction term between theta phase and gamma amplitude is considered. In\naddition to selecting neurons whose FRs are better explained by a model\nincluding an interaction term as compared to a model with no interaction term,\nwe therefore introduced a second criterion by comparing the full model against\na model that lacks the gamma amplitude term. The simulations presented here\nare meant to visualize our reasoning. In (a), we simulate theta (6 Hz) and\ngamma (80 Hz) signals, where gamma amplitudes perfectly couple to theta phase.\nThis highly artificial LFP signal only serves to simplify visualization. We\nalso include illustrations in (b) to (d) using an originally recorded LFP\nchannel from our dataset (filtered between 3\u20137 Hz and 70\u2013140 Hz) that shows\nstrong levels of PAC. This is to show that the same arguments also hold for\nreal data. For the purpose of these illustrations, we used an LFP signal of\nroughly 160 s length and simulated 300 spike timestamps (black ticks), of\nwhich 9 s are plotted. (a) In this simulation, we modelled random spike\ntimestamps with respect to theta phase and gamma amplitude (upper panel).\nAccording to our GLM selection approach, we grouped spikes in 10 theta phase\nbins and 2 gamma amplitude bins and determined spike counts in each bin (lower\npanels). As can be seen from the histograms in the lower panels, the theta\nphase distribution of spike counts differs between low and high gamma\namplitudes, resulting in a highly significant interaction term between theta\nphase and gamma amplitude. The reason for this is that gamma amplitude itself\nis already perfectly coupled to theta phase. Separating spikes into low and\nhigh gamma will therefore also result in different theta distributions among\nthe two spike count groups. Thus, when testing a model that contains theta\nphase and gamma amplitudes as well as their interaction against a model\nwithout the interaction, spike counts will be highly significantly better\nexplained by the full model, as was the case in this example (p < 0.001; see\nlikelihood-ratio test results on the right). However, since the time stamps\nare random, we should not observe a difference in overall spike counts between\nlow and high gamma amplitudes, which was also the case in this example (p =\n0.98). Introducing such a gamma term comparison as a second selection\ncriterion thus ensures that this simulated random neuron would not have been\nselected. In 1000 repetitions of this simulation, our approach would have\nselected only 1.8% of such randomly spiking neurons (see text on right side).\n(b) Similar to (a) but using a real LFP recording from our dataset that shows\nstrong levels of PAC. 300 spike timestamps were again modelled randomly with\nrespect to theta phase and gamma amplitude. Similar albeit weaker statistics\nwere observed in these simulations. (c) Using the same LFP as in (b) but now\nsimulating 300 spike timestamps that prefer high gamma amplitudes and a theta\nphase of 0 (i.e., PAC spiking plus 10% noise). Here, as desired, the full\nmodel explains spike counts significantly better than both the other models\nand this neuron would be selected as a PAC neuron. (d) In this example, we\nsimulate a \u201cgamma neuron\u201d, i.e., a neuron whose FR follows gamma amplitude,\nbut not theta phase. In most cases (79.3% of 1000 repetitions), these gamma\nneurons were successfully rejected. Since we did not control for theta phase\nin these simulations using a strong LFP channel, however, around 20% of the\nsimulations modelled PAC rather than pure gamma spiking.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 7 SFC and theta phase shift analysis for PAC neurons.\n\n(a) PAC neurons were not selective for category in hippocampus (left) and\namygdala (right). Even during encoding, category could not be efficiently\ndecoded from FR of \u201cPAC only\u201d neurons (all other p = 0.001, right-sided\npermutation test). Decoding performance is shown as mean \u00b1 s.d. across 1,000\ndecoding repetitions. Black horizontal lines indicate mean decoding of 1,000\nrandomly shuffled category labels (chance level). Decoding was performed for\npseudo-populations of category or PAC neurons, respectively. (b,c) Theta and\ngamma SFC between PAC neurons and local LFP recordings did not differ as a\nfunction of load in (b) the hippocampus (theta: t(78) = \u22121.54, p = 0.13;\ngamma: t(78) = \u22121.12, p = 0.27, n = 79), or (c) the amygdala (theta: t(162) =\n\u22120.71, p = 0.47; gamma: t(162) = 0.76, p = 0.45, n = 163). Theta and gamma\nSFC, however, were both significantly stronger than shuffled surrogates in\nboth areas (all p = 0.0001). Each dot is a neuron-channel combination. In\n(a,b), we performed two-sided permutation-based t-tests and centre values\ndenote mean \u00b1 s.e.m. (d) The preferred theta phase of PAC neurons did not\ndiffer significantly as a function of load in both areas of the MTL. Red bars\nshow the mean difference in preferred theta phases between load 1 and 3 across\nall PAC neurons. *** p < 0.001; ns = not significant.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 8 Cross-regional SFC for pre-SMA, dACC, and vmPFC, as\nwell as for fast- and broad-spiking PAC neurons from the hippocampus.\n\nRelated to Fig. 5. (a) Cross-regional SFC between hippocampal PAC neurons and\nLFPs recorded in pre-SMA (left) or dACC (right) did not reveal any difference\nbetween the two WM load conditions in any of the frequencies. (b) To test\nwhether the load modulation of theta-band cross-regional SFC between\nhippocampal PAC neurons and vmPFC LFPs persisted on the patient level, we\naveraged theta SFC across all PAC neuron to channel pairs within each patient\nand then compared the within-patient averages between the two load conditions.\nAt the patient-level, theta cross-regional SFC was significantly higher for\nload 3 than load 1 trials, suggesting that the effect was not driven by a few\nchannels or patients (n = 20; t(19) = \u22122.8297, p = 0.0071). (c) Comparison of\ncross-regional hippocampal-vmPFC SFC between PAC and category neurons revealed\nthe load modulation of cross-regional theta SFC between hippocampal neurons\nand vmPFC LFPs was significantly stronger for PAC than for category neurons\n(PAC: n = 175, Cat: n = 215; t(376.07) = 3.3942, p = 0.0001; unpaired two-\nsided permutation t-test). Each dot is a neuron-channel combination. (d)\nEarlier work has suggested that cognitive control might especially be governed\nthrough long-range connections between frontal and sensory regions that target\ninhibitory interneurons to (dis-)inhibit local circuitries^41,53,85. We thus\nasked if we observe a differential effect for the hippocampal PAC neuron\nconnections after separating them into narrow- and broad-spiking neurons based\noff their waveform shapes, which has been suggested to categorize neurons into\ninhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively^86,87. For analysis of\nconnections involving narrow- and broad-spiking PAC neurons separately, we\nobserved a significant difference in theta SFC between load 3 and load 1 only\nfor the narrow-spiking PAC neurons (trough-to-peak time <0.5 ms; n = 91\nconnections; cluster-p = 0.0001, left). No effect was found for broad-spiking\nPAC neurons (n = 84) (e) Similarly, theta SFC for fast RT was significantly\nstronger than for slow RT only for narrow-spiking (t(90) = 3.02, p = 0.003, n\n= 91, left), not for broad-spiking PAC neuron connections between hippocampus\nand vmPFC (t(75) = \u22120.66, p = 0.52, n = 76, right; spikes were median split\ninto fast and slow RT trials per load condition and then averaged across loads\nto avoid potential confounds). (f,g) We did not find significant differences\nbetween the load conditions for (f) within-region SFC or (g) cross-regional\nSFC to hippocampal LFPs across all neurons from the vmPFC. (h) We further\ntested whether there were any non-specific global state changes between\ncorrect and incorrect trials in any of the three frontal regions. FRs for all\nneurons recorded in the three frontal areas were not significantly different\nbetween correct and incorrect trials during the delay period (pre-SMA: n =\n201; dACC: n = 180; vmPFC: n = 201). In (a,d,f,g) we performed two-sided\ncluster-based permutation t-tests, centre values denote mean, coloured areas\ns.e.m. In (b,c,e,h), we performed two-sided permutation t-tests and centre\nvalues denote mean \u00b1 s.e.m. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; ns = not significant.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 9 Further analysis of noise correlations among PAC and\ncategory neurons.\n\nRelated to Fig. 6. (a) Distribution of trial-averaged, bin-wise correlation\ncoefficients for all possible pairs of category and PAC neurons in the\nhippocampus (n = 162) and amygdala (n = 892). In both regions, correlation\ncoefficients were significantly higher than zero on average (both p = 0.0001).\n(b) Example showing trial-by-trial noise correlations for a pair of\nsimultaneously recorded category and PAC neurons from the hippocampus. Each\ndot represents the spike count in a correct trial during the maintenance\nperiod for each neuron. For this example, the firing rate of the two neurons\nwas positively correlated across trials. (c) Correlation coefficients for all\npossible pairs of category and PAC neurons in the hippocampus (n = 162) and\namygdala (n = 892) for trial-by-trial noise correlations, computed within\nconditions and then averaged. In both regions, correlation coefficients\ncovered a broad range of both positive and negative values and were\nsignificantly higher than zero on average (both p = 0.0001). (d) Repeat of the\ntrial-wise correlation analysis for all possible PAC-category neuron pairs in\nthe hippocampus. Shuffling trial labels within conditions for 1000 times\nresulted in far lower correlations between pairs of neurons than unshuffled\ntrial labels (cyan line; mean of correlation coefficients across all pairs),\nshowing that trial shuffling successfully removed noise correlations (p =\n0.0001, right-sided permutation test). (e) Bin-wise correlations among pairs\nof category neurons and PAC neurons that were not also category neurons were\nsignificantly positive on average in hippocampus (n = 101, p = 0.0003) and\namygdala (n = 555, p = 0.0001). (f) Correlations between pairs of category\nneuron and PAC neurons that were not also category neurons in the hippocampus\n(cyan line). Within-condition trial shuffling (grey) significantly reduced\nnoise correlations (p = 0.0001, right-sided permutation test). (g) Maximal\ndecoding performance for intact and removed noise correlations before and\nafter removing only PAC neurons that were not also category neurons from the\nensembles (\u201cnonCatPAC\u201d neurons). Like for all PAC neurons, decoding\nperformance was enhanced by nonCatPAC neurons only when noise correlations\nwere intact (n = 23 sessions, p = 0.0005). (h) Bin-wise correlations (averaged\nacross trials) among pairs of hippocampal PAC and category neurons did not\ndiffer between fast and slow RT trials for non-preferred trials (n = 162, p =\n0.90). Each dot represents the correlations coefficient for a pair after\naveraging, computed per trial and then averaged across all considered trials.\n(i) Correlations for pairs of PAC and category neurons in preferred trials\nwere averaged within each patient and then compared between fast and slow RTs\nacross all patients (n = 16, p = 0.0027). Each dot is a patient. (j) In the\namygdala, adding single PAC neurons (n = 28) to the decoding ensemble did not\nonly enhance decodability when noise correlations were intact (p = 0.0001),\nbut also when removed (p = 0.049; intact \u2013 removed: p = 0.0009). (k)\nSimilarly, removing all PAC neurons from the ensembles in the amygdala \u2013 like\nremoving randomly selected cells \u2013 led to a significant decrease in decoding\nfor both, intact (p = 0.0001) and removed (p = 0.0001) noise correlations (n =\n32 sessions). (l) Comparing correlations among PAC and category neurons\nbetween fast and slow RT trials in preferred trials did not reveal a\nsignificant difference in the amygdala (n = 884 pairs). In (a,c,e,g-l), we\nperformed two-sided permutation-based t-tests and centre values denote mean \u00b1\ns.e.m. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05; ns = not significant.\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Tables 1\u20135, Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary\nReferences.\n\n### Reporting Summary\n\n### Peer Review File\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
