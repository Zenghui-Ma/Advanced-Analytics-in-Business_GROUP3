They worry about what is being lost. They\ncan sound like this bookseller in Buffalo, New York:\n\n> Books are not product. Books are creative endeavors as individual and\n> singular as any work of art. They cannot be tweaked as if they are idling\n> wrong. They can't have leaves pulled off as they rot like a cabbage or\n> lettuce.\n\nI call the people who say such things the Gutenbourgeois. They believe in the\ncultural primacy of writers and editors and they feel good\u2014even a bit\nsuperior\u2014about working in publishing. They believe it is their job to drive\nculture forward. The web, they are a little proud to admit, confuses them.\nThey say: \u201cWe gave away all those short stories on our website but it sold no\nbooks.\u201d Or: \u201cWe built a promo site for our famous author who does the crime\nnovels and it was just a total boondoggle with no traffic.\u201d Or: \u201cThe magazine\ncan't get enough pageviews, even after we hired the famous blogger. Now\nmanagement wants to make people pay for access.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d I say, \u201cmaybe you're doing it wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d they say, \u201cwe tweet.\u201d\n\nThat's when I tell them about the fundamental question of the web.\n\n### The Fundamental Question of the Web\n\nOne can spend a lot of time defining a medium in terms of how it looks, what\nit transmits, wavelengths used, typographic choices made, bandwidth available.\nI like to think about media in terms of questions answered.\n\nHere's one question: \u201cI'm bored, and I want to get out of the house and have\nan experience, possibly involving elves or bombs. Where do I go?\u201d\n\nThe answer: You could go to a movie.\n\nHere's another: \u201cHow do I distract myself without leaving the house?\u201d\n\nYou might turn on the TV.\n\n\u201cI'm driving, or making dinner. How do I make a mundane thing like that more\ninteresting?\u201d\n\nRadio! Especially NPR or talk radio.\n\n\u201cWhat's going on locally and in the world, at length?\u201d\n\nTry this newspaper!\n\nA medium has a niche. A sitcom works better on TV than in a newspaper, but a\n10,000 word investigative piece about a civic issue works better in a\nnewspaper.\n\nWhen it arrived the web seemed to fill all of those niches at once. The web\nwas surprisingly good at emulating a TV, a newspaper, a book, or a radio.\nWhich meant that people expected it to answer the questions of each medium,\nand with the promise of advertising revenue as incentive, web developers set\nout to provide those answers. As a result, people in the newspaper industry\nsaw the web as a newspaper. People in TV saw the web as TV, and people in book\npublishing saw it as a weird kind of potential book. But the web is not just\nsome kind of magic all-absorbing meta-medium. It's its own thing. And like\nother media it has a question that it answers better than any other. That\nquestion is:\n\nWhy wasn't I consulted?\n\n### Why Wasn't I Consulted?\n\n\u201cWhy wasn't I consulted,\u201d which I abbreviate as WWIC, is the fundamental\nquestion of the web. It is the rule from which other rules are derived. Humans\nhave a fundamental need to be consulted, engaged, to exercise their knowledge\n(and thus power), and no other medium that came before has been able to tap\ninto that as effectively.\n\nI first wrote about this in 2007, after 18 months of isolating and frustrating\nwork on a website:\n\n> Brace yourself for the initial angry wave of criticism: How dare you, I hate\n> it, it's ugly, you're stupid. The Internet runs on knee-jerk reactions.\n> People will test your work against their pet theories: It is not free, and\n> thus has no value; it lacks community features; I can't believe you don't\n> use dotcaps, lampsheets, or pixel scrims; it is not written in Rusp or\n> Erskell; my cat is displeased. The ultimate question lurks beneath these\n> curses: why wasn't I consulted?\n\nThat line was tossed off, but since I wrote it I've seen the same pattern\neverywhere. I've explained it to many other web people, and they laugh, but\nthen a few months later some say, \u201cyou know...\u201d\n\nWWIC is the thing people talk about when they talk about nicer-sounding things\nlike \u201cthe wisdom of crowds\u201d or \u201ccognitive surplus.\u201d It has become the first\nthing I think about when I think about the web. I've spent a lot of time with\nusers, and as part of various web communities. I've answered thousands of\nemails about things I built or said. Now, when I sit down to graffle, I start\nby asking: \u201cHow do we deal with the WWIC problem?\u201d Everything else comes\nafter.\n\nA surprising portion of the writing about the web is actually about WWIC,\nabout the question of who controls what territory. Here are a few random\nexamples of how this plays out, from my WWIC folder: Michael Arrington's\n\u201cDigg's Biggest Problem Is Its Users And Their Constant Opinions On Things.\u201d\nOr the way that digital groupies claim ownership of their heroes online. Or\nhow Javier Grillo-Marxuach, a producer on Lost, took a year off from Star Wars\nafter realizing how his anger with George Lucas was overwhelming his life:\n\n> In our gluttonous lust to replicate the exhilaration of a matinee from 1977,\n> we demanded that his otherwise fun little film metastasize into so pervasive\n> a chunk of the collective unconscious that Carl Jung now sports Mandalorian\n> armor and flies a modified Firespray-31 attack cruiser turned slave ship.\n\nThey \u201cdemanded\u201d; as fans, they felt that was their right. (Lost, of course,\nwas masterful about consulting its fans\u2014as much wiki as show by the end.)\n\nThere's also Steve Martin, whose Q&A session at the 92nd St. Y in New York\nCity was interrupted by a bored audience that demanded better. Wrote Martin:\n\n> What I wasn't told was that the viewers were going to be encouraged to send\n> in e-mails during the discussion; what I didn't expect was that the Y would\n> take the temperature of those e-mailed reactions, and then respond to them\n> by sending a staff member onstage, mid-conversation, with a note that said,\n> 'Discuss Steve's career.'\n\nFinally, there's the Register-Citizen newspaper of Torrington, Connecticut. In\na sincere attempt to reimagine themselves in the age of the Internet they\nrecently opened up newsroom story meetings to all comers. The process of\nputting together the paper\u2014once the territorial imperative of editors\u2014is now\nopen to anyone wanting to swing by and mumble.\n\nWhat sums it up best, to me, is this image published on the blog Kotaku. The\nimage was posted as a comment on a blog post linking to an article about\nBritish computer-industry millionaire Clive Sinclair marrying a younger woman.\nHere is the image:\n\nConsider what that cartoon means in that context: It implies that the\ncommenter feels\u2014with some irony and self-awareness, I'm sure\u2014that his opinion,\nin some way, is relevant to the question of whether Clive Sinclair should\nmarry a particular woman. This is, for many obvious reasons, completely\ninsane. And yet there was an image already sketched and available to that\ncommenter so that he could express this exact sentiment of choosing not to be\noutraged at a situation he read about on the Internet. WWIC in action.\n\n(Update: Thanks to Riaz Moola, Karl Dubost, Daniel Nugent, Josh Braun, Jason\nAlderman, Calvin Bienvenu, and Hex I learned that this image is by KC Green\n[who is disappointed that it has become a meme]. It's the final two panels of\na \u201cCustom Comic\u201d\u2014comics created by audience request\u2014entitled \u201cAndys 16 Now -\nBobby\u201d. See also.)\n\n### The Unconsulted\n\nIf you tap into the human need to be consulted you can get some interesting\nreactions. Here are a few: Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, Hunch, Reddit,\nMetaFilter, YouTube, Twitter, StumbleUpon, About, Quora, Ebay, Yelp, Flickr,\nIMDB, Amazon.com, Craigslist, GitHub, SourceForge, every messageboard or site\nwith comments, 4Chan, Encyclopedia Dramatica. Plus the entire Open Source\nmovement. If you spend more time on sites like those listed here than you do\nreading books, watching TV, or visiting sites like ESPN.com or NYTimes.com,\nthen, like me, the web is now your native medium.\n\nThe obvious example of WWIC at work is Wikipedia, created for free by unpaid\nlabor. It tapped into the basic human need to be consulted and never looked\nback.\n\nThen there's YouTube. It was created so that anyone could upload and\ndistribute videos. So that's one level of WWIC\u2014to hell with TV, people should\nlook at me! The site has comments, so people can discuss the videos\u2014a second\nlevel of WWIC. But there are now also thumbs-up/thumbs-down icons so that you\ncan rank the comments and the video, a third level of WWIC.\n\nOnce you see that third level, a website is complete. You're down to the\nbedrock. A boolean or integer value is the digital equivalent of a grunt. You\ncan't get any more basic than a like, or a thumbs-up, or a favorite.\n\nMy favorite among the sites with favorites is MetaFilter, which asks its\nmembers to filter out, and write up, the best of the web, and then invites\nthem to discuss what was filtered. The creators of MetaFilter never worried\nabout having the most advanced web technology in place, or about looking like\nother sites. The focus, above profit, was on moderating and managing the\ncommunity. That worked very well. But while huge, the site remains a great\nread. I visit it far more often than I visit the website of my local paper.\n\nMany years after founding MetaFilter, its creators took what they learned and\nmade a Q&A spinoff site, Ask MetaFilter, that did away with the need to filter\nthe web and went straight to the users for both questions and answers. It has\nbeen, both in terms of traffic and editorial quality, a success. I suggest\nthat the engine that drives its success is that need to be consulted, to\ndemonstrate knowledge and superiority. It turns that instinct to good, and\nrewards those who exercise it judiciously\u2014certainly the few times I have\nanswered Ask Metafilter questions I've felt like a champion, and it's double\ngratifying if your answer is picked as one of the best. The site allows one-\nclick favorites, so that we (including I) might grunt our praise. Of course\nthere's also MetaTalk, the gray, the part of MetaFilter that lets people talk\nabout MetaFilter, so that people can feel consulted about being consulted.\nIt's WWIC all the way down\u2014but acknowledged, understood, and turned, through\npainstaking labor, to good.\n\nThe rapidly expanding Internet community Reddit has its own approach to the\nWWIC problem\u2014a simpler form for posts, less room for narrative and voting on\nstories and comments, which allows us to punish or reward, and derives from\nthe aggregate punishments and rewards a view of the most popular or approved-\nof stories and comments. It even has something akin to Ask MetaFilter with its\n\u201cIamA (Ask Me Anything)\u201d section. (Question #2 at this writing\u2014\u201cI am a New\nYork Times bestselling novelist. Ask me anything.\u201d) But it's built to scale\u2014to\ncapture more and more links with more and more \u201csubreddits.\u201d Same principle,\ndifferent approach.\n\nThe list grows; the Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange community has blown up to\nunbelievable size, and I'm now getting way too many emails announcing people\njoining Quora, another pure-WWIC play; also, it'd be hard to get more WWIC\nthan Hunch, which consults people on all manner of subjects to create a\ngeneralized prediction engine. These sites sometimes explain themselves by\nsaying that they tap into human generosity or use the power of community, and\nthat's true in its way, but it's a generosity that must be watched, moderated,\nand rewarded with various kinds of points and credits. Altruism, yes, but at\nwhat cost?\n\nSuch contentions aside, there is no other medium that could do what Stack\nOverflow does. You couldn't do it on TV, or in a newspaper, or in books. You\nneed a back button, a database, and a community. You could try, of\ncourse\u2014anyone can download all the questions and answers under the terms of\nthe site's Creative Commons license\u2014but that would be a corpus without the\nspark of life.\n\nSo what kind of medium is the web if the boundaries are so unclear, and if the\nfundamental question is WWIC? This is from an interview with MetaFilter\nfounder Matt Haughey:\n\n> What makes MetaFilter a success?\n>\n> Matt: I'd like to think it's intense moderation and customer service.\n\nThat is the point that I am trying to make. The web is not, despite the\ndesires of so many, a publishing medium. The web is a customer service medium.\n\u201cIntense moderation\u201d in a customer service medium is what \u201cediting\u201d was for\npublishing.\n\n### Working Within a Customer Service Medium\n\nThat's what I tell my Gutenbourgeois friends, if they'll listen. I say: Create\na service experience around what you publish and sell. Whatever \u201ccustomer\nservice\u201d means when it comes to books and authors, figure it out and do it. Do\nit in partnership with your readers. Turn your readers into members. Not\nvisitors, not subscribers; you want members. And then don't just consult them,\nbut give them tools to consult amongst themselves. These things are cheap and\neasy now if you hire one or two smart people instead of a large consultancy.\nDefine what the boundaries are in your community and punish transgressors\nwithout fear of losing a sale. Then, if your product is good, you'll sell\nthings. (Don't count on your fellow Gutenbourgeois to buy things. They're\nclicking the little thumb icon on YouTube like everyone else.) If you don't\nwant to do that then just find niche communities who might conceivably care\nabout your products and buy great ad placements. It's a better online spend.\n\nI'm winging it here, but I mean it. I own[ed] SavePublishing.com (that I\nhaven't been able to figure out what to do with it is, I think, emblematic). I\nalso own WhyWasntIConsulted.com, and welcome suggestions on what to do with\nit. Obviously. (Oh, and [I once owned] CommentsAreClosed.com.)\n\nThe days of the web as all-purpose media emulator are numbered. Apps on mobile\nare gaining traction; the web browser, despite great and ongoing effort, will\nnot become the universal platform for everything ever. Apps provide niche\nexperiences. People apparently like niche experiences enough to pay for them.\nThis is serious.\n\nSadly, mobile apps, as a class of software, are less free than many would\nlike, in terms of both freedom to tinker and freedom from payment. This upsets\npeople who are commited to the WWIC web, but for other people, like publishers\nwho have been told that they \u201cdon't get it\u201d for a decade, the idea of a\ndefensible territory, a walled garden, looks just swell. That the new thing\nmight make, instead of lose, money is a morale booster. So media properties\nare migrating into these apps, where boundaries between reader and publisher\ncan be defined and enforced. TV is migrating back to TV, but \u201csmarter.\u201d To\nread a book people will turn to their phones. But the web is where they will\ngo to complain.\n\n### Further Discussion\n\nWhyWasntIConsulted.net [was] up and running, cataloging examples of people on\nthe web who haven't been consulted. Writes the site's creator: \u201cThis is a\ngroup for discussing interesting developments in social media. Anyone with\nsomething to say is welcome to jump in and share links or contribute to the\ndiscussion. I think you need to have a Posterous account to leave replies.\nSorry.\u201d I'll be contributing, and you should too!\n\nTwitter, of course.\n\nOn the gray, member Miko pointed out some sloppy thinking on my part. In the\ninterest of accuracy and brevity I cut the paragraph in question. Member Rory\nMarinich said, wisely:\n\n> Don't blame people for looking bad in systems that aren't well-designed to\n> make them look good. Self-importance doesn't come from people wanting to\n> talk. It comes from systems that aren't good at fitting people comfortably\n> in. (And this doesn't just apply to points-ranking. It also applies to\n> communities that haven't figured out ways to explain to people why their\n> pedantic asshattery is not welcome.)\n\nRelated Links [X]\n\nThis is The Web Is a Customer Service Medium by Paul Ford, published Thursday,\nJanuary 6, 2011.
