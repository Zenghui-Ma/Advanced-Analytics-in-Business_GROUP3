This move was also\ntimed to coincide with a number of key arrests related to this operation. In\nthis entry, we will briefly explain what LabHost was, how it affected its\nvictims, and the impact of this law enforcement operation \u2014 including the\nassistance provided by Trend Micro.\n\n## What is LabHost?\n\nFigure 1. LabHost sign-in page\n\ndownload\n\nIn late 2021, LabHost (AKA LabRat) emerged as a new PhaaS platform, growing\nover time to eventually offer dozens of phishing pages targeting banks, high-\nprofile organizations, and other service providers located around the world,\nbut most notably in Canada, the US, and the UK. The popularity of the platform\nmeant that at the time of the takedown, it boasted more than 2,000 criminal\nusers, who had used it to deploy over 40,000 fraudulent sites leading to\nhundreds of thousands of victims worldwide.\n\nThe platform offered a number of key benefits to its criminal clientele,\nincluding:\n\n  * The ability to obtain two-factor authentication (2FA) codes by proxying the connection to the phished organization using Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) techniques. This is implemented in a tool called LabRat.\n  * Phishing pages for several key Canadian, US, and international banks\n  * Phishing pages for additional services such as Spotify, postal services such as DHL and An Post (the Irish post office), car toll services, insurance providers, and more.\n  * Highly customizable phishing templates that can request standard name and address information, email, dates of birth, standard security question answers, card numbers, passwords, and PINs.\n  * The ability to request the creation of bespoke phishing pages for target brands.\n  * Ease of management, since the platform takes care of most of the tedious tasks in developing and managing phishing page infrastructure; all the malicious actor needs is a virtual private server (VPS) to host the files and from which the platform can automatically deploy.\n  * Detailed campaign success statistics for criminal users.\n  * Management of any successfully stolen credentials.\n  * A popular SMS smishing component, LabSend, that supports customized SMS templates; this greatly eases the distribution of the phishing pages to target victims.\n\nIn essence, a PhaaS outsources the traditional task of having to develop and\nhost phishing pages for a target organization, plus having to develop methods\nto extract stolen details, substantially dropping the barrier for entry to\nphishing\n\nNote that LabHost was not the only such PhaaS provider \u2014 there were many\nothers, such as Frappo and Greatness. Furthermore, there were several red-team\ntools developed for similar purposes, such as Evilgophish, EvilPhish, and\nEvilGinx2. However, LabHost was certainly one of the most popular and damaging\nin the market.\n\nLabHost offered three membership tiers paid via bitcoin:\n\nStandard (US$179 per month). This offered dozens of pages targeting Canadian\ninstitutions and hosted of a maximum of three active phishing pages at the\nsame time.\n\nPremium (US$249 per month). In addition to all the features of the Standard\ntier, Premium offered dozens of pages targeting US institutions and increased\nthe size of its active phishing pages to 20.\n\nWorld Membership (US$300 per month). The highest tier offered over 70 phishing\npages targeting international organizations and added 10 hosted phishing pages\n(separate to Premium or Standard licenses). These include organizations in\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, France,\nGermany, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg,\nMalaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South\nKorea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UAE, and Venezuela.\n\ndownload\n\nFigure 2. The LabHost \u201ctiers\u201d\n\ndownload\n\nQuarterly and annual subscriptions were also available. In addition, the\nplatform administrators offered technical support services via a dedicated\nTelegram channel for all service levels.\n\n## Example attack flow\n\nFigure 3. LabHost attack flow showing fake SMS and An Post website\n\ndownload\n\nFigure 3 shows an example of a fairly typical attack flow for an SMS-based\nphishing attack from LabHost, based on the target\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe user\u2019s target phone receives an SMS related to a service offered in their\ncountry \u2014 in this case, it mimicked a customs charge on a posted item to\nIreland. Since Ireland is an island nation, it\u2019s not unusual for Irish people\nwho are expecting a parcel from outside of the EU (such as the UK or the US)\nto receive these kinds of legitimate requests. Other common targeting\ntechniques used against Irish users include local bank or local road toll\nservices, or their equivalents from other countries.\n\n  1. In this case, the smish would have been sent via the LabSend module of the LabHost platform, likely leveraging a farm of dedicated mobile devices created for this purpose. Note that the fee is set to a small amount to avoid raising suspicion.\n  2. Once the target selects this link, they are directed to a highly convincing page that copies the look and feel of An Post, the Irish postal service and the legitimate entity that normally processes these kinds of customs payments. The user is then prompted to input their phone number; however, in testing, this does not need to match the targeted phone, so it does not function as a safety check.\n  3. Rather than present the user with all the details the attackers wants to gather on one screen (which might trigger suspicion) the attackers break these details up over several screens.\n  4. The fake page initially asks for the user\u2019s name and address (Eircode is a postcode system used in Ireland), then requests classic credit card details, including the security code. Once completed, all these details will be sent via the phishing page (hosted on a user of LabHost\u2019s infrastructure) to the main LabHost panel, with an alert being sent to the cybercriminal user. The user can then simply log in to LabHost and retrieve these details, or export all of the gathered credentials for a given time period.\n\nWhile this is an example of an attack against an Irish target, a similar\nattack flow exists using different brands for other regions on both mobile and\ndesktop devices. Mobile devices have an advantage for attackers since they\nfrequently lack installed security software, making users more susceptible to\ncarrying out small transactions on them without practicing due diligence. Such\nattacks not only negatively affect the target victim but also indirectly\naffect the impersonated brands themselves, potentially undermining trust and\nleading them to receive support calls for which they can do little to assist\nthe victim.\n\n## What action did law enforcement take?\n\nOn Thursday, April 18, 2024, LabHost and all linked fraudulent sites were\ndisrupted by the Metropolitan Police Service and replaced with messages\nannouncing their seizure. This operation was carried out in partnership with\nthe UK\u2019s National Crime Agency, the City of London Police, Europol, Regional\nOrganised Crime Units (ROCUs) across the UK, and other international police\nforces in close collaboration with trusted private industry organizations.\n\nIn addition, from April 14 to April 17, international law enforcement made\nseveral arrests related to criminal users of this service. International law\nenforcement also contacted hundreds more, mentioning that it knew the details\nof their activities and leaving a warning that they remain under active\ninvestigation.\n\nThe press release articulates the scale of the service, including the large\namount of money earned from it for an approximate period of two and a half\nyears, the number of fraudulent domains created, and the volume of stolen\ncredentials. The removal of this service and several of its key users will\nyield a significant impact on these types of phishing fraud attacks as a\nresult.\n\nTrend has been assisting in the investigation of LabHost along with the UK\u2019s\nMetropolitan Police Service since June 2023. During that time we have helped\nin the following:\n\n  * Investigating the infrastructure hosting the criminal service\n  * Investigating phishing pages associated with users of the service\n  * Assisting with the triage and clustering of LabHost users\n  * Launching individual investigations on several key users\n\nThis is in keeping with Trend\u2019s guiding mission to make the world safe for the\nexchange of digital information, for both our customers and non-customers\nalike. We have been collaborating with law enforcement globally for decades\nand have formal partnerships with UK law enforcement going back almost 10\nyears, with several successful operations and arrests. Such partnerships help\nus not only to proactively protect our customer base with highly timely threat\nintelligence but also expand that impact to the wider internet userbase.\n\nIn taking this action, the Metropolitan Police Service and its partners have\nhelped remove a major player in the phishing ecosystem, weakening the toolkits\nof malicious actors while also spreading uncertainty among their userbase.\nThis will have an immediate effect on the targets of phishing attacks carried\nout using the platform, thereby helping to safeguard victims (who would\nunfortunately receive messages that impersonate legitimate brands) and the\naffected brands themselves.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Metropolitan Police\nService on its lead role in this operation, its international and local law\nenforcement partners, and our fellow trusted private industry colleagues on\nall the hard work that went into this case. We look forward to many continued\nsuccessful endeavors in the future.\n\n## Key indicators\n\nThe following are the main landing pages for the now disabled service. Each of\nthese e is proactively blocked by Trend so that our customers are aware if\nanyone on their network is visiting these sites.\n\n  * labhost[.]cc (historical)\n  * labhost[.]co (historical)\n  * labhost[.]xyz (historical)\n  * labhost[.]ru (historical)\n  * lab-host[.]ru\n\nIn addition, the platform was used to generate over 40,000 fraudulent sites\nwith many new phishing URLs added daily for its customer base. Trend protects\ncustomers from these URLs using a combination of sourcing and behavioral\ndetection methods, primarily tagging them with the category \u201cPHISHKIT\u201d in our\nlogs.\n\nAs mentioned previously, other PhaaS-type services still exist, and we\ncontinue to actively monitor and provide protection for ongoing campaigns.
