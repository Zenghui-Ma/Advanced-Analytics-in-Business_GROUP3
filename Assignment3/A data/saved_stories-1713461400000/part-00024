The\nmalware's victimology, infrequent sightings, and level of stealth and\nsophistication indicate APT-level activity.\n\nWithSecure discovered overlaps between Kapeka, GreyEnergy, and Prestige\nransomware attacks which are all reportedly linked to a group known as\nSandworm. WithSecure assesses it is likely that Kapeka is a new addition to\nSandworm\u2019s arsenal. Sandworm is a prolific Russian nation-state threat group\noperated by the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of\nthe Russian Federation (GRU). Sandworm is particularly notorious for its\ndestructive attacks against Ukraine in pursuit of Russian interests in the\nregion.\n\nKapeka contains a dropper that will drop and launch a backdoor on a victim\u2019s\nmachine and then remove itself. The backdoor will first collect information\nand fingerprint both the machine and user before sending the details on to the\nthreat actor. This allows tasks to be passed back to the machine or the\nbackdoor\u2019s configuration to be updated. WithSecure do not have insight as to\nhow the Kapeka backdoor is propagated by Sandworm.\n\nKapeka\u2019s development and deployment likely follow the ongoing Russia-Ukraine\nconflict, with Kapeka being likely used in targeted attacks of firms across\nCentral and Eastern Europe since the illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIt is likely that Kapeka was used in intrusions that led to the deployment of\nPrestige ransomware in late 2022. It is probable that Kapeka is a successor to\nGreyEnergy, which itself was likely a replacement for BlackEnergy in\nSandworm\u2019s arsenal.\n\nThis report provides an in-depth technical analysis of the backdoor and its\ncapabilities, and analyzes the connection between Kapeka and Sandworm group.\nThe purpose of this report is to raise awareness amongst businesses,\ngovernments, and the broader security community. WithSecure has engaged\ngovernments and select customers with advanced copies of this report. In\naddition to the report, we are releasing several artifacts developed as a\nresult of our research, including a registry-based & hardcoded configuration\nextractor, a script to decrypt and emulate the backdoor\u2019s network\ncommunication, and as might be expected, a list of indicators of compromise,\nYARA rules, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping\n\nWith Great Research Comes Great Responsibility.\n\nResources\n\n  * Research\n  * Expertise\n  * Tools\n  * Advisories\n\nFind Labs\n\n  * Contact us\n  * GitHub\n\nWithSecureTM Company\n\n  * Contact WithSecureTM\n  * Careers at WithSecureTM\n\nWithSecureTM Newsletter\n\n  * Vulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\n\u00a9 WithSecure 2024\n\n## We value your privacy\n\nWe need your consent so that we can access cookies, unique identifiers,\npersonal data, and information on your browsing behavior on this device.
