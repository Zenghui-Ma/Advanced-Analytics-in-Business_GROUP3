Here is an edited\nversion of the conversation.\n\nHohndel, who has been involved with the kernel for a very long time, said that\nduring the past 25 years there have been many challenges, and one of the\nbiggest challenges was the possibility of fragmentation. \u201cHow do we keep one\nsingle kernel?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI used to be worried about fragmentation, and I used to think that it was\ninevitable at some point,\u201d said Torvalds. \u201cEveryone was looking at the history\nof Linux and comparing it with UNIX. People would say that it\u2019s going to fail\nbecause it\u2019s going to fragment. That\u2019s what happened before, so why even\nbother?\u201d\n\nWhat made the difference was the license. \u201cFSF [Free Software Foundation] and\nI don\u2019t have a loving relationship, but I love GPL v2,\u201d said Torvalds. \u201cI\nreally think the license has been one of the defining factors in the success\nof Linux because it enforced that you have to give back, which meant that the\nfragmentation has never been something that has been viable from a technical\nstandpoint.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Linux is immune to fragmentation. Torvalds\u2019s greatest fear\nwas that fragmentation would happen due to different markets. In the early\ndays SGI was pushing Linux into 1,000 core machines, and Linux was not ready.\nSGI wanted to talk to Torvalds about how to manage that. \u201cI said you should do\nyour own big iron version of Linux and sell it as SGI Linux,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\ndid to some degree, but they kept moving things back.\u201d\n\nGNU GPLv2 allowed merging things back. \u201cWe ended up just improving to the\npoint where our limits from the standard kernel went away and let the SGI\npeople push their code to us, so that they had less headaches with all the\nchanges they did,\u201d Torvalds said. \u201cThat experience just convinced me that,\neven if you have completely disparate machines and target markets, we really\ncan have a single image from the source code standpoint.\u201d\n\n### GNU GPL vs. other licenses\n\nGNU GPL is not the only open-source license out there. There are many more\npermissive licenses, like MIT and BSD, where you don\u2019t have to send back the\nmodifications or improvements that you made to the software, unlike GNU GPL.\n\nTorvalds said that most of the time projects started by companies show up\nunder BSD or MIT licenses because it allows them to do anything with the\nproject. \u201cThey see that as a big upstart,\u201d Torvalds said. \u201cI think that if you\nactually want to create something bigger, and if you want to create a\ncommunity around it, BSD license is not necessarily a great license.\u201d\n\nWhile these licenses have worked very well for many companies, they do make it\nhard if you are looking for outside developers who don\u2019t feel protected by a\nbig company. The company doesn\u2019t have to make any promises, because the BSD\nlicense allows both the company and the outside developer to do anything they\nwant with the code. That doesn\u2019t provide a warm fuzzy feeling.\n\nA developer would feel that the big company is going to take advantage of\ntheir work, said Torvalds. \u201cThe GPL ensures that nobody is ever going to take\nadvantage of your code. It will remain free and nobody can take that away from\nyou. I think that\u2019s a big deal for community management.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve become convinced that the BSD license is great for code\nyou don\u2019t care about,\u201d Torvalds said. He also pointed out that choosing a\nlicense for your project is a personal choice. \u201cSome people love the BSD\nlicense. Some people love the proprietary licenses. I understand that. If you\nwant to make a program and you want to feed your kids, it makes a lot of sense\nto have a proprietary license and sell binaries. I think it makes less sense\ntoday, but I really understand the argument. I don\u2019t want to judge. I\u2019m just\ngiving my view on licensing.\u201d\n\n### Growing together\n\nAs much as GPL helped Linux, in return, Linux also helped GPL. Karen Sandler,\nthe executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy said at LinuxCon\nthat the success of Linux during the past 25 years has been proof of the\nconcept of copyleft. \u201cI would like to see that extended to more free and open\nsource software projects,\u201d she said. \u201cThe full experiment of copyleft has\nnever really been tried.\u201d\n\n## Related content\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### These are the most exciting Linux powered devices\n\nDid you know that Tesla cars ran on Linux?rn\n\nBy Swapnil Bhartiya\n\nMay 22, 2017 4 mins\n\nLinux Open Source\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### How Rackspace flew through turbulence in the private cloud\n\nBryan Thompson, General Manager, OpenStack Private Cloud at Rackspace, talked\nabout the second generation of cloud and some turbulence that OpenStack\nrecently experienced.rn\n\nBy Swapnil Bhartiya\n\nMay 22, 2017 4 mins\n\nOpen Source Cloud Computing Data Center\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### How Dell\u2019s Project Sputnik came to life\n\nI met and talked to Barton George, the projectu2019s initiator and leader, to\nunderstand the backstory.\n\nBy Swapnil Bhartiya\n\nMay 22, 2017 10 mins\n\nLinux Open Source Computers and Peripherals\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### Elementary OS is trying to create a business model for open source app\ndevelopers\n\nThere is no dearth of Linux based operating systems, you will find dime a\ndozen.
