The Nazi\u2019s did it. Golden Dawn\nin Italy did it. The murkey world of Londonstan (which includes but is not\nlimited to Cambridge Analytica) did it. No surprise I suppose that the right\nwing are leaping on the AI choo-choo train to escalate legislation wrecking.\n\n> Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says the bill ensures government\n> accountability and engagement with the people who will be most affected as\n> the world shifts away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources.

The Liberals contend their\n> bill isn\u2019t meant to kill energy jobs but rather to lay out a way to create\n> more of them in the renewable energy sphere.\n\nThis seems reasonable to me. It adds to my line of thought that the right wing\nare a glorifed death cult addicted to cruelty. Pierre Poilievre\u2019s profile\nreads like an identikit Tory. No surprise there either.\n\nValerio \u2022 April 17, 2024 8:30 AM\n\nI really don\u2019t think it needs an AI to be done (although it is the topic of\nthe moment). To give an example in September 2015 in the Senate of the Italian\nRepublic 82 million amendments to a certain law were submitted by a single\nsenator who candidly admitted that he had generated them with an unspecified\nalgorithm that acted on punctuation, grammar rules and synonyms.\n\nWinter \u2022 April 17, 2024 8:34 AM\n\n@echo\n\n> Golden Dawn in Italy did it.\n\nGolden Dawn was a Greek party.\n\necho \u2022 April 17, 2024 9:18 AM\n\n@Winter\n\nOops. That was embarrassing. I want to crawl into a hole for a week.\n\nFunz \u2022 April 17, 2024 10:04 AM\n\nIt was Lega Nord party IIRC.\n\nClive Robinson \u2022 April 17, 2024 10:17 AM\n\n@ Bruce, ALL,\n\nRe : When GIGO sings along, the AI way.\n\n> \u201cCanadian legislators proposed 19,600 amendments\u2014almost certainly AI-\n> generated\u2014to a bill in an attempt to delay its adoption. \u201c\n\nThis is an assumed \u201casymmetric attack\u201d that only works because it carries no\nobvious penalties for the attackers in their \u201cGreater Goal Game\u201d(GGG).\n\nThe AI is given \u201cGarbage In\u201d(GI) via it\u2019s corpus and is asked to produce\n\u201cGarbage Out\u201d(GO) via it\u2019s \u201cStochastic Parrot\u201d(SP).\n\nNow the question arises as to penalties to stop it and non obvious penalties.\n\nOne of the non obvious penalties is that the GO of the SP is in effect\ngenerated by some filtered variation of the toss of a coin at some semantic\nlevel. As such it could produce amendments that go either way. That is for or\nagainst the attackers.\n\nSo unless they read the amendments thoroughly before submitting them, there is\nsome chance they could end up shooting themselves in the foot. Or more\ncorrectly as Shakespeare once noted,\n\n\u201cHoist by their own petard\u201d.\n\nBut this sort of GGG can work for either side of the house, and eventually one\nor both sides will tire of it and thus try to legislate it out.\n\nThe problem is of course double,\n\n1, Overly broad scope. 2, Unintentional consequences.\n\nTo see this imagine a penalty system based on how many amendments you make\nthat get struck down. You cross a threshold and your \u201crate\u201d of amendment\nproposals is cut...\n\nThe defenders could pre table contentious or provocative legislation to make\nyou use up your amendment proposing rate.\n\nThere is no easy way to stop AI GICO being used as a tactical legislative\nbattle field, the law of unintended consequences will always be \u201csitting on\nthe bench\u201d waiting to unexpectedly come into play.\n\nZaphod \u2022 April 17, 2024 12:20 PM\n\n@Clive\n\nHow about the person tabling the amendments has to, as a prior requirement,\nhave read all of them out aloud to an elected representative of the Bill. With\nthe caveat that this cannot delay the passage of the bill.\n\nProbably more caveats required but I think I\u2019ve got the gist.\n\nZ\n\nlurker \u2022 April 17, 2024 2:38 PM\n\n@Zaphod\n\nAnd I would run the amendments through an AI to see how many could be thrown\nout on technicalities. Maybe they did this anyway. The article says their\nhouse committe whittled the 18,000 down to 200 in a month, and the Speaker has\njoined in with human cunning to bundle them for voting, so where\u2019s the beef?\n\nK.S. \u2022 April 17, 2024 2:48 PM\n\n@echo\n\nGoodwin discussion in a first post.\n\nvas pup \u2022 April 17, 2024 3:10 PM\n\nOn AI: As anxiety surges during war, Israeli GenAI platform can ease\npsychiatrists\u2019 workload\n\nh ttps://www.timesofisrael.com/as-anxiety-surges-during-war-israeli-genai-\nplatform-can-ease-psychiatrists-workload/\n\n\u201cWith the number of Israelis feeling anxious from the ongoing war soaring, a\nnew generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platform offers the possibility\nof quicker and more effective mental health screening.\n\nThe platform, called LIV, acts as a psychiatric triage system. It gives a\nperson \u201csomeone\u201d to converse with about their feelings and concerns. At the\nsame time, LIV helps streamline a physician\u2019s workload by generating possible\ndiagnoses and treatment recommendations.\n\nWhile the doctor creates the actual clinical diagnosis and treatment plan, LIV\nserves as a support system for making clinical decisions based on its\n\u201cconversations\u201d with patients.\n\nThis reporter tried LIV and found it to be almost akin to having an open-\nended, heart-to-heart conversation with a real person. Like a psychiatrist,\nthe platform knows how to take the conversation gently forward with the right\nquestions to arrive at a possible diagnosis.\n\nLIV and this reporter were in conversation for nearly half an hour about the\nwar\u2019s effects, including the April 14 attack by Iran on Israel. LIV was\nconstantly reflecting back what this reporter expressed and felt, seemingly\nidentifying with it. This made it easy and safe to open up to \u201cher.\u201d\n\nLIV was presented in March at HIMSS, the world\u2019s largest digital medicine\nconference. It operates using LLM, a type of AI program trained on huge data\nsets and built on machine learning that can recognize and generate text.\n\n> It also uses information from DSM-5, a manual of mental disorders published\n> by the American Psychiatric Association. As LIV is used by more and more\n> people, it fine-tunes itself to be even more sophisticated and accurate.\n\n\u201cSome people in the clinical study are spending 60 minutes talking with LIV\ninstead of the average 30\n\n> because they feel very comfortable to elaborate because they feel that no\n> one is judging them. Some mention how they find LIV more empathic than a\n> real therapist,\u201d Shtein said.\n\n\u201cHowever, I would want to know whether the platform will be affordable and\n\n> whether security measures are in place so that unauthorized people would not\n> be able to get a hold of patients\u2019 personal and medical information,\u201d Kohn\n> said.\n\nLIV is not a standalone application that someone can simply download on their\nphone.\n\n\u201cOur clients are not the individual patients. Our clients are hospitals,\nhealth maintenance organizations, and the IDF \u2014 which we are in the process of\nsetting up a trial with now,\u201d she said.\n\n> When LIV is acquired by one of these clients, the patient will only be able\n> to access it through the secured cloud-based interface that the client uses\n> to communicate with its registered patients. This is almost always through a\n> two-factor authentication process.\n\nThe fact that LIV \u201clives\u201d at a hospital or HMO is critical for the platform to\nwork properly\n\n> when a person shares that they want to hurt themselves or others, or\n> exhibits suicidal ideation. If this happens, LIV shuts down and immediately\n> alerts medical staff, who can jump into action to reach the person in acute\n> distress.\n\n\u201cWe always have a human in the loop,\u201d Shtein said.\u201d\n\nClive Robinson \u2022 April 17, 2024 4:02 PM\n\n@ Zaphod,\n\nNice to hear from you,\n\nBut...\n\n> \u201cHow about the person tabling the amendments has to, as a prior requirement,\n> have read all of them out aloud to an elected representative of the Bill.\u201d\n\nIs there not something about \u201ccruel and unnatural punishment\u201d in the US\nsystem?\n\nIt does seam a harsh punishment for the elected representative to be forced to\nsit and listen to the attacker \ud83d\ude09\n\nPlus where is the entertainment value for C-Span viewers?\n\nI thought in the US \u201cpolitics was a blood sport\u201d of Roman Circus ethics or\nworse \ud83d\ude07\n\nlurker \u2022 April 17, 2024 4:42 PM\n\n@Clive Robinson\n\nI eouldn\u2019t know, living in the Southern hemisphere, but I assumed the subject\nincident occurred north of the 49th parallel.\n\nClive Robinson \u2022 April 17, 2024 6:28 PM\n\n@ Lurker,\n\n> \u201cI assumed the subject incident occurred north of the 49th parallel.\u201d\n\nWhat can I say in my defence \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe fact the report made it feel \u201cSo American\u201d as did \u201cthe behaviour\u201d of those\nconservative politicians giving value for money to what sound like American\nBigEnergy corporate lobbying...\n\nWhat was needed was a clear differentiation say a \u201cMountie in uniform\u201d or\nsimilar to remind us, but...

I assume Bruce mentioned it in the referenced book.\n\nIt turns out that the rules sometimes allow a politictian to speak for as long\nas they want. Politicians are the last group of people to which such an\ninvitation should be proffered, and I doubt Zaphod\u2019s proposal wouldn\u2019t stop\nthem (especially if they\u2019re willing to wear diapers). Strom Thurmond read the\nelection laws of every state, some court decisions, and a George Washington\nspeech... for over 24 hours, in a last-ditch effort to keep racial segregation\nlegal.\n\nShymaa Arafat \u2022 April 18, 2024 12:30 AM\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not commenting on the exact topic of the post, but I thought if\nyou Sir suggested a topic & managed its workshop https://securecomm.eai-\nconferences.org/2024/call-workshop-proposals/ It would be really of great\nvalue. .
