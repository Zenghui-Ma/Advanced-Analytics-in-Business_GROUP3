It is essential to sense-making and\ncooperation and so then to the fundamental processes of human life. It is\ncomplex in its operations and so in its descriptions; it means different\nthings to different people in different contexts.\n\nIn light of the deep digitalization of our world, developments in computer\nscience affect everyone. Many applications of computer science concern people\nand relationships, our interactions with each other and with digital\ntechnology, and with our cyborgian extension, and so I can only consider the\ndiligent digital mediation and augmentation of human identity to be the\ndiscipline\u2019s foremost challenge.\n\nHistoric systemizations of identity have brought advantages and disadvantages,\ngreat benefits and grave harms, and I have this in mind when observing\ncomputer scientists currently developing protocols and technologies to\nsystematize a narrow conceptualization of identity at scales and with a\npotential intensity never before contemplated let alone pursued. We need to\nhave a deeper think about this.\n\nTo help do just that, I present a categorisation of the conceptualizations of\nidentity borrowing from (Bauman 2011; Fuller et al. 1970): noun-like and verb-\nlike. The categorisation aims to portray the dangers of a singular digital-\nidentity-as-a-thing approach as starkly and as succinctly as possible without\ndemanding fluency in each and every conceptualization.\n\nThis essay is a call for a significant and urgent interdisciplinary\nintervention with the adoption of an ecological perspective. Ecology is a\nbranch of biology dedicated to the study of the relationships between living\norganisms, and in the widest sense entails the study of the interaction and\nsurvival of ideas and programs (Bateson 1979). I argue that the current mono-\ndisciplinary digital identity programme will pollute the information ecology\nof human nature and human culture and cannot end well for anyone. That\u2019s a\nfancy way to say I suspect there might be some groupthink in play here, and\nit\u2019s perilous for the rest of us to rely on it.\n\n## Introduction\n\nPut starkly, many millions of people have been excluded, persecuted, and\nmurdered with the assistance of prior identity architectures, and no other\nfacet of information technology smashes into the human condition in quite the\nsame way as digital identity (Sheldrake 2021a, e.g. Floridi 2016). This should\ngive anyone involved in digital identity cause to consider the emergent (i.e.\nunplanned) consequences of their work.\n\nBy definition, any questions regarding the technologization of human identity\nare questions of sociotechnology \u2014 involving the application of insights from\nthe social sciences to design policies and programs (Bunge 1999) \u2014 rather than\nmere technology. It\u2019s a question of designing for requisite variety (Ashby\n1991) because human society is complex, and it\u2019s a question of similarities\nand differences in the contextual perceivability and influence of similarities\nand differences. The technologization of human identity is a complex of\nembedded, embodied, extended, distributed and collective cognition (Smart et\nal. 2017), and when life is considered a trilogy of biological structure\n(autopoetic unit), environment, and cognition (Capra & Luisi 2014), the\ntechnologization of human identity is in fact a living process.\n\nWe should design for psychological, sociological, and ecological health \u2014\nself, culture, and nature \u2014 rather than mere process efficiency or\nconvenience. Naturally, self and culture and nature are interrelated and\ninterdependent, and when I refer to ecological health I'm talking about the\nresilience and flourishing of a web of life that includes us. Any design\npurview dedicated to health must then be equally expansive, demanding an\ninterdisciplinary if not transdisciplinary (Stock & Burton 2011) approach.\n\nTo contemplate the full gamut of conceptualizations of human identity is to\nentertain seeming contradictions. Identity is both stable and unstable,\nconcrete and malleable, alike and different, within and without, singular and\nmultiple, individual and collective, separate and connected, whole and\npartial, enduring and fleeting, relative and absolute, objective and\nsubjective, cause and effect.\n\nBeing so fundamental to the human condition and society, any and every\ndiscipline striving for deeper understanding of humanity necessarily builds,\nborrows, adapts, and assembles conceptualizations of identity to work into its\nown disciplinary contexts; philosophy, psychology, sociology, cultural\nstudies, theology, anthropology, ecology, linguistics, history, political\nscience, gender studies, human geography, archaeology, law, art, architecture,\ndesign, etc. One can also add economics to the list as the social science\nsloughs off its reputation for being the most insular academic pursuit. Noted\nas recently as 1999 (Camerer 1999), \u201ceconomists routinely \u2014 and proudly \u2014 use\nmodels that are grossly inconsistent with findings from psychology.\u201d\nSubsequently, \u201cthe inclusion of identity substantively changes conclusions of\nprevious economic analysis.\u201d (Akerlof & Kranton 2000)\n\nOne might say that computer science is the most recent discipline to\ncontemplate questions of identity. I will argue that it is accurate to call it\nthe laggard. I do not refer to those social scientists drawn to investigate\nthe effects of digital technologies on human identity, a rich field of study,\nbut rather those immersed in the theory and practice of software architecture,\nprotocol design, and their realisation in code. A qualitative assessment of\ntheir embrace of similar building, borrowing, adapting, and assembling, or\nmore accurately lack of evidence thereof, indicates that, with very rare\nexception, they appear simply to adopt a mindset for encoding identity\nborrowed entirely from its earlier bureaucratic encoding. It would seem\nunlikely that lawmakers and bureaucrats had this imitation and expansion in\nmind when conceiving and operationalising personhood (of the human being) in\nthe eyes of the state, not least in light of the automatic, unseen, and\npotentially more insidious nature of technical code in comparison to its legal\nforebear (Lessig 1999).\n\nThe conceptualization of identity predominating computer science today does\nnot accommodate the complexity nor symmathesy \u2014 contextual mutual learning\nthrough interaction (Bateson 2015) \u2014 of human identity as other disciplines\nconceptualise it working in the world. Most critically, this current mainstay\nof software architectures cannot be adapted to make such accommodations. It is\nnot predicated on the digital augmentation of human identity, by which I mean\nthe forming of digital technologies to best serve the human condition and\nsocietal well-being as described by those disciplines dedicated to such\nconcerns. It is not predicated on the cyborgian expansion of human\ninteractions and so relationships and so identity and so collective meaning-\nand sense-making (Bateson 1972; Wheatley & Kellner-Rogers 1998, Steigler\n2010). Arguably, if it isn\u2019t grounded in the pursuit of learning and meaning-\nmaking, it can\u2019t even be considered the product of human-centred design\n(Giacomin 2014).\n\nParadoxically in the context of information technology, digital identity is\nnot premised on identity as informational form at all; rather, digital\nidentity follows \u2018habeo corpus, ergo sum\u2019 rather than \u2018cogito, ergo sum\u2019. It\nis founded on mechanistic thinking, on industrialisation, on the bureaucratic,\nunitary and atomistic objectification of human bodies.\n\nDigital identity today isn\u2019t really human at all.\n\nWhile advocates of an approach known as self-sovereign identity (SSI) make\nclaims for its prioritisation of user security, privacy, individual autonomy\nand self-empowerment (Giannopoulou & Wang 2021), it is fundamentally a\nmutation carrying computer science\u2019s false premise further into community. As\nit is widely regarded as the state of the art, as it is presented by its\nchampions as the culmination of everything that came before, I will focus my\ncritique on it rather than all variations, historic and contemporary, of\ndigital identity.\n\n## In conversation\n\nConversation always relies upon contexts. We work to grow shared understanding\nthrough conversation, through interaction, and the relationship between\nconversationalists forms and evolves in the process. The contextual\nrelationship is immanent in such informational exchange (Bateson 1972).\n\nIdentity, in what you might call a natural sense, is reciprocally defining and\nco-constitutive with relationships and information exchange (Wheatley &\nKellner-Rogers 1996, 1998). Identities are immanent in contextual\nrelationships, and relationships are immanent in information exchange. A\nperson is a person through other persons (Birhane 2017).\n\nThis observation moves our framing from monologism, in which individuals and\nsocieties are considered the analytical primes, to dialogism, which instead\nemphasises actions and interactions, including contextual discourse.\nConsequently, we should, \u201cin the analysis of action and meaning, talk about\nindividuals-in-dialogue-with-partners-and-contexts rather than individuals\ntout court.\u201d (Linell 1998)\n\nIn other words, the dots (the nodes, the people) don\u2019t simply define the joins\n(the edges, the relationships) as Social Networking 101 might have it. We dot\nthe joins in contextual information exchange just as much as we might be said\nto join the dots. The joins are the pathways for information exchange and\ntransformation, for organising, and the expansion of organisational identity.\nJoins give the dots their meaning, their contextual relevance, their identity,\njust as dots give the information exchange direction and potency. I understand\nGrigg (2021) to reach similar conclusions through embedded research and\npractice.\n\nWe may have different joins involving the \u2018same\u2019 (in the corporeal sense)\nperson, but as the joins are contextual and the information exchanges are\ndistinct, the person is informationally distinct, including to herself.\n\nWe continually update our understanding of others, specifically the role the\nothers play in the internal narratives we each maintain to help us make sense\nof the world. We update our contextualised understanding of our various selves\nin these storylines too, and sometimes a variant self is spawned, and now and\nthen one fades with irrelevance.\n\n> The network self view envisions an enriched self and multiple possibilities\n> for self-determination, rather than prescribing a particular way that selves\n> ought to be. ... Selves are not only \u2018networked\u2019, that is, in social\n> networks, but are themselves networks. By embracing the complexity and\n> fluidity of selves, we come to a better understanding of who we are and how\n> to live well with ourselves and with one another. (Wallace 2021)\n\nOur identities, our selves, are formed through internal narratives; the\ninternal narrative is informed by the interactions; the interactions are\nmodulated by the identities (Schechtman 2011). This process is social,\nreciprocal, concurrent, and forever in flux, encompassing selves and groups,\nsimilarities and differences, enduring and fleeting qualities, indeed any\ninformation cognitionally useful in the formation and re-formation of\nidentities as the sense-making capacity of every organising. Such capacity is\ninherently transcontextual i.e. contingent on the potentials through which\ncontexts may juxtapose and meld to form a complex system (Bateson 2018).\n\nFoucault conceived of subjectivity, of self, as \u201ca reality ontologically\ndistinct from the body\u201d; a form rather than a substance, \u201cnot primarily or\nalways identical to itself\u201d (Kelly 2013), not too dissimilar from qualities\nSimmel described over a century ago (Simmel 2009). The subject is self-\nconstituted through practices devoid of enduring content, but undoubtedly\nsubject to the culture and influenced by the social practices at any point in\ntime. One has the capacity and propensity to change continuously, assuming\nmultiple forms concurrently. After Foucault, Hall (1996) conceptualises late-\nmodern identity negatively as not signalling the \"stable core of the self,\nunfolding from beginning to end through all the vicissitudes of history\nwithout change.\" He regards identities as \"fragmented and fractured; never\nsingular but multiply constructed across different, often intersecting and\nantagonistic, discourses, practices and positions.\"\n\nYet from personal experience in conversation with those who identify\nthemselves as working in digital identity, such articulations of identity\noften startle because human identity often operates invisibly. We are hardly\naware of it most of the time. In good part, it seems to be an innately\nsubconscious process and patterning, as natural and as essential as breathing.\nIt is fundamental to the facilities to organise and cooperate that have\ncarried our species forward (Margulis & Sagan 1997), and is consequently very\ndeeply ingrained.\n\n## The computer science approach\n\nIn complete contrast, bureaucratic identity systems are a new invention, no\nmore than mere centuries old in current continuous forms (Scott 1998). They\nare comparatively simple, readily apparent and front of mind. The documents\nand devices accompanying systems such as legal identity and IAM (identity and\naccess management) (Witty et al. 2003) are often tangible, the associated\nprocesses are visible, and the lexicon is explicit: \u201cpassports please\u201d;\n\u201cusername: password:\u201d.\n\nThere is a chasmic disconnect between the conceptualizations of identity that\ncan only regard the unitary atomistic self as illusory and the everyday\nexperience in which that illusion appears very real (Turkle 1999). Phrasing my\npersonal experience differently, I find that many people working on digital\nidentity today understand their undertaking solely in this bureaucratic\ncontext, even if they deny it, and they appear to operate therefore under the\nillusion that this somehow describes and supports our selves, culture, and\nnature, or at least has the qualities to do so.\n\nIdentity has been defined in the context of identity management systems as\n\u201cthat set of permanent or long-lived temporal attributes associated with an\nentity\u201d, and attributes defined as \u201ca characteristic associated with an\nentity, such as an individual.\u201d (Camp 2004) Eye colour and date of birth are\nexamples of persistent attributes, and one\u2019s address is an example temporary\nattribute. Long-lived attributes include social security numbers and passport\nnumbers. An identifier distinguishes an entity within a specific namespace,\nand a personal identifier consists of those attributes associated with a\nperson \u201cthat are difficult or impossible to alter\u201d. A useful identifier offers\na means to associate other attributes with the person, and the process of\nidentification associates a personal identifier with an individual presenting\nattributes.\n\nComputer science may take solving the \u201cproblem of a global and universally\ntrusted digital identity system \u2014 or, more specifically, lack of it,\u201d as the\nultimate goal (Bazarhanova & Smolander 2020). As for that namespace, the\naspiration to create some sort of global namespace in which each unique human\nis represented uniquely crops up not infrequently amongst those delighted to\nhave achieved the same for machines (Baier et al. 2003; \u201cGlobaliD: Identity\nfor everyone. Everywhere.\u201d n.d.).\n\nFor a discipline dedicated to the technological grappling with information,\nthe informational qualities of complex human actions, interactions, relations,\nand minds are largely ignored in favour of a simplistic obsession with the\ncorporeal. For example, \u201cdigital identity can be defined as the digital\nrepresentation of the information known about a specific individual or\norganisation\u201d, exemplified by reference to social security number and the idea\nof a \u201creal world individual\u201d (Bertino et al. 2009). Quite typically, Bertino\net al do not entertain any conception of identity that isn\u2019t directly related\nto corporeality. Even when psychological and sociological aspects are\ndiscussed (Rannenberg et al. 2009), digital identity is reduced to the\nrepresentation of an atomized individual in a database, particularly\npertaining to values associated to a set of attributes, perhaps because\ndigital identity is or was considered to be a separable concern from identity\n\u2018in real life\u2019, as common parlance has it.\n\nSullivan (2018) traces the roots of digital identity to the early uptake of\ninformation technology by the bureaucracy, by government services. In seeking\nto drive efficiencies and reduce fraud the idea of one-person-one-identity\nbecame and remains systemically essential, influencing adoption by the private\nsector in turn. Some nations \u2014 e.g. Austria, Belgium, Estonia \u2014 designed for\nthe government to become the de facto identity provider, and Sullivan argues\nthat such an outcome is inevitable whether by design or not. Laurent et al\n(2015) insist that the state needs to address problems such as tax evasion,\ninformation security, and online harassment, by intervening and defining \u201can\nadequate investigation, identification and sanction system.\u201d Al-Kouri (2014)\nargues that a government initiated digital identity management system is a\npriority in supporting development of the digital economy. Governments appear\nto be responding (e.g. European Commission 2021, The Government of the United\nKingdom 2021).\n\nSullivan observes a pattern entailing the elision of identity contexts and\ntransactional contexts, effectively investing transactions with legal\npersonality. More prosaically, the pizza order becomes contingent upon the\nstate\u2019s recognition of personhood (legal identity). As and when transactions\nare integral to or a precursor to social community, such participation is also\nimbued with legal personality.\n\nFacebook\u2019s controversial insistence on the use of \u2018real names\u2019 is well\ndocumented (e.g. Boyd 2011). While Facebook does not (yet) require proof of\nlegal identity, Zoom, the proprietary video conferencing service provider,\nintends to introduce the capability for customers to link their legal identity\nto their Zoom profile (Zoomtopia 2021 Keynote 2021). \u201cIn the world of deep\nfakes and identity theft, it\u2019s becoming increasingly important to verify the\nuser\u2019s identity.\u201d The company believes we should \u201cfeel confident that the\nperson at the other end is indeed who we think they are\u201d, which corresponds to\nFacebook\u2019s rationale (Grinberg 2014). It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to\nenvisage this becoming a social norm, especially should the Zoom application\u2019s\nuser interface clearly distinguish \u2018authenticated people\u2019 with an attractive\ngraphical icon. Telegram, the popular cloud-based messaging system, describes\na similar capability (\u201cIntroducing Telegram Passport\u201d 2018), and one can\neasily imagine business models developing along the lines of ZoomID-as-a-\nservice and Telegram-Passport-as-a-service. To be clear, online abuse is\ndisgusting, but we must ensure that the medicine is not worse than the malady.\n\nI have referred to such pervasive consequences as creep (Sheldrake 2019a), but\nwhile the word is appropriate in conveying expansion into unexpected areas and\nrogue behaviour, it also conveys a slowness ill-suited to the speed with which\nsuch effects may leap from objects of academic interest to common, stubborn\nand distressing social outcomes soon enough. I will switch now to describing\nsuch consequences as pollution; a pollution of the information ecology of\nhuman nature and human culture. For the avoidance of any confusion, pollution\nis contextual; a thing or process may be both highly prized and a pollutant\nsimultaneously subject to contexts, and the art then is to constrain its\napplication accordingly. Everything depends on knowing how much; good is\nknowing when to stop (Morrison 1987).\n\n## Inherited property\n\nDespite a reputation in some parts to the contrary, distributed ledger\ntechnologies including blockchain are far from immune from such polluting\neffects. The powerful, unprecedented situational qualities that get people\nexcited hold negative as well as positive potential. Mastery in realising\npositive effects demands equal mastery in appreciating and designing out the\nnegative. I will attempt to throw some light on this complex by example.\n\nGiven the transactional nature of the earliest applications of such\ntechnologies and legitimate concerns for their use in money laundering and\nother fraudulent activities, the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force\n(FATF) has encouraged an industry-led response (Campbell-Verduyn & H\u00fctten\n2021) and, increasingly, a regulatory response from governments around the\nworld (The Financial Action Task Force 2022). This includes the adoption by\ncryptocurrency exchanges of anti-money laundering processes including \u2018know\nyour customer\u2019 (KYC) identification. This is reassuring in one context and\nconcerning in many more others. While financial transacting is the first and\ncurrently preeminent application of such technologies, there are many other\ncurrent and future applications of the same technology in which money\nlaundering \u2014 and therefore legal identity in the context of money laundering \u2014\nis irrelevant.\n\nEthereum is one such technology, the largest of its kind at this time\nfeaturing smart contract functionality (Zheng et al. 2020). While it is common\nin my experience for technology practitioners to fail to define their working\nconceptualization of identity, Ethereum\u2019s progenitor notes: \u201cFirst of all, by\nidentity, I mean attempts to identify properties of the physical human being\nthat controls a particular cryptographic key.\u201d (Buterin 2020) Additionally, he\nhas championed the use of Ethereum keys for authentication to other systems\n(Things that matter outside of defi 2021); i.e. \u2018Sign-in with Ethereum\u2019 (Ryan\n2021). Occasional collaborators of his (Immorlica et al. 2019) assert: \u201cIn an\nidentity system, it is important that each individual corresponds to a single\nidentity.\u201d Siddarth et al (2020) state that \u201cFor blockchain networks to move\nfrom strictly providing financial services into enabling social and political\napplications, decentralized protocols for verifying unique human identities\nmust be devised.\u201d\n\nSuch criteria appear to inherit and lean on computer science\u2019s dominant\nconceptualization of identity, or else, where the goal may be described first\nand foremost in terms of a particular system of governance, they are, like\ncomputer science, heirs of the governing bureaucracy\u2019s conceptualization.\nThese declarations can only be valid then with qualifications. They are made\nsolely in pursuit of digitalized democracy or some other social order that\nrequires the system to strive for and maintain one-person-one-identifier; i.e.\na system in which the bodily evaluation of persons is cardinal. It would then\nbe more precise and advantageous to the health of the broader ecology, as we\nshall see, to increase the specificity of such declarations in order to design\nfor contextual constraint. For example, the earlier quote (Immorlica et al.\n2019) might then become: In a system designed for and constrained to the\ncontexts of digitalized democracy or wealth distribution it is important that\neach individual is represented just once.\n\nFor Gregory Bateson (1972), ecological understanding demands focus on the\nqualitative structure of contexts rather than the intensity of interaction.\n\u201cOut of context, the best minds do the worst damage.\u201d (Wes Jackson, as quoted\nin Berry 2009)\n\n## An ecological system\n\nEcology is a branch of biology dedicated to the study of the relationships\nbetween living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment. It\nconsiders organisms at the individual, population, community, ecosystem, and\nbiosphere levels. Ecological science is inherently multidisciplinary (Capra &\nLuisi 2014).\n\nWhile subjective, identification of the ecological system to which I refer\nhere is not arbitrary (Cumming & Peterson, 2017). I identify it as digitally\nnetworked, mediated and augmented human life; necessarily including\nperceiving, thinking, and acting. The digital aspects of this system were once\nreferred to as futuristic, and then as \u201calways on\u201d, and now digital technology\nis so embedded in and integral to quotidian systems, even ones that don\u2019t\nimmediately present themselves as digitalized, that such phrases denoting the\npresence or continuous application of digital technology no longer maintain\ndescriptive power. This is an important context when considering how identity\nworks in the world and might work in the future. We can no longer contemplate\ninformation technologies as separate from humanity, as merely tools used by\nhumanity. We are digitalized (Bratton 2015; Floridi 2015).\n\nThe suffix \u201c-ome\u201d is used to denote the object of a biological field of study\n(eg, genome, interactome, connectome, biome), and so \u201cinternetome\u201d is a\nneologism taking the digital networking, mediation and augmentation of\nourselves and our world as a biological field of study (Sheldrake 2021d).\n\nThe word isn\u2019t proffered merely for novelty\u2019s sake but to encourage computer\nscientists to embrace interdisciplinary collaboration when grappling with\nliving systems. In an internetome mindset, nobody starts with technological\nresponses to immediate social, commercial, or bureaucratic goals. Rather, we\nfirst establish a common and deep understanding of life, of living processes,\nof human life and cognition and social mechanisms, of our inseparable\ninterweave with other lifeforms and our physical environment, and conceive\ndesign challenges relating to the ecological system\u2019s health, flourishing,\ngenerativity.\n\nMy use of generativity relates to a desired state beyond sustainability that\nmay be described in terms of participating as nature and embracing co-\nevolution of the whole system (Reed 2007). Generativity encompasses a system\u2019s\ncapacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and\nuncoordinated audiences, and in our context that system necessarily includes\npeople, specifically the perceptual, cognitive and behavioural effects of\nintegrating technology into our lives (Zittrain 2006). A technology can never\nbe described as generative in some hypothetical isolation from its inevitable\nsocial contexts (Sheldrake 2021b).\n\nIf the internetome is to develop generatively, digitally mediated and\naugmented human identity must be approached primarily for psychological,\nsociological, and ecological health. For brevity, I refer to this intention as\ngenerative identity (Sheldrake 2019a).\n\n## Decentralization, a means\n\nA decade ago, when centralized social platforms seemed unstoppable, many\nassumed that a single, unified user identity might be convenient, appropriate,\nand sufficient, even if that conflicted with a human-centred perspective\n(Farnham & Churchill 2011). Being open, decentralized, and incorruptible,\nEthereum and similar technologies may be seen to offer similar benefits while\nholding the potential to address the corresponding concerns for concentrations\nof power, but that does not automatically translate to the enhancement of\nhuman agency or to a healthy ecological system more generally.\nDecentralization is a means to an end, not an end in itself (Schneider 2019).\nAdvocacy for the application of distributed ledger technologies is only\nmeaningful when its champions articulate the change they\u2019re seeking to effect,\nnecessarily inviting interdisciplinary perspectives, contributions and\ncollaboration in the process.\n\nAs with all complex adaptive systems, system properties other than the degree\nof (de)centralization are inevitably in play. For example, while the FATF\u2019s\nwork and the pursuit of digitalized democracy have legitimacy in their own\ncontexts, their consequences are undesirable and illegitimate in other\ncontexts shared by and important to exactly the same social groups; e.g.\ncontexts entailing the nature of being human, good mental health, and the full\nexpanse of healthy human relations and community. Attention is required at a\nfundamental layer, low in the stack as technical parlance has it, to enable\nthe pursuit of legitimated higher-level initiatives without one such endeavour\ninevitably polluting the viability of another, or indeed of very many others\n(see Nottingham 2022). Such pollution leads, definitionally, to a system with\ndamaging psychological and sociological effects, which in turn may lead to\necological collapse.\n\nThe blockchain community develops and applies cryptographic primitives (Wang\net al. 2019). Applications of such technology in human community are\ndefinitionally social, so we can ask \u2014 what might constitute\n'sociotechnological primitives'? Assemblages of such primitives might be\nformed and reformed, forked and merged and forked again, to suit initiatives\nin respectful social (cultural) and bioregional (environmental) contexts in\npursuing and sustaining a global harmony (Sheldrake 2020a) or, with rose-\ntinted glasses put aside, a plateau of intensity, \u201ca situation of constant\nevolution and becoming in which conflict does not build, but is expressed and\nreleased.\u201d (Deleuze and Guattari, as discussed by Shaw 2015)\n\nWhile I have found little discussion of autopoiesis and cognition amongst the\nidentity digerati, the underlying preconditions and mechanisms for both are\nfundamental in the internetome and may only be ignored with traumatic\nconsequences. While the evolution of the system will inevitably entail trial\nand error, of course, we might learn from our species\u2019 recent history of\nsimplistic and so catastrophic ecological interventions. Confusing a means for\nthe ends is never going to be a good start.\n\n## I seem to be a verb\n\n> ... \u2018identity\u2019, though ostensibly a noun, behaves like a verb, albeit a\n> strange one to be sure: it appears only in the future sense. Though all too\n> often hypostasized as an attribute of a material entity, identity has the\n> ontological status of a project and a postulate. (Bauman 2011)\n\nComputer scientists have joined a very small minority group adopting a\ncategory of conceptualizations of identity I call noun-like. Such\nconceptualizing treats identity as unchanging and not infrequently corporeal.\nI am a singular object. You are a different singular object. I am the same as\nthe five year-old going to his first day at school. You are the same person\ntoday as the first day of your first job. This is the case irrespective of the\nsystem architecture. As the World Economic Forum notes accurately (2018),\n\u201cDecentralized identity systems don\u2019t depend on a single system owner or set\nof owners to establish and manage identities.\u201d While this sentence sets out to\ndescribe a quality of decentralized systems, it also imparts that, centralized\nor decentralized, identities are things to be managed.\n\nLaw adopts a noun-like approach to identity in coding society, although in\nmaking accommodations for the age of majority, circumstances of diminished\nresponsibility, and freedom of thought, one might conclude it stretches a\nlittle further in adapting to the real world than our current digital\ninfrastructure.\n\nOn discussing identity in group situations I always ask how many times people\nhave resorted to noun-like identity so far this century. The timespan\npurposefully starts at a time when one\u2019s experiences of digital services\nextended perhaps to the noun-like login to the IT system at work, perhaps a\npersonal email account, proof of ID at the bank branch or authentication at\nthe ATM, the occasional need to produce a passport for international travel,\nthe right to vote, and proof of ID to hire a car or secure a mortgage product.\nOutside of the digital context, estimates of the frequency with which noun-\nlike identity is invoked mostly range between one and five dozen times a year\nat the turn of the century.\n\nContrast this with the verb-like. Such conceptualizations consider identity to\nbe dynamic, multiple, informational, temporary, contextual. Whereas the noun-\nlike conceptualizations attach actions and interactions to actors, the verb-\nlike recognise that identity is co-emergent with actions and interactions in\ncontexts. The noun-like are functionally relational whereas the verb-like are\nco-emergently relational. The vast majority of disciplines (per the\nIntroduction) for which human identity is a concern conceive it in a verb-like\nmanner.\n\nIn discussing verb-like identity I find people first gravitate to\ncontemplating differences in years, contrasting one\u2019s childhood and adulthood\nfor example, as I did above. So-called life-changing events then pop into\ntheir thoughts such as rites of passage, marriage, parenthood, careers,\nrelocations, hormonal changes. Someone they know changed radically. Someone\nelse behaves quite differently in one situation from another. They may reflect\non the cognitive decline of an older friend or relative, and eventually\nmultiple contextual self-descriptions emerge, so-called narrative selves. On\nasking about the frequency with which the verb-like manifest, responses move\nquickly from claims for daily to hourly to recognition that we are discussing\na continuous process. Eventually someone in the group notes that it\u2019s\nhappening right now in our conversation.\n\nVerb-like identity is essential to human life. The associated cognitive\nprocesses are at the heart of the human condition and human society.\nNevertheless, modern life is increasingly pierced and pinned down by the\npersistent informational splinters of noun-like identity systems, and this is\nset to grow exponentially. Noun-like identity systems are ripe to penetrate\nthe micro-interactions of everyday life, to pollute our lived experience, and\nyet from observation, too few people working on \u201cbringing digital identity to\nmarket\u201d, a turn of phrase that is entirely inappropriate in itself, recognise\nthe potential malignancy of their inventions. Enabling the relentless spread\nof noun-like identity in general, and legal identity in particular, is\npresented as progress and indeed as necessary.\n\nNevertheless, while they may not employ the categorizations of noun-like and\nverb-like, there are frequent references amongst those researching digital\nidentity from a social sciences perspective to the associated phenomena. Here\nare four examples:\n\n> Digital identity can be understood as a continuum. At one end we find the\n> \u2018simpler\u2019 or \u2018narrow view\u2019 where digital identity is \u2018a collection of\n> credentials online\u2019 used in electronic transactions ... In contrast, the\n> other end of the spectrum is characterised as the \u2018fundamental side\u2019 or the\n> \u2018broader view\u2019. Here digital identity is understood to be \u2018the online\n> representation of one\u2019s self\u2019 or \u2018one\u2019s representation in a digital space\u2019.\n> (Warburton 2010)\n\n> ... identity is always online. We are, in some ways, always performing\n> ourselves online because even when we are nowhere near a digital\n> communication device (which is now extremely rare), we leave traces all over\n> the Internet ... Identity and its online representation is therefore not\n> something we switch off, move away from, or otherwise demarcate from the\n> everyday practices of selfhood. (Cover 2015)\n\n> People have always had, and managed, multiple personal identities. ... there\n> is a tension between fixed identities within rigid systems and people\u2019s\n> shifting, dynamic lives. Identification systems in general and digital\n> systems in particular make static aspects of people\u2019s identity in ways that\n> are often outside their control. (Bailur et al. 2017)\n\n> ... the recently proclaimed hopes in the development of digital identity\n> could be both na\u00efve and dangerous. Rather than just asking ourselves how we\n> could digitize existing features of identity management, and corresponding\n> financial transactions on a community or state level, we submit that truly\n> useful and innovative digital identities need to be accompanied by some\n> significant rethinking of the essential basics behind the organisation of\n> the world. [... There is] a clear risk that when implemented at the global\n> scale, such decentralized systems could be deeply harmful, reinforcing and\n> amplifying the most repugnant aspects of contemporary citizenship. (Gstrein\n> & Kochenov 2020)\n\n## Mind over matter\n\n\u201cMind is empty; it is no-thing. It exists only in its ideas, and these again\nare no-things.\u201d As for ideas: the \u201csmallest unit of mental process is a\ndifference, or distinction, or news of a difference\u201d, which aligns with the\ndefinition of information as \u201cany difference that makes a difference.\u201d\n(Bateson 1979) On the one hand then we have the bodily definition of a person,\nincluding her brain, a biological organ; and on the other hand, we have the\ninformational nature of mind, a no-thing that isn\u2019t bound by a corporeal\nentity by definition. For me, this distinction resolves the four perspectives\nexpressed immediately above.\n\nFor any discussion on the whys and wherefores of digital identity, for any\ndiscussion about anything, we rely on a substantial corpus of information that\ncannot be said to be located anywhere per se; the ideas and meanings of\n\u201cdigital\u201d for example, and \u201cidentity\u201d. Such meanings are contextual;\ninformation situated within information. Anyone who has joined a well-\nestablished group can relate to this. While you may not use such words or\nrefer to such concepts, as you \u2018onboard\u2019 you can reflect on the social nature\nof mind and consider mind as a mass noun. You will likely perceive a coherence\nof meaning- and sense-making amongst longer-serving team members that becomes\nless obvious as one\u2019s membership endures; the distinction dissolves as your\ninformational self coheres into and expands the collective mind.\n\nThis observation is made during the expansion of the knowledge economy, i.e.\nthe growing emphasis of knowledge-intensive work over labour-intensive work,\nof mind and thinking and conversation and creativity over physical presence\nand labouring by the hour.\n\nNow imagine two extremes of internetome. In one, systems at all scales\nindividuate the body and so the blancmange of the organ sheltered by the\nskull. This vision entails digital inventories in which our corporeal beings\nare reduced to stock-keeping units, a systemic individuation that, through its\ncoercive enrolment and manipulative constraining of verb-like identity, leads\nto abjectivity (Haque 2019), disindividuation (Steigler 2010), and the\npsychological effect of deindividuation (Reicher et al. 1995). One is one in\nvarious structural representations of populations, but one is \u201cshort-\ncircuited\u201d, one loses one\u2019s self and social identity in such homogeneous and\nrelentless programmatic regimentation. The social identity with which one is\nleft is compulsory and so no real substitute for lost voluntary affiliation\nlet alone replacement for more private selfhood.\n\nIn the other internetome, the augmenting and amplifying of mind is treasured\nand perhaps adopted as a primary design goal. You might express it in terms of\nfreedom of mind, freedom of thought, freedom of choice, freedom of assembly,\nimagination, love, spiritualism, social compute, collective meaning- and\nsense-making, and / or intelligence. By intensifying rich and diverse\ninformation flows, this future internetome retains the potential to flourish\nas a regenerative ecological system.\n\nI will refer to them as the degenerative internetome (noun-like, corporeal)\nand generative internetome (verb-like, mind) respectively.\n\nIn his synthesis of life and mind, Thompson (2010) offers up a system\ndescription that applies equally here if you accept my assertion that the\npursuit of generative identity is inseparable from and integral to digitalized\nlife and mind. The incongruity of noun-like identity is visceral.\n\n> [E]verything is process all the way \u2018down\u2019 and all the way \u2018up\u2019, and\n> processes are irreducibly relational \u2013 they exist only in patterns,\n> networks, organisations, configurations, or webs. In the process view, \u2018up\u2019\n> and \u2018down\u2019 are context-relative terms used to describe phenomena of various\n> scales and complexity. There is no base level of elementary entities to\n> serve as the ultimate \u2018emergent base\u2019 on which to ground everything.\n> Phenomena at all scales are not entities but relatively stable processes,\n> and since processes achieve stability at different levels of complexity,\n> while still interacting with processes at other levels, all are equally real\n> and none has absolute ontological primacy.\n\nSo long as humanity needs bureaucratic processes in their current form, even\nthe most mundane of them can be accommodated in the generative internetome\u2019s\nrequisite variety. Generative identity processes can and will stabilise for\nsufficient duration.\n\nIn the meantime, applications of noun-like identity must be kept as rare and\ndistinct as they have been historically if we are to oscillate less violently\naround life\u2019s equilibria. By dint of its innate facility for change, for co-\nevolution, the generative internetome is the only one of the two in which the\nAnthropocene can work out well for our species and those with which we share\nthe planet. Tactically speaking, we must become masterful in working with\nverb-like conceptualizations in our digitalized life and remain deeply\nsuspicious of the coding and application of the noun-like.\n\n## I\u2019m told I\u2019m self-sovereign\n\nHumans are social animals. Community, and more accurately cooperation, is\nessential to our surviving and thriving (Margulis & Sagan 1997; Nowak &\nHighfield 2011). Organising community entails governance at many scales, and\nwe refer to the activities of governance as politics. All sociotechnology \u2014\nrelating to the technologization of human organising \u2014 is therefore political.\n\nSelf-sovereign identity (SSI) is premised on simplistic political dogma. Just\nlike all simplistic political dogma, it breaks as soon as sufficient pain is\nfelt by sufficient numbers of people retaining the power to revolt. The SSI\ncommunity, if I can refer to a group identity, believes that 'giving' Alice\nher 'self-sovereignty' frees her, when in fact it requires that she conforms\nto one particular political worldview. The system subsumes her and her\nnetworks, both internal and external.\n\nSSI emanates from the western states of the USA, a region not unfamiliar with\nthe temptations of technosolutionism and the myths of the lone cowboy. For me,\nWeyl (2020) nails the context of the SSI community with his description of\nALONE: Atomistic Liberalism and Objectivist Naive Epistemology.\n\n> Central to ALONE is a binary between Individuals, conceptualized as largely\n> presocial, independent ultimate loci of value / preference / good / belief\n> (well-being for short), and some global coordination device variously\n> referred to as the social planner, objective truth, the modeler, the\n> mechanism designer, the impartial observer, God or, most commonly and how I\n> will refer to it, The State.\n\nEverything in between is secondary, a distraction that can either be automated\naway or ignored. All keen students of complex adaptive systems will share\nWeyl\u2019s inevitable conclusion that \"the ALONE model of the world is wildly\nna\u00efve and inaccurate\".\n\nThe SSI community, emanating from and largely operating with the ALONE\nparadigm, sets out in good part to remove The State as the issuer of identity,\nbut caught in the binary thinking characteristic of ALONE, replaces it with\nsomething less social, less easily governed, less accountable, less easily\nrestrained and more insidious, in stark opposition to the social layers and\nnorms and institutions and mechanisms integral to what might be referred to as\nhigh-trust societies and indeed the trust-based essence of all human community\n(Cook 2001; Fukuyama 1995; O\u2019Hara & Hutton 2004). Renieris (2021) describes\nthe SSI framework as based on the \u201cneoliberal fallacy of individual choice &\ncontrol.\u201d\n\nMy analysis is not predicated on either individualism or communitarianism. To\nGiddens (2014), social structure and personal agency are inseparable as two\nsides of the same coin. Structures may be constraining and may be enabling.\nThe repeated actions of many individuals reproduce and indeed change the\nsocial structure, a structure defined in terms of rules and resources that\nenable such reproduction over time rather than as some dominating external\nforce (Giddens, 1986; Giddens and Sutton, 2014). This pillar of contemporary\nsociological theory moves from dividing our object of study into separate,\npaired elements, to considering them interdependent, no longer separate or\nopposed; from a dualism to a duality (William A. Jackson 1999). In this sense,\ngenerative identity is neither individualistic nor communitarian; information\nhas no scale.\n\nI have yet to come across a sociology reference in SSI literature (the sole\ndissenting chapter in the most recent and most comprehensive book on the topic\nis the exception; but then I wrote it (Sheldrake 2021a)). The SSI community\u2019s\nsacred texts (Allen 2016; Cameron 2005) make no mention. They don\u2019t just fall\nshort of describing verb-like conceptualizations of human identity, they run\ncounter to the understanding of most every other discipline with an interest\nin identity. In conversation (the Humanetics workshop series, Summer 2021), I\nbelieve that Allen now recognises as much himself. A more recent collaborative\neffort to distil key principles (\u201cPrinciples of SSI\u201d 2020) makes no material\ndifference as far as the critique here goes.\n\nThe paradox for those drawn to individualization and so-called self-\nsovereignty is that the ultimate qualities they seek, not least including and\nemanating from freedom of thought, cannot be found within systemic corporeal\nindividuation but rather with systems that value and augment the cognitive\nessence of the human condition. This does not deny the salience of the body,\nquite the opposite. It situates the dignity of every single human being in the\npotential to make a difference with and through others: to sense, to think, to\nlearn, to express, to assemble, to act, to love.\n\n## What do we mean by \u201cdigital\u201d?\n\nDelving into the \u201cdigital identity\u201d mind by reading its texts, watching its\npresentations, examining its architectures and protocols, and conversing, it\u2019s\nclear that \u201cdigital\u201d relates to computers, to software code, to databases, to\nthe internet, to the web, and to information processed and transported by such\nmachinery. To reflect on \u201cdigital identity\u201d then is to consider some form of\nprocessing of digital information in digital systems that might be taken as\nrepresenting an individual or claims made about an individual.\n\nDigital identity is also digital at a more fundamental level: \u201ca signal is\ndigital if there is discontinuity between it and alternative signals from\nwhich it must be distinguished. Yes and no are examples of digital signals.\u201d\n(Bateson 1979)\n\nThe digital is non-analogic. The information that my legal name is Philip\nSheldrake is digital information without involving any modern technology. That\nit isn\u2019t George Clooney is digital information. In the simplest terms, you\nwon\u2019t stumble upon a digitally technologized identification and authentication\nprocess for which the output is possibly or perhaps. I distinguish between the\noutput of the process and any consequential conclusion. Levels Of Assurance\nfor example (\u201cLevels of assurance (LOAs)\u201d 2019) maps the digital outputs of\nauthentication processes to an ordinal scale.\n\nThe analogue is non-digital. The brain is analogue. Mind is analogue. How my\nwife, my parents, my friends, my work colleagues, and the staff members at the\nlocal coffee shop \u2018see\u2019 me at any point in time in any given context and how I\n\u2018see\u2019 them is analogue. That none of them would confuse me for George Clooney\nis a digital conclusion to an analogue process, as are conclusions such as \u201cI\ndon\u2019t trust Alice to watch my kids\u201d and \u201cI am first and foremost a Londoner\u201d\nfor example.\n\nHow we each perceive and make sense of and interact in relationships in\nvarying contexts is analogue. Noun-like conceptualizations of identity are\ndigital by nature. Verb-like conceptualizations are analogue by nature.\n\nI feel the need here for analogy. I have employed a physics analogy\npreviously, specifically relating to structural rigidity (Sheldrake 2020b,\n2021a). This works for me as an engineer, but I\u2019ve been looking for something\nthat most everyone can see more clearly.\n\nI played 3D Monster Maze in 1981 courtesy of a 3.5MHz processor and 1 kilobyte\nof RAM. It\u2019s a digital representation that is never going to be confused for\nthe \u2018real\u2019 thing. These days, gaming with a Playstation or Xbox is a\nqualitatively different experience of course, but still not yet one that may\nbe confused for reality, so to speak. Could we get there? I have not seen a\ncompelling argument for why not, and digital reproduction of audio and video\nmay already be said to be indistinguishable from reality, again so to speak.\n\nIt takes a certain technological sophistication to have digital information\nperceived as analogue. In the far easier deterministic contexts, bitrate is a\nkey system property. In non-deterministic contexts, requisite variety is a\ncritical quantum.\n\nFigure 1: A screenshot of 3D Monster Maze courtesy of: https://www.zx-\ngaming.co.uk/games/monstermaze/default.htm\n\nSo now the analogy. The 3D Monster Maze screenshot (Figure 1) is to our eyes\nas contemporary digital identity is to human identity, to our sense-making\ncapacities. Analogously speaking, allowing noun-like digital identity to\nspread pervasively and encroach on domains in which we currently rely on verb-\nlike mechanisms, as it is in fact designed to do, renders our sense-making\n\u2018view\u2019 of the world with similarly miserable and monotone resolution as for\nthe Tyrannosaurus rex here. We all experience vision loss.\n\nContemporary digital identity (including associated processes) is incredibly\nunsophisticated. It is Newtonian in painful contrast to the manifesting of\nverb-like conceptualizations of identity, in contrast to the rich complexity\nof our multiple, interpenetrating, social minds. It lacks fidelity. It lacks\ncontext. It lacks variety. It lacks restraint.\n\nAs we are never required to opt into the SSI macro system, refusal, informed\nor otherwise, and it will mostly be otherwise, isn\u2019t a choice. Rather, we each\naccept its gradual transaction-by-transaction introduction for its efficiency,\nfor its convenience, encouraged by the privacy and agency enhancing claims\nmade for it. Loss of vision is imperceptible at this micro level for the vast\nmajority whose needs are perfectly accommodated by the code in that moment.\nThose for whom the loss proves problematic go unheard, or perhaps offered\nreassurance that this new system just needs time to bed in. Eventually\nhowever, inevitably, the majority will feel the ill effects as more contexts\nand applications are enveloped, in much the same way that it\u2019s not uncommon to\nsuffer a rare disease (\u201cFAQs About Rare Diseases\u201d 2021). The system will\nstumble on for years until widespread and compounding loss of resolution\ncauses such individual and social harm that a reversal out of this identity\nsystem becomes the only response, a reversal requiring legislation in the\nabsence of any other suitable governance of the decentralized technology. The\nlegislation will necessarily phase in over years given the level of pollution;\nthe code underpinning billions of quotidian activities must be revised.\n\nWith this analogy I\u2019m not saying that digitally mediated and augmented verb-\nlike identity needs to look or feel exactly like the non-digitalized thing. We\nare talking more about our sense-making capacities than just our senses, and\nit is quite possible that appropriate technology in this respect feels\ndifferent; it should feel comparatively amazing. I am saying that the\nsophistication of the systems we design to augment ourselves in this context,\nto extend ourselves, needs to correspond with and play to the astonishing\nqualities of mind. Whereas \u2018backwards compatibility\u2019 typically conveys\ninteroperability with an older, less capable system, in our context the\n\u2018legacy system\u2019 is of a massively more powerful design. Compatibility may be\npursued with attention to contexts, to variety, to restraint, to the\ninterdisciplinary analysis of existing cultural patterns, and to the accretive\ndevelopment of social norms. Ultimately, any sufficiently advanced technology\nwill be indistinguishable from Nature (Schroeder 2011).\n\n## I\u2019m off vertex!\n\nI know from experience that talking in terms of ecology and systems, in terms\nof complexity and requisite variety, isn\u2019t always a recipe for successful\ncommunication and knowledge building. It is necessary I believe, respectful in\nfact, but insufficient; hence my use of analogy. While it is always\nchallenging to paint a picture of emergent outcomes from individual events, by\ndefinition, I will attempt to describe the vista here from the bottom up to\nthrow more light on what I mean by loss of vision.\n\n\u201cVerifiable credentials (VCs) are the very heart of SSI architecture.\u201d\n(Chadwick & Burnett 2021) A credential makes one or more claims about its\nsubject. It is digital in the full sense discussed above, and the claim may\nstate anything. It could for example relate to an attribute (e.g. Alice is\nover 18), a relationship (e.g. Alice is Beth\u2019s mother), or entitlement (e.g.\nAlice is licensed to drive). Each credential is issued by a single party, e.g.\nthe driving licensing authority, and must be verifiable as the lexicon\nconveys. Historically, verifiable proof of being licensed to drive relies on a\nphysical document. VCs replace the tangible document with intangible,\ncryptographically-enabled and programmable verifiability.\n\nThe credential issuer, the credential holder, and the credential verifier may\nbe regarded as each sitting on a vertex of a triangle. This triangle is\nreferred to as a trust triangle because the verifier is said to be able to\ntrust the process to act digitally, i.e. confirm or deny the verifiability of\nthe credential (Chadwick & Burnett 2021; Reed et al. 2021). However, such\nlabelling is disingenuous. Trust is a social quality. Trust has no meaning in\ndeterministic situations (Cook 2001); you don\u2019t need to trust that 2+2 will\nstill equal 4 tomorrow, it just will. This cryptographically powered\ninformational triangle in fact circumvents any need for the verifier to trust\nthe holder.\n\nThe frequency with which people need to trust each other declines as SSI use\ngrows, which in turn changes the character of human relations, of community,\nof society. Today, we largely qualify each other contextually with a difficult\nto describe but deeply valuable fuzziness. Tomorrow, we, or more precisely our\ndigital agents, quantify and filter non-contextually with exacting precision,\nwith unforgiving recall, and with mindless programmatic dedication.\n\nImagine now that you wish to convey some credential to a verifying party. You\nwish to be a credential holder as might (but might not) be accommodated by the\nsystems of the would-be verifier and issuer. If your case is straightforward,\nthen SSI may serve you well in this micro instance. You have a driving\nlicense. You do not have a criminal record. This is your legal identity. You\ngot this grade in computer science. You are old enough to buy a beer. You own\nthis property. You no longer own that car. You are married. You earn this\nmuch. You attend this church. Your parents went to this college. You donated\nthis much to the party. You reported this many transgressions to the\nauthorities. You have this facial profile. You have this gene, and definitely\nnot that one.\n\nI have offered some examples there that clearly have ethical challenges in\nthemselves when SSI does indeed work as intended; self-interest and system-\ninterest are very much misaligned to the injury of both. Such uses can only\nreally be denied by voluntary ethical governance, especially as laws\nproscribing SSI for specific purposes are nearly impossible to police by\ntechnical design. Nevertheless, there are deeper challenges including those\nthat arise when the credentials and contexts you seek to present in the world\ndon\u2019t align with the way relevant verifiers and issuers have structured their\nsystems.\n\nI do have a criminal record but please allow me to explain. I nearly got all\nthe way to graduating with flying colours, but both my parents died in the\nfinal semester. I had a great reputation at my last job, it\u2019s just that my\nline manager and I fell out at the end for reasons I cannot talk about. My\nformer housemates rate me antisocial, but it\u2019s nothing more than introversion.\nYes, I struggle with punctuality, but please know that I\u2019m also a carer. In\nsummary, my life doesn\u2019t coincide neatly with the precise digital location of\n\u201ccredential holder\u201d in the system\u2019s so-called \u201ctrust triangles\u201d, and whether\nit does or does not, the \u201ctrust triangle\u201d doesn\u2019t trust me to offer context.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m off vertex!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m context denied!\u201d could turn out to be modern-day\ncries of anguish equivalent to \u201cI\u2019m not a number! I\u2019m a free man!\u201d (Cox 2017)\n\nIf you feel the need to tell the world you're off vertex or context denied,\ndownload the graphics to use as you wish. The designs are public domain. It\ncould be a fascinating conversation starter ... well, in the right contexts.\nThey come with no warranty as to identity effects.\n\nOff vertex context denied svg files\n\noff-vertex-context-denied-svg-files.zip\n\n10 KB\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the immediate transactional disadvantage here, but there is\nalso an immediate psychological harm. These contexts are self-narrative. They\nare identity. They are identity being denied by the system. This in turn has\nimmediate effects in society. Natural complex systems, not least human\nsociety, have never progressed by stepping neatly on the vertices of a set of\npredefined non-contextual triangular potentials.\n\nSSI has been described to me as \u201cthe most contextually-sensitive identity\ntechnology I know of\u201d in contrast to my assertion that SSI cannot communicate\ncontext (Sheldrake 2021c). You won\u2019t be surprised to learn that we\u2019re both\nright in our different contexts. The first context is the rather low bar of\nidentity technology, whereas mine is human society and nature, and what SSI\nsets out to do contextually is an utterly miserable substitute for\ncontextually-sensitive non-technologized human relations. This may well be a\ncriticism of the general datafication of human society, but SSI is positioned\nas a flag carrier, as a primary vector in this regard. The technology ignores\ncontexts by design. Based on good intentions, technologists are encouraged and\nobligated to some extent to follow the data minimisation design principle per\nFair Information Practices (Reidenberg 1999; Schwartz 2001), Privacy by Design\n(Bellotti & Sellen 1993; Langheinrich 2001), and associated regulations. Yet a\nsystem designed according to the data minimisation principle cannot take in\nany other information, and so cannot communicate context (the information\n\u2018around\u2019 the information), and so in turn may well frustrate any striving for\njustice for justice is necessarily contextual.\n\nIf such effects impacted a small minority all the time, legitimate objections\nmight be lodged today on exclusionary grounds, but it\u2019s worse than that; we\nwill all be off vertex and context denied on occasion. The fact that some will\nfind themselves more regularly in this situation doesn\u2019t become an issue so\nquickly because everyone else can say that we\u2019re all feeling the bumps in the\nSSI road. Given the reflexivity of social identity, one can easily imagine\nlifestyles being rated and described in discriminating language based on which\ntypes are impacted more or less than others. Nevertheless, even if your\nlifestyle is rated \u201cfully on vertex\u201d and your context type \u201cmodel citizen\u201d,\nyou and your communities are a duality. As your communities suffer, you\nsuffer.\n\n## Concluding\n\nDigital media was originally considered fertile territory for verb-like\nidentity. Digital connectivity offered \u201cnew possibilities for experimenting\nwith identity\u201d to the extent that one might refer to the Internet as \u201can\nidentity workshop.\u201d (Turkle 2011) By the close of the 1990s \u201c... there is no\nsimple sense in which computers are causing a shift in notions of identity. It\nis, rather, that today\u2019s life on the screen dramatizes and concretizes a range\nof cultural trends that encourage us to think of identity in terms of\nmultiplicity and flexibility. ... one can be many, and one usually is.\u201d\n(Turkle 1999)\n\nHere in the 2020s however, if the development and implementation of digital\nidentity follows its current trajectory, if we continue to consider \u2018the\ndigital\u2019 separate from cognition, from mind, from living processes, if we\ncontinue to pollute our way towards a degenerative internetome, there is now\nunfortunately a very simple sense in which computers are causing a shift in\nnotions of identity. Digitalized life is manifesting a noun-like\nconceptualization of identity at the cost of the operation of verb-like\nconceptualizations, and this is deeply concerning given that the latter\ndescribe the way the world works according to the considerable majority of\ndisciplines with an interest in the matter, whereas the former relates to how\ninformation technology has been wielded to address inanimate objects.\n\nDigitalized life increasingly ties us to identifiers artificially separated\nfrom any kind of contextual co-emergence and reciprocity with information\nexchange in relationships, severely curtailing personal freedoms, both\nphysical and psychological, and eroding long-serving social mechanisms.\nPersonal choice will be eroded by the lifeless assimilation through\ncryptographic triangulation or the rejection of all things digital, both\nwoefully inadequate at just the moment when large-scale generativity is\nrequired to rise up to global super-wicked problems together.\n\nGiven that the working of our minds underpins most everything we hold dear\nabout human life, the slow systemic substitution of digital identity in social\ncontexts that currently invoke verb-like identity mechanisms is nothing short\nof reckless and unethical. There is only some very small solace in the fact\nthat no-one can engineer this for others; they and their loved ones will be\ninflicted too. While discrimination (recognising distinction) is SSI\u2019s\nfunctional purpose, this trauma is non-discriminatory because we are all\nhuman.\n\nFather and son Marshall and Eric McLuhan formulated four media laws in the\nform of questions, claiming them to apply universally to all media (Harman\n2012; McLuhan & McLuhan 1988). The four questions offer an appropriate\nstructure for concluding here.\n\nQ1. What does the artefact enhance or intensify or make possible or\naccelerate?\n\nSSI amplifies the volume of credential issuance and presentation, an explosion\nthat could easily run up three or four magnitudes as associated frictions are\neliminated, as all parties are drawn to process efficiency, and as\nreputational information in particular is quantified, delocalized, and\ndecontextualized, disastrously. SSI accelerates the speed of issuance and\npresentation to be practically instantaneous, and weaves identifiers and\nclaims programmatically and deeply into systems at all scales and of all\ndegrees of (de)centralization. It makes secure (encrypted) messaging and data\nexchange pervasive, potentially to the detriment of social sense-making and so\nsocietal responsiveness.\n\nQ2. If some aspect of a situation is enlarged or enhanced, simultaneously the\nold condition or unenhanced situation is displaced thereby. What is pushed\naside or obsolesced ... ?\n\nSSI most obviously renders tangible credential documents and the corresponding\nface-to-face interactions redundant. It also reduces the frequency with which\nunverifiable claims are made and accepted on trust. On the contrary, absences\nof trustless verifiability may sow distrust with consequences for social\ncohesion. Decontextualization and cryptographic triangulation erodes self-\nnarratives and freedoms to perceive, think, and act contextually.\n\nQ3. What recurrence or retrieval of earlier actions and services is brought\nback and inheres in the new form?\n\nSSI retrieves the original goals of bureaucracy as Max Weber described in\n1920:\n\n> The fully developed bureaucratic apparatus compares with other organisations\n> exactly as does the machine with non-mechanical modes of production.\n> Precision, speed, knowledge of the files, continuity, discretion, unity,\n> strict subordination, reduction of friction and material and personal costs\n> \u2014 these are raised to the optimum point. (Weber 1978)\n\nBureaucracy is no longer celebrated of course. Weber himself came to condemn\nit, and in line with my focus on generativity, Bennis (1965) observes: \u201cIt is\nthe requirement of adaptability to the environment which leads to the\npredicted demise of bureaucracy ...\u201d. Nevertheless, SSI revitalises\nbureaucracy with a twist; decentralization. Kafka would be astounded and all\nthe more frustrated.\n\nQ4. When pushed to the limits of its potential ..., the new form will tend to\nreverse what had been its original characteristics. What is the reversal\npotential of the new form?\n\nNo-one wants to achieve the opposite effect to the one they set out to achieve\n(Sheldrake 2019b). If I was trying to be funny, SSI reverses into System\nSovereign Identity, aka Subsuming Structurated Identity. But it\u2019s not funny.\n\nComputer scientists can ignore most every other discipline and look only to\ntheir society-coding cousins, the law profession, for design inspiration. They\ncan ignore the fact that their code is potentially far more insidious than the\ncode of their lawyerly colleagues. They can ignore legal scholars questioning\nhistorical assumptions, observing how \u201csocial structures, institutions, and\npowerful contextual forces renders this simplistic model of autonomous\nindividualism almost mythical.\u201d (Haney 2002) But they can only do so by also\nignoring their profession\u2019s ethical standards.\n\nIn contemplating designing for its digital mediation and augmentation, we are\njust beginning to get real about the natural complexity of human identities\nimmanent in contextual relationships immanent in information exchange.\nCurrently, this involves the existing SSI community making some well-meaning\nattempts to identify specific problems and gaps and fix and fill them\nrespectively (e.g. the Trust Over IP Foundation). These efforts will fail for\nas long as the founding principles prevail, and as McLuhan noted, humanity\nwill begin to reflect the technology if computer science does not change\ncourse, as degenerative as that might be.\n\nIf we are to deliver in contexts rarely even mentioned in relation to digital\nidentity to date \u2014 psychological, sociological, and ecological health \u2014 a deep\ninterdisciplinary review is imperative as a new foundation for a\ntransdisciplinary design process.\n\nWe can respect human dignity. We can nurture human flourishing. I believe we\ncan develop the required sophistication together and go further still. In the\nprocesses of realising generative identity, the dominant structures of Web 2\nsocial media crumble; to a certain extent the conditions that might constitute\n\u2018decentralized social\u2019 fall into place. We can help establish freedom of mind,\nhuman connection, and the conditions to explore as yet untapped collective\nintelligences; both of individuals within social contexts and of groups\nthemselves.\n\n## References\n\nAkerlof, G.
