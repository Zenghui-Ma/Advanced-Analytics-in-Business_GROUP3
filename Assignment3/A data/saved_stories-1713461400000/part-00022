He can only be helped. But he must direct himself.\u201d\n\nAs a serious knowledge worker for a lifetime, I honed how I \u201cdirect myself\u201d\nover the years quite a bit. I have settled on a relatively flat and simple\nsystem to manage myself, linking my active project to-dos and my entire\nknowledge base\u2014comprising everything I\u2019ve accumulated from YouTube, podcasts,\netc.\n\n## Tooling \u00b6\n\nThe cornerstone of my personal knowledge management system is Obsidian. I\nswitched from Roam Research a few months ago and have grown to appreciate its\nsimplicity and robustness. It\u2019s primarily a tool for managing markdown files,\nbut it also allows linking to other files and shows backlinks within\ndocuments. I use it fairly \u201cvanilla\u201d to avoid complications with future\nchanges or if I want to switch tooling in the future, though I subscribe to\nthe syncing feature to use it across multiple devices.\n\n## Core Documents \u00b6\n\nAdopting an idea from Cal Newport, I rely on a set of core documents that I\nroutinely reference. These documents outline their purpose, my review\nfrequency, and update procedures, serving as my operating system.\n\n### Core Values \u00b6\n\nMy \u2018Core Values\u2019 document contains my life values, often including excerpts\nfrom books I\u2019ve read.\n\n### Strategic Plan \u00b6\n\nMy \u2018Strategic Plan\u2019 is crucial for quarterly assessing my current professional\nsituation. It includes a \u2018Triage\u2019 section for new thoughts to consider in the\nfollowing review that I maintain while life is happening.\n\n### This Week \u00b6\n\nThe \u2018This Week\u2019 document is operationally vital for me. I update it at the\nbeginning of the week and daily before I start work.\n\nI use this feel to organize my week in daily sections, sifting through various\nproject calendars to construct blocks that ensure I achieve one meaningful\ngoal each day while minimizing switching between different themes. For each\nday, I reference the specific project file I\u2019m working on together with\nplanned tasks and meetings.\n\nAlongside the daily sections, there is a \u201cThis Week\u201d Section for important\nstuff that I don\u2019t want to miss, but I don\u2019t know yet what day to tackle. This\nis an idea that was inspired by the Hey Calendar. Other than that, a \u201cnext\nweek\u201d section also helps me de-scope work from the current week for more\nfocus.\n\n### My Craft \u00b6\n\nThis document references other input documents, mainly from the web, with\nstuff I want to try when time permits.\n\n## Active Projects \u00b6\n\nI work on only 2-3 projects at any given time. In my case, this usually means\na larger consulting project and a startup that I am currently working on. Each\nproject has an index file with the following structure:\n\n  * Triage: This is where I initially dump everything that comes at me.\n  * Do this week: I regularly refocus on what I still need to do this week and what should be moved to next week.\n  * Not this week: Here, I shift tasks that I no longer want to tackle in the current week.\n  * Follow-Up: This is when I depend on someone else to do something I am responsible for.\n  * Later: This section contains things that I consider essential, but there are better times for them. I revisit these items during quarterly planning, etc.\n\nThe additional files in the project deal with various topics related to the\nproject, such as:\n\n  * Strategy\n  * Workshops\n  * Etc.\n\nAlmost every team member also has a file in the project folder. I make meeting\nnotes in these files and jot down items I need to discuss with them.\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that I only keep current, evergreen files in the\nproject folders. Once something is over (e.g., a workshop), I move it with the\nday\u2019s timestamp into the \u201cJournals\u201d folder to avoid clutter.\n\n## Processed Knowledge \u00b6\n\nThe files in those folders summarize things I\u2019ve read, listened to, or\nconsumed. The content comes from podcasts, YouTube, and web articles I\u2019ve read\nusing the Readwise Reader.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that I rarely use direct quotes or excerpts when\nprocessing knowledge; instead, I manually summarize the content. This ensures\nthat I have a collection of copied and pasted items and have taken an\nadditional step to understand what I\u2019ve read (spaced repetition).\n\nFor each of these knowledge nuggets, I reference specific other Obsidian files\nto retrieve the knowledge.\n\n(Usually, I do this in German, but for this example, I have translated it into\nEnglish)\n\n## Referenced Knowledge \u00b6\n\nMy referenced knowledge is organized into business, product, and tech\ncategories. In those folders, for example, within the product folder, I have\nfiles named \u201cVision,\u201d \u201cDiscovery,\u201d and \u201cUser Experience.\u201d For tech, this could\nbe \u201cWhat I Think philosophically About AI,\u201d \u201cHow I Conduct 1-on-1s,\u201d etc.\n\nSometimes, the files in these folders do not contain content. However, I use\nall the back-references that Obsidian offers when searching for the knowledge\nI have collected on a topic.\n\nThis can be very useful when I\u2019m writing a blog article about a topic or\ncoaching a direct report on how to conduct one-on-one meetings with their\nteam, etc.\n\nWhatever it is - I find everything that I know about this topic!\n\nOh, and then there is also this folder named \u201cMe,\u201d containing a lot of self-\nreflective stuff. I have thoughts on death, sleep, what I think when I\nexperience imposter syndrome, when I\u2019m too stressed, etc.\n\n## Notes \u00b6\n\nIn the \u2018Notes\u2019 section, I summarize things like journals, which helps me when\ndrafting emails. I keep them out of project folders but maintain necessary\nreferences.\n\n## Journals \u00b6\n\nI do not regularly journal, but sometimes, a journal-like format helps me. For\nexample, when I write an email, I first draft it in a note (translating and\nediting it as necessary), but I prefer to keep it from the project folder. The\nreferences from the journal to the project are sufficient.\n\n## Conclusion \u00b6\n\nThat concludes the overview of my knowledge management loops and practices.\nWith its two-way linking, Obsidian has been a fantastic tool in this regard.\n\nBut the most important part of the daily doing is the file structure with the\nTriage Section at the top of every file and explicitly de- and re-scoping\nstuff from the current week\n\n#### Meta\n\n  * Published On: 2024-04-15\n  * Found a typo?
