From the EDPB\u2019s draft ruling (PDF):\n\n> The offering of (only) a paid alternative to the service which includes\n> processing for behavioural advertising purposes should not be the default\n> way forward for controllers. When developing the alternative to the version\n> of the service with behavioural advertising, large online platforms should\n> consider providing data subjects with an \u2018equivalent alternative\u2019 that does\n> not entail the payment of a fee. If controllers choose to charge a fee for\n> access to the \u2018equivalent alternative\u2019, controllers should consider also\n> offering a further alternative, free of charge, without behavioural\n> advertising, e.g. with a form of advertising involving the processing of\n> less (or no) personal data. This is a particularly important factor in the\n> assessment of certain criteria for valid consent under the GDPR. In most\n> cases, whether a further alternative without behavioural advertising is\n> offered by the controller, free of charge, will have a substantial impact on\n> the assessment of the validity of consent, in particular with regard to the\n> detriment aspect.\n>\n> With respect to the requirements of the GDPR for valid consent, first of\n> all, consent needs to be \u2018freely given\u2019. In order to avoid detriment that\n> would exclude freely given consent, any fee imposed cannot be such as to\n> effectively inhibit data subjects from making a free choice. Furthemore,\n> detriment may arise where non-consenting data subjects do not pay a fee and\n> thus face exclusion from the service, especially in cases where the service\n> has a prominent role, or is decisive for participation in social life or\n> access to professional networks, even more so in the presence of lock-in or\n> network effects. As a result, detriment is likely to occur when large online\n> platforms use a \u2018consent or pay\u2019 model to obtain consent for the processing.\n\nSeufert again:\n\n> In its opinion on Meta\u2019s use of the Pay or Okay model, the EDPB effectively\n> says that any sufficiently valuable product must offer a free version that\n> doesn\u2019t monetize via behavioral ads. That the quality of being indispensable\n> means consumers must have unfettered access to it.\n\nWhat makes this all the more outrageous is that many major publishers in the\nEU use this exact same \u201cpay or OK\u201d model to achieve GDPR compliance \u2014 and none\noffer a free alternative with non-targeted ads. Don\u2019t hold your breath waiting\nfor Der Spiegel to offer free access without ads. Christ, they don\u2019t even let\nyou look at their homepage without paying or consenting to targeted ads. And\nSpotify quite literally brags about its ad targeting. But Spotify is an EU\ncompany, so of course it wasn\u2019t designated as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d by the protection\nracketeers running the European Commission.\n\nThey\u2019re not saying \u201cpay or OK\u201d is illegal. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s illegal only if\nyou\u2019re a big company from outside the EU with a very popular platform.\n\nMeta\u2019s only options for compliance with this ruling, as I see it:\n\n  * Offer a new free tier with contextual, rather than targeted, ads. To achieve an ARPU equivalent to Meta\u2019s paid and free-with-targeted-ads tiers, this new offering would likely have to inundate users with a veritable avalanche of annoying ads. This, I would wager, would be deemed \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d and thus also illegal.\n\n  * Offer a new free tier with contextual, rather than targeted, ads \u2014 but only show roughly the same frequency of ads as their lucrative free-with-targeted-ads tier. This is what the EDPB (and EC) are demanding, and seemingly think they can force Meta to do. Meta would almost certainly see ARPU plummet for all users who opt into this tier. Who knows if the revenue would even be sufficient to break even per such user?\n\n  * Invent some novel way to generate as much revenue per non-targeted ad as targeted ones. This is the \u201cnerd harder\u201d fantasy solution, a la demanding that secure end-to-end encryption provide back doors available only to \u201cthe good guys\u201d.\n\n  * Cease offering Facebook and Instagram in the EU. (WhatsApp doesn\u2019t monetize through targeted ads, so isn\u2019t germane to this ruling.) This is the option the EDPB and EC believe \u201cunthinkable\u201d for Meta to take, because the EU is, in their minds, an indispensable market.\n\nI don\u2019t see how Meta can risk the second choice. Meta could afford to see ARPU\nplummet solely within the EU, and at first thought, you might think some\nrevenue per EU user is surely better than no revenue at all from the EU. But\nif Meta caves and complies with this ruling by offering a free tier with\nsignificantly lower ARPU, that opens the door for regulators and legislative\nbodies around the globe to demand the same. Then, poof goes Meta as an\nindustry colossus.\n\nI suspect the EU regulatory bodies have some surprises coming regarding how\nthis is going to play out.\n\nPrevious:| From the Department of Spending Tim Cook\u2019s Money: Online Photo\nStorage Is Surely Expensive to Offer, but Apple Should Offer More  \n---|---  \n  \nDisplay Preferences\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002\u20132024 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
