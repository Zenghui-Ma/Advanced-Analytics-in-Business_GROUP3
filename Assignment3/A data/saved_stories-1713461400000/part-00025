But this didn't work.\n\nLucky me, there's a workaround.\n\nOpen the \"Inspector\" using \u2318 + i shortcut:\n\nThere you can select a note and once it's highlighted, it can be removed using\nthe backspace key:\n\nWhat are your thoughts about \"Can't delete a note in PDF using Preview on\nmacOS\"?\n\nDrop me a line - I'm looking forward to your feedback!\n\nImprint | Privacy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
