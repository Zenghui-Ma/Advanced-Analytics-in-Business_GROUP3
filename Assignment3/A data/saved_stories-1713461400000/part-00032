We chose not to create and\nreference a video because:\n\n  * it isn't desktop/mobile/tablet/... responsive\n  * adds a significant data payload and delay to the page\n  * would consume a lot of our time with each new iteration until it reached a final presentable state.\n  * adds bandwidth cost to our provider line\n\nInstead, I created a straightforward \"code play\" component that is easy to\nadapt, extend, and style. It can be seamlessly matched to any site's\nresponsiveness.\n\nI'm wondering if the IndieHacker community would be interested in a generator\nto create such visuals on the fly, complete with copy-paste code. If there's\nenough interest, I would create a basic github pages app and release all the\nsource code as open source, so anyone can contribute.\n\nCheers!\n\nRacingCarCareers\n\non April 18, 2024\n\nSay something nice to RacingCarCareers...\n\nPost Comment\n\nTrending on Indie Hackers\n\nAfter 10M+ Views, 13k+ Upvotes: The Reddit Strategy That Worked for Me! 42\ncomments Getting first 908 Paid Signups by Spending $353 ONLY. 24 comments\n\ud83d\udd25Roast my one-man design agency website 21 comments I talked to 8 SaaS\nfounders, these are the most common SaaS tools they use 19 comments What are\nyour cold outreach conversion rates?
