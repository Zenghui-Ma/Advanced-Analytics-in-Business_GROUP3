And just in time for sunglasses season, we\u2019re expanding the Ray-Ban Meta\nsmart glasses collection with new styles designed to fit more face shapes so\nyou can find the perfect pair. We\u2019re also adding new features, including\nupdates to Meta AI, to make the glasses even more useful.\n\n## A Frame for Every Face\n\nLooking for a vintage vibe? Our new Skyler frames feature a cat eye design\ninspired by an era of iconic jet-set style, designed to suit smaller faces.\n\nWe\u2019re also adding a new low bridge option for our Headliner frames. If your\nglasses tend to slide down your nose, sit too low on your face or press on\nyour cheeks, this is the fit for you.\n\nThere are hundreds of different custom frame and lens combinations on the Ray-\nBan Remix platform, so you can mix and match to make the glasses your own on\nray-ban.com. And our new styles are designed to be prescription lens\ncompatible. Skyler and the new Headliner low bridge fit are available for pre-\norder now on meta.com and ray-ban.com. These new styles are available in 15\ncountries, including the US, Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe.\n\nWe\u2019re also introducing the first limited-edition Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in\nan exclusive Scuderia Ferrari colorway for Miami 2024. Ray-Ban Meta for\nScuderia Limited Edition brings together the legacy of Ferrari, timeless Ray-\nBan design and cutting-edge tech from Meta, available April 24, 2024.\n\n## Share Your View on a Video Call\n\nFrom a breathtaking vista on a hike to experiencing your kid\u2019s first steps,\nthere are some moments in life that are just meant to be shared. That\u2019s why\nwe\u2019re adding the ability to share your view on a video call via WhatsApp and\nMessenger, completely hands-free.\n\nAt the grocery store and not sure which brand of kombucha to buy? Can\u2019t tell\nif that pineapple is ripe? Now you can hop on a video call with your mom and\nget her advice based on what you see. Video calling on Ray-Ban Meta smart\nglasses is rolling out gradually, so if you don\u2019t see the update right away,\nsit tight \u2014 it\u2019s on the way!\n\n## Meta AI Makes Your Smart Glasses Even Smarter\n\nFrom integrated audio to an ultra-wide 12 MP camera, Ray-Ban Meta smart\nglasses are jam-packed with tech. And in the US and Canada, you also get Meta\nAI \u2014 an intelligent assistant that helps you get things done, create and\nconnect with the people and things you care about. Just say, \u201cHey Meta,\u201d and\nask away! You can control the glasses using voice commands, and thanks to Meta\nAI, even get access to real-time information.\n\nWe started testing a multimodal AI update in December, so you can ask your\nglasses about what you\u2019re seeing, and they\u2019ll give you smart, helpful answers\nor suggestions. That means you can do more with your glasses because now they\ncan see what you see. Starting today, we\u2019re rolling this functionality out to\nall Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in the US and Canada in beta.\n\nSay you\u2019re traveling and trying to read a menu in French. Your smart glasses\ncan use their built-in camera and Meta AI to translate the text for you,\ngiving you the info you need without having to pull out your phone or stare at\na screen.\n\nCategories\n\n:\n\nMeta Product News Technology and Innovation\n\nTags:\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses\n\n## Related News\n\nMeta\n\n### Introducing the New Ray-Ban | Meta Smart Glasses\n\nIn partnership with EssilorLuxottica, we\u2019re launching a new generation of Ray-\nBan Meta smart glasses, available for pre-order now.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023October 3, 2023\n\n## Topics\n\n  * Company News\n  * Technology and Innovation\n  * Data and Privacy\n  * Safety and Expression\n  * Combating Misinformation\n  * Economic Opportunity\n  * Election Integrity\n  * Strengthening Communities\n  * Diversity and Inclusion\n\n## Featured News\n\n  * Meta\n\nIntroducing Our Open Mixed Reality Ecosystem April 22, 2024\n\n  * Meta\n\nMeet Your New Assistant: Meta AI, Built With Llama 3 April 18, 2024\n\nFacebook\n\n  * Virtual reality\n\n    * Shop Meta Quest\n    * Refurbished Meta Quest 2\n    * VR for Good\n    * Forums\n    * Referrals\n    * Blog\n    * Creators\n    * Download SDKs\n    * Developers\n    * Made for Meta partner program\n    * Meta Quest health & safety information\n    * Meta Quest safety center\n    * VR for work\n\n  * Video calling\n\n    * Shop Meta Portal\n    * Compare\n    * Features\n    * Private by design\n    * Meta Portal health & safety information\n\n  * Smart glasses\n\n    * Shop Ray-Ban Stories\n    * Privacy information\n    * Terms of service\n    * Data policy\n    * Supported countries\n\n  * About us\n\n    * About Meta\n    * Media gallery\n    * Brand resources\n    * For investors\n\n  * Our community\n\n    * Support SMB\n    * Giving together\n    * Social impact\n    * Business and community growth\n    * VR for Good\n\n  * Our actions\n\n    * Data and privacy\n    * Safety and expression\n    * Elections\n    * COVID-19 response\n    * Regulations\n\n  * Support\n\n    * Shop Help Center\n    * Order status\n    * Returns\n    * Find a product demo\n    * Legal\n    * Facebook Help Center\n    * Messenger Help Center\n    * Instagram Help Center\n    * WhatsApp Help Center\n    * Workplace Help Center\n    * Meta Quest\n    * Meta Verified\n\nFacebook\n\nFollow Us\n\nSkip footer menu\n\nSkip footer menu\n\n#### Virtual reality\n\n  * Shop Meta Quest\n  * Refurbished Meta Quest 2\n  * VR for Good\n  * Forums\n  * Referrals\n  * Blog\n  * Creators\n  * Download SDKs\n  * Developers\n  * Made for Meta partner program\n  * Meta Quest health & safety information\n  * Meta Quest safety center\n  * VR for work\n\n#### Smart glasses\n\n  * Shop Ray-Ban Stories\n  * Privacy information\n  * Terms of service\n  * Data policy\n  * Supported countries\n\n#### Support\n\n  * Shop Help Center\n  * Order status\n  * Returns\n  * Find a product demo\n  * Legal\n  * Facebook Help Center\n  * Messenger Help Center\n  * Instagram Help Center\n  * WhatsApp Help Center\n  * Workplace Help Center\n  * Meta Quest\n  * Meta Verified\n\n#### About us\n\n  * About Meta\n  * Media gallery\n  * Brand resources\n  * For investors\n\n#### Our community\n\n  * Support SMB\n  * Giving together\n  * Social impact\n  * Business and community growth\n  * VR for Good\n\n#### Our actions\n\n  * Data and privacy\n  * Safety and expression\n  * Elections\n  * COVID-19 response\n  * Regulations\n\n\u00a9 2024 Meta\n\nCommunity Standards\n\nData Policy\n\nTerms\n\nCookie policy\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer\nexperience, we use cookies.
