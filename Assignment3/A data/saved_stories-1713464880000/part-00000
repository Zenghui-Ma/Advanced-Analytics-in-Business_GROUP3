Last week, a\nsmalltooth sawfish that was rescued from Cudjoe Key was successfully moved to\na rehabilitation center by NOAA in partnership with FWC, MOTE Marine\nLaboratory, and Ripley\u2019s Aquarium.\n\nThe 11-foot male is the first sawfish that was rescued as part of this\nunprecedented collective effort. At last check, the sawfish is recovering at\none of MOTE\u2019s Sarasota facilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic that, you know, we\u2019re moving the needle in the\nright direction,\u201d said NOAA\u2019s Sawfish Recovery Expert Adam Brame. \u201cI do think\nthat there\u2019s going to be more that we have to respond to, you know, there\u2019s a\nlot of fish that are very sick, that, you know, we may not be able to save,\nand we understand that.\u201d\n\nWhile the officials and researchers work to understand what is happening to\nthe sawfish and other marine life, it is important to remember that the public\nplays an important role.\n\n\u201cOur hotline number is the best way they [the public] can contribute to our\nefforts because we\u2019re going to use those reports, to direct our rescue\nefforts, and so the more information they can provide in those reports, the\nbetter,\u201d explained Brame.\n\nTo report a sawfish sighting you can email Sawfish@MyFWC.com or call\n844-472-9347 (1-844-4SAWFISH). If you see any other type of fish in distress,\nyou can file a report on the FWC website.\n\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.\n\n##### About the Author\n\n##### Anastasia Pavlinskaya Brenman\n\nAnastasia Pavlinskaya Brenman is a 3-time Emmy Award winning producer and\nwriter for Local 10\u2019s environmental news segment \u201cDon\u2019t Trash Our Treasure\u201d.\n\nemail\n\n#### RELATED STORIES\n\n### Sawfish deaths rise by 6 in 7 days; first fish rescued in emergency effort\n\n### \u2018Heartbreaking\u2019: Tourists watch endangered sawfish die on crowded beach as\ndeath toll rises to 32\n\n### Detailed look at first rescue of endangered sawfish after dozens\nmysteriously die\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n1\n\n/\n\n5\n\nPompano Beach residents express concern over crime to Broward Sheriff Gregory\nTony\n\nRead More\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nDuration 0:06\n\n/\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nLoaded: 0.00%\n\n0:00\n\nRemaining Time -0:06\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.
