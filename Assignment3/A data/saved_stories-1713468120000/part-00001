Today's EDPB opinion\ndoes not alter that judgment and subscription for no ads complies with EU\nlaws.\"\n\nMeta is expected to continue engaging with the Irish Data Protection\nCommission, its lead regulator in the EU. The opinion is not anticipated to\nhave an impact on Meta's services.\n\nIn November last year, privacy activist group noyb (None Of Your Business)\nfiled a complaint with the Austrian data protection authority against Meta for\nintroducing the subscription model.\n\nAt the time, Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at noyb, said: \"EU law\nrequires that consent is the genuine free will of the user. Contrary to this\nlaw, Meta charges a 'privacy fee' of up to \u20ac250 per year if anyone dares to\nexercise their fundamental right to data protection.\"\n\nIn February, consumer groups filed their own complaint to stop Meta giving EU\nusers a \"fake choice\" between the subscription offer and consenting to being\nprofiled and tracked via data collection.\n\nComplaints filed by eight European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) members are\nbased on the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They argue that\nMeta's pay-or-consent model breaches data protection principles of the law,\nincluding the principles of purpose limitation, data minimization, fair\nprocessing, and transparency, with said processing enabling the company to\n\"infer private details about the consumer.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Meta\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Meta\n  * Social Media\n  * Whatsapp\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * GraphQL\n  * Max Schrems\n  * Open Compute Project\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Andrew McCollum\n  * Chris Hughes\n  * Dustin Moskovitz\n  * Eduardo Saverin\n  * Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Metaverse\n  * Social Network\n\n#### More about\n\n11 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Meta\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Meta\n  * Social Media\n  * Whatsapp\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * GraphQL\n  * Max Schrems\n  * Open Compute Project\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Andrew McCollum\n  * Chris Hughes\n  * Dustin Moskovitz\n  * Eduardo Saverin\n  * Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Metaverse\n  * Social Network\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Lawsuit claims Meta hobbled Facebook Watch to help Netflix\n\nAdvertiser antitrust lawsuit says claimed deal with Netflix is anticompetitive\n\nPersonal Tech16 days | 2\n\n#### Next-gen Meta AI chip serves up ads while sipping power\n\nFresh silicon won't curb Zuck's appetite for GPUs just yet\n\nOn-Prem8 days | 6\n\n#### Meta accused of snarfing people's Snapchat data via traffic decryption\n\nI ain't afraid of no ghosts, but in this case...\n\nPersonal Tech22 days | 20\n\n#### Reducing the cloud security overhead\n\nWhy creating a layered defensive strategy that includes security by design can\nhelp address cloud challenges\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Europe gives TikTok 24 hours to explain 'addictive and toxic' new app\n\nCommissioner Thierry Breton likens click-to-earn version to cigarettes\n\nSoftware8 hrs | 25\n\n#### Devaluing content created by AI is lazy and ignores history\n\nColumn The answer is not to hide from ML, but to be honest about it\n\nAI + ML1 day | 38\n\n#### No joke: FTC boss goes on the Daily Show and is told Apple tried to block\nher\n\nComment Land of the Free has lost its way in quest for profits\n\nOffbeat16 days | 76\n\n#### In-app browsers are still a privacy, security, and choice problem\n\nRegulators reminded that longstanding concerns haven't been addressed\n\nApplications22 days | 25\n\n#### Thank the bots, your blue check is back on X\n\nIf you're popular enough at Elon's party, that is\n\nPersonal Tech14 days | 37\n\n#### Judge demands social media sites prove they didn't help radicalize mass\nshooter\n\nSection 230 on trial: Plaintiffs contend social media platforms are defective\nproducts, not protected message boards\n\nPersonal Tech30 days | 95\n\n#### Meta connects Threads to the Fediverse\n\nDoing things outside the walled garden is kinda hard, devs admit\n\nPersonal Tech27 days | 18\n\n#### Hong Kong promises its latest national security law is not a ban on\nsocial media\n\nTrust us \u2013 we're the government\n\nPersonal Tech28 days | 9\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
