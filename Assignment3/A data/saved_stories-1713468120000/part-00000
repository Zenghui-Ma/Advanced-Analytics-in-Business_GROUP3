Now, the\ncity may outlaw them.\n\nKUT 90.5 | By Audrey McGlinchy\n\nPublished April 17, 2024 at 5:01 AM CDT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\nRenee Dominguez\n\n/\n\nKUT News\n\nJulia Mahavier, a senior at UT Austin, makes her bed in her West Campus\napartment. This is the second year Mahavier has rented a windowless bedroom.\n\nFor two decades, UT Austin professor Juan Mir\u00f3 has given his undergraduate\narchitecture students an assignment: Draw the window in your bedroom. The task\nfor a class called \u201cArchitectural Detailing and Materials,\u201d Mir\u00f3 says, is to\nget students thinking about the details of a room. The dimensions. The window.\nThe windowsill.\n\nWhen Mir\u00f3 gave this assignment in January 2022, several students raised their\nhands. They told him they couldn\u2019t complete it. They didn\u2019t have a bedroom\nwindow to draw.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What do you mean? That\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s illegal,\u2019\u201d Mir\u00f3 recalls.\n\nIt\u2019s not illegal. Not in Austin. Building codes adopted by the city do not\nrequire natural light in apartment bedrooms, and developers have been\ndesigning and constructing windowless bedrooms since at least 2002. The\nmajority of these rooms appear to be in student housing, tucked into buildings\nthroughout West Campus, the neighborhood immediately west of the university.\n\n\u201cWindows should be a human right,\u201d Mir\u00f3 says, arguing that the health benefits\nof natural light should outweigh the need for more student housing. \u201cA lot of\nstudents went through the pandemic in those windowless rooms. ... They were\ntelling me, \u2018It\u2019s horrible.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow after years of advocacy by students and professors, including Mir\u00f3,\nelected officials in Austin are set to prohibit bedrooms without windows in\nnew developments.\n\n### The beginning of windowless bedrooms\n\nThe path that led developers to windowless bedrooms begins with fire and ends\nwith light. In order to regulate health and safety in buildings, cities across\nthe country adopted the International Building Code which governs, in part,\nthe design of apartments.\n\nOne of the main concerns of the IBC guidelines is to protect people from dying\nin building fires. For a long time, developers had to build windows in\nbedrooms to ensure someone could use it as a point of exit; you could open\nyour window and escape a fire, for example. But once developers started\nbuilding sprinkler systems in tall buildings, they were no longer required to\ninclude windows as a means of exit.\n\nPatricia Lim\n\n/\n\nKUT News\n\nJuan Mir\u00f3, an architecture professor at UT Austin, advocated for the city to\nprohibit bedrooms without windows.\n\nWhich brings us to light. The building code requires that rooms where people\nsleep have some form of natural or artificial light. The word \u201cor\u201d provides an\nout. Developers don\u2019t always need to provide natural light. Municipalities can\ntweak these rules when they adopt the code, tailoring it to the needs of their\ncity \u2014 but Austin has left this section alone. Other cities, like New York and\nChicago, have their own laws or codes requiring windows and natural light in\nbedrooms.\n\nAt least two decades ago, developers working in Austin realized they weren\u2019t\nrequired to install windows in apartment bedrooms. If bedrooms don\u2019t require\nwindows, they don\u2019t need exterior walls. That meant developers could build\nmore bedrooms and build them more cheaply. KUT reached out to half a dozen\ndevelopers that have built windowless bedrooms in Austin, but did not hear\nback.\n\nIn West Campus, property managers charge per bedroom instead of per apartment.\nBuilding more bedrooms means more money. Suddenly, with so many windowless\nbedrooms, windows became an amenity; it\u2019s common in student housing for\nmanagement companies to charge more for a bedroom with a window.\n\nAudrey McGlinchy\n\n/\n\nKUT News\n\nIon Austin, an apartment building in West Campus, lists on its website various\n\"add-ons\" for which it charges monthly fees.\n\nIn the building where Julia Mahavier lives, students pay a $15 monthly fee to\nhave a window. But when the senior journalism major from San Antonio looked\ninto renting a room there, she was told no bedrooms with windows were\navailable. (Her room does include a narrow window that looks out on a\nhallway.)\n\n\u201cI did not know that windowless bedrooms were a thing [before coming to UT],\u201d\nMahavier said. \u201cIt never crossed my mind.\u201d\n\nMahavier first lived in a windowless bedroom her sophomore year. She found the\nlack of natural light depressing and vowed to not do it again. But this year\nMahavier, who qualifies for cheaper housing because she receives need-based\nfinancial aid, was told the only bedroom available to her was one without a\nwindow. She pays nearly $1,100 a month, plus fees, for the room.\n\nRenee Dominguez\n\n/\n\nKUT News\n\nMahavier's bedroom in West Campus does have a small window, but it looks out\nonto a hallway and provides little natural light.\n\nMahavier says she often feels disconnected from the outside world when she's\nin her room.\n\n\u201cLooking over at the clock I can tell what time it is but I can\u2019t see what\ntime it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the weather is. I don\u2019t know what it\nlooks like outside.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many bedrooms without windows there are in Austin. In 2022,\nMir\u00f3 employed a student to help him calculate this number, and they identified\nnearly 1,200 windowless bedrooms at six apartment buildings in West Campus.\nBut their list is far from complete. For one, it doesn\u2019t include Mahavier\u2019s\nbuilding. Mir\u00f3 estimates the true number of windowless bedrooms is closer to\n6,000.\n\nRenee Dominguez\n\n/\n\nKUT News\n\nVillas on Rio is one of the buildings that includes windowless bedrooms,\naccording to an analysis by Mir\u00f3 and a student.\n\n### The health impacts of windowless bedrooms\n\nIn 2021, the University of California at Santa Barbara announced it would be\nbuilding a new dorm designed by an ultra-wealthy donor. Nearly all the\nbedrooms would be windowless. Almost immediately, there was public outcry.\n\nAustin City Council Member Zo Qadri, whose district includes UT Austin,\nremembers hearing this story and recoiling at the idea of living in a\nwindowless bedroom. His younger sisters, he said, had lived in windowless\nbedrooms while students at UT Austin. One of them still does. Qadri says she\nsometimes asks to stay at his apartment.\n\n\u201cJust so she can have a place with a window,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it really does\naffect the mental being and mental stress of being a student.\u201d\n\nNumerous studies prove the benefits of living in a room with a window to the\noutside. Natural light helps people feel more alert and less depressed, and\nregulates circadian rhythm.\n\n\u201cMy body had no idea what time it was. I was always tired. I was very\nirritable,\u201d said Roosh Bhosale, a former UT Austin student who lived in a\nwindowless bedroom during the pandemic.\n\nBhosale attributes these depressive symptoms to being stuck inside his room\nfor hours a day. He decided to devote his senior year to studying the mental\nhealth impacts of windowless bedrooms on students. As he worked on his thesis,\nUC Santa Barbara announced it would not move forward with building the\nwindowless dorm.\n\nIn September, Qadri and his colleagues passed a resolution asking staff to\nlook at outlawing windowless bedrooms, with at least one major exception. The\nchange does not require that windows face the outdoors and lets developers use\nwhat's called \"borrowed light\". Borrowed light refers to natural light from\nanother room. Developers would be able to build a bedroom window that looks\nout onto a living room or hallway with natural light, therefore \"borrowing\"\nthat light from elsewhere.\n\nThis does not sit well with Bhosale.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018borrowed light\u2019 feels exploitative. Why can\u2019t we just have light?\nWhy can\u2019t we just have natural light in bedrooms?\u201d he said.\n\nRenee Dominguez\n\n/\n\nKUT News\n\nMahavier has started sleeping in her former roommate's bedroom, since it has a\nwindow.\n\nDuring her final weeks in college, Mahavier has found a way to access a\nbedroom window. A couple weeks ago, a roommate moved out. While normally a\nproperty manager would have locked the bedroom door, Mahavier says, no one\ndid. About a week ago, the journalism major grabbed her bedding and her alarm\nclock and moved into the room with a window.\n\nOn a sunny day last week, light poured into her adopted bedroom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice,\u201d Mahavier said, gesturing to the window from which she could\nsee fellow students walking to and from class. \u201cI love it so much.\u201d\n\nTags\n\nAustin HousingStudent HousingDevelopment CodeKUT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\nAudrey McGlinchy\n\nAudrey McGlinchy is KUT's housing reporter.
