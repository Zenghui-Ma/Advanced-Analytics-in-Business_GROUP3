Einstein's theory of\nrelativity, for example, suggests the universe is a static, four-dimensional\nblock that contains all of space and time simultaneously\u2014with no special\n\"now.\"\n\nWhat's the future to one observer, is the past to another. That means time\ndoesn't flow from past to future, as we experience it.\n\nThis clashes with how time is conceptualized in other areas of physics, such\nas quantum mechanics, however. So is time an illusion or not? One approach to\nfind out would be to try to prove that time is unreal using logic alone.\n\nIn 1908, J.M.E. McTaggart, an English philosopher, published a paper arguing\nthat we might be able to work out the unreality of time just using logical\nthinking alone.\n\nImagine that someone has given you a box of cards, each one representing an\nevent. One card describes the year 2024, another one the death of Queen\nVictoria, and another the solar eclipse in 2026. The cards have been mixed up.\nYou have been told to arrange these cards in a way that represents time. How\nwould you go about doing it?\n\nThe first way is to use what McTaggart calls the \"B-series\". You pick one card\nand place it on the floor. Then you take another one from the box and compare\nit with the one already on the floor. If it's earlier, you put it to the left\nof it. If later, you put it to the right.\n\nFor example, the death of Queen Victoria goes to the left of the 2026 solar\neclipse. The year 2024 goes to the left of the 2026 solar eclipse, but to the\nright of the death of Queen Victoria. You keep repeating this until you end up\nwith a line of cards, any two of which are related using the earlier-later\nrelation.\n\nAs you sit and look at the finished arrangement, you realize that something is\nmissing. The line of cards is static. Once the cards have been put in place,\nnothing about their order changes. But, as McTaggart insists, you cannot have\ntime without change.\n\nTime is ultimately a measure of change, even according to physics. It is often\nidentified as a rise in disorder\u2014entropy\u2014of a closed system. Take a cup of hot\ncoffee. As it cools down, entropy rises. And you can tell roughly how long a\ncup of coffee has been standing there by its temperature. Any device that\nmeasures time, such as a clock, relies on change (ticks).\n\nRemember, your original job was to arrange the cards in a way that represents\ntime. But you ended up with something that doesn't change. It would be odd to\nsay that time does not change. So the B-series cannot capture time.\n\nThere is, however, another option. You can start again and try to arrange the\ncards using what McTaggart calls the \"A-series\". You create three neat\npiles\u2014on the left go all the cards describing events that happened in the\npast, like the death of Queen Victoria. In the middle go those happening in\nthe present, like the year 2024. And on the right, those that will happen in\nthe future, like the 2026 solar eclipse.\n\nUnlike the B-series, this arrangement is not static. As time goes on, you have\nto move the cards from the right (future) pile into the middle (present) pile,\nand the ones from the (present) middle pile into the left (past) pile, where\nthey stay forever. So there is clearly change happening here. Does that mean\nthat the A-series describes time?\n\nAccording to McTaggart, the A-series is circular. Your hand moving the cards\nfrom the left-hand pile into the middle one and then into the right-hand pile\nis a process that already happens in time.\n\nYou need to be in time to be able to perform this arrangement. But time is\nexactly what you are trying to capture. In other words, you already need to\nhave time in order to describe time. This is circular, and circularity\nviolates logic.\n\nLet's sum up. The B-series arrangement cannot describe time, because nothing\nchanges about it. And change is required for time. So the B-series doesn't\nwork. The A-series does change, but unfortunately, it is circular. So it\ndoesn't work either. Since neither of these works, McTaggart concludes that\ntime cannot be real.\n\n## A hundred years later\n\nOver a hundred years later, philosophers are still searching for a solution.\nSome, called \"A-theorists\" try to define the A-series in a way that's not\ncircular.\n\nOthers, called \"B-theorists\", accept that the B-series describes reality and\nsay that McTaggart was wrong to require the series to change. Maybe all there\nis to time is just a line of events.\n\nThere are also \"C-theorists\" who go further and say that the line of cards\ndoes not even have a direction from earlier to later.\n\nThe year 2024 goes between the death of Queen Victoria and the 2026 solar\neclipse. But the fact that we're used to thinking of the death of Queen\nVictoria coming before the 2026 solar eclipse, rather than the other way\naround, is perhaps just a matter of habit. It's like numbering planks on a\nfence: you can start from whatever end you want. The fence itself has no\ndirection.\n\nI'm not yet convinced that any of them are right, perhaps there are different\nways of thinking about time altogether. Ultimately, time will tell.\n\nAnd regardless of who's right, what is remarkable is that McTaggart was able\nto get the argument going without any findings from science, but purely by\nthinking logically about the problem.\n\nProvided by The Conversation\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
