As they\nleft the building they were encouraged to board buses to other parts of\nFrance.\n\nThe early morning eviction by police in riot gear began just as France\ncelebrated the milestone of 100 days until the start of the Paris Games.\nCharities have said the state and authorities want to clear homeless people\nfrom the streets and squats to make Paris and its suburbs look better for the\nevent, which begins on 26 July.\n\nClutching their belongings, 300 people left the squat at Vitry-sur-Seine\ncalmly as about 250 police and gendarmes arrived. More than 100 others had\nleft before dawn. Buses waited outside, ready to take people to the central\ncity of Orl\u00e9ans or the south-western city of Bordeaux.\n\nMany of those who had lived in the squat said they did not want to leave the\nParis region because they had jobs there. \u201cI want to stay here,\u201d said Abakar,\n29, from Sudan. He was in Paris to do a logistics course and had been promised\na job in a supermarket.\n\nThe 450 people living at the squat included 50 women and 20 children. At least\n10 children attended local schools.\n\nThe squat had doubled in size after hundreds of asylum seekers, refugees and\nhomeless people were evicted last year from another squat in \u00cele-Saint-Denis,\nnear the Olympic Village site.\n\nPaul Alauzy ,of the humanitarian organisation M\u00e9decins du Monde, had been\ngiving health support at the Vitry-sur-Seine squat for three years. He is also\na spokesperson for Revers de la M\u00e9daille (The Medal\u2019s Other Side), a\ncollective of charities and aid workers who warn that the Olympics are having\nan impact on the most vulnerable homeless people in the Paris area.\n\nAlauzy said the collective denounced what they called \u201cthe effects of social\ncleansing for the Olympic Games\u201d. He said there had been a steady pace of\nclearing groups of homeless people or squats for the past year.\n\n\u201cIf there hadn\u2019t been the Olympic Games, the population of this squat would\nnot have doubled. The numbers grew because of the eviction of a squat near the\nOlympic Village,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo women wait with their belongings during the evacuation of the squat.\nPhotograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlauzy said the system put in place to bus people far from Paris and the\nsurrounding area was concerning.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to\neconomics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of people were waking up, brushing their teeth\nand packing their last things when the police arrived,\u201d he said.\n\nAlauzy said 80% of the people living at the squat, many from Sudan, Ethiopia\nand Eritrea, had refugee status or were asylum seekers and had legal\ndocumentation. Many had jobs, including on building sites and in carpentry.\nOne Sudanese man had shown his legal documentation, long-term work contract\nand payslips. \u201cBut he is a foreigner in France, and when you are Sudanese,\neven if you have all that paperwork, it\u2019s impossible to find housing \u2013\nlandlords won\u2019t accept you,\u201d Alauzy said.\n\nHe said many of the people did not have proper access to healthcare. \u201cThere is\nalso the question of psychological issues. People arrive at a squat and think\nthey will finally have a place to live. But in the Paris banlieue, in a\nbuilding with 450 people, in a collective squat with very little chance of\nintegrating in the country, after a traumatic journey here, mental health is a\nconcern.\u201d\n\nJhila Prentis, a volunteer at the squat, said: \u201cWe know the rate of evictions\nfrom buildings and camps [of tents] has accelerated over the past few months.\nThis building had no planning permission ... The building evicted in \u00cele-\nSaint-Denis is still empty ... We can only draw the conclusion that they are\ntrying to clear up the area for the arrival of tourists and international\nmedia for the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe situation of not having a place to sleep existed before the Olympics.\nIt\u2019s a crisis affecting a lot of European countries, including France. These\npeople were living in a squat, while over 50% had refugee status and many had\nwork. They should have appropriate housing.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Paris\n  * France\n  * Paris Olympic Games 2024\n  * Europe\n  * Homelessness\n  * Housing\n  * Social exclusion\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \u2018A message of peace\u2019: Olympic flame begins its journey to Paris\n\n2d ago\n\n  * ### Cambridge exhibition on 1924 Olympics throws spotlight on pioneering black athlete\n\n15h ago\n\n  * ### Paris Olympics opening ceremony could move if threat detected, says Macron\n\n3d ago\n\n  * ### Hardline French union files public sector strike notice covering Olympics\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Macron supports Aya Nakamura singing at Olympics after racist backlash\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### France assesses Paris Olympics terrorist threat in light of Moscow attack\n\n28 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Sport is never just sport\u2019: Olympics exhibition in Paris reflects 20th century\u2019s highs and lows\n\n28 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Two minors among nine arrested over French police station fireworks attack\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
