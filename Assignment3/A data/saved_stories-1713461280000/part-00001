We\noutline initial results and a protocol for future work from a programme of\nwork to: (1) establish a new method for data capture of adolescent-parent\ninteraction at home using wearable cameras and; (2) develop a new relevant and\ncomprehensive observational micro-coding scheme. In Part 1, we report our\ncompleted preliminary work, comprised of an initial scoping review, and public\nengagement work. In Part 2, we present a protocol for the development of the\nnew measure.\n\nMethods: Part 1\u2014We searched Pubmed for existing observational measures of\nadolescent-parent interaction for the scoping review. We also undertook public\nengagement work utilising a mobile research van, taken to multiple locations\naround Bristol, UK to engage with a variety of populations through interactive\nmethods. Part 2\u2014Our protocol describes plans for: (1) A systematic review of\nthe psychometric properties of observational measures of adolescent-parent\ninteraction; (2) Focussed public engagement workshops; (3) Harmonisation of\ninformation from existing coding schemes and literature with information from\npublic engagement with adolescents and parents; (4) A pilot study to assess\nthe acceptability and feasibility of the method; (5) Development of a coding\nscheme in consultation with expert and lay panels, and through real-life\napplication to recorded videos from a pilot sample.\n\nResults: Scoping review: we identified 21 adolescent-parent observational\nschemes, of which eight used micro-coding and 13 used globalcoding schemes.\nThe majority of micro-coding schemes were not developed specifically for\nadolescents. Most studies used conflict or problem-solving tasks, which may\nnot adequately capture positive adolescent-parent interactions. The mobile van\nevent received views from 234 young people and/or parents. Families were\npositive about taking part in research using headcams. \u201cTrust\u201d and\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d were most frequently reported as important adolescent-parent\nrelationship constructs.\n\nConclusions: This work represents the first attempt to truly co-design a\nmethod to assess parenting in adolescence. We hope to develop an observational\nmeasure using novel technological methods that can be used across a range of\nresearch and therapeutic settings.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAdolescence constitutes a crucial developmental period in which most mental\nhealth disorders typically arise (1). It also represents a period of\nrelational transition with growing sense of identity and autonomy or\nindependence from parents (2\u20134), which is accompanied by increases in\nadolescent-parent conflict (5) and decreases in closeness (6). Mental health\ndisorders are rising in young people at an alarming rate (7) and child and\nadolescent mental health services are unable to meet the level of demand for\ntreatment (8). Family interventions are recommended in the treatment of\nadolescent mental health disorders including conduct disorder, eating\ndisorders and depression (9\u201311). However, understanding of adolescent-parent\ninteraction is limited, particularly regarding micro processes underlying\nrelationships (12). Such processes are key to relational and behavioural\ninterventions and may be best understood from observing and analysing\nbehavioural interactions.\n\nThere is a large body of high-quality observational evidence from studies\nshowing that specific parenting constructs in early childhood promote later\ncognitive and socio-emotional development, and these findings have been\nsuccessfully translated into behavioural interventions which improve\nrelationships (13). However, such understanding is lacking in adolescence. In\naddition, in child, adolescent and adult romantic relationship interaction\nresearch there is a greater focus on negative and problematic interaction\npatterns (14, 15). Thus, there is a need for observational measures of\nadolescent-parent interaction that can assess relational strengths as well as\ndifficulties, with well-established ecological and content validity. The\nmeasures are needed to allow researchers to capture real life interactions and\nthen to make meaningful observations from them to aid better understanding of\nrelationships during adolescence. Secondly once established to provide tools\nto assess and evaluate relational change in clinical settings as well as to\nprovide feedback to families using the tools directly in interventions. It is\nkey to achieve this so that tools are accessible to families, researchers and\nprofessionals in educational, psychology or psychiatric settings. Such\nmeasures could have several applications: firstly, to inform the development\nof relational interventions for clinical populations with mental health\nproblems; secondly, to understand family processes in the general population;\nand thirdly, to better understand family relationships and how that links to\nmental health and other outcomes through use in large international\nprospective cohort studies. The present paper aims to set out a program of\nresearch to develop such a measure and is structured in two parts. In Part 1,\nwe report preliminary work we have already conducted, comprised of an initial\nscoping review and public engagement exercise. In Part 2, we report a protocol\nfor the next steps we will undertake to develop the measure. However, to begin\nwith, we present an overview of the field, highlighting some of the key\nmethodological limitations of prior research.\n\n### Overview of observational measures of adolescent-parent interaction\n\nFirstly, we review what observational work has been conducted with parents and\nadolescents to date. By \u201cobservational\u201d we mean methods where behaviour\nbetween parents and adolescents is observed and recorded to allow objective\nbehavioural analysis. One aspect of observational analysis concerns how the\ninteraction is elicited and captured (i.e., where and how it is recorded and\nwhat the family is doing) and the second aspect concerns how the behaviour and\nrelationship is then assessed or \u201ccoded\u201d from the observation. We explore both\nimprovements to methods of data capture and the coding of interactions here.\n\nWe begin by scoping existing measures. Researchers have utilised observational\nmeasures of adolescent-parent interaction since at least the 1980s (16), yet\nto our knowledge there has never been a systematic review focused on such\nmeasures. Twenty years ago, Aspland and Gardner (17) provided a helpful\nnarrative review of observer-rated measures of parent-child interactions,\nhighlighting issues including differences in task (structured vs.\nunstructured), setting (laboratory vs. home) as well as discussing issues of\nvalidity and reliability. However, this review did not aim to identify all\nexisting schemes, and only a few measures were discussed for purposes of\nillustration. Locke and Prinz (18) reviewed all measures they identified as\nassessing discipline and nurturance developed in the preceding two decades.\nOnly three observational measures were identified for the adolescent period,\nand six identified for early adolescence. The authors highlight the need for\nvalidation studies in different cultural groups, as well as the importance of\nresearch into the ethnicity of coders as a variable which may influence\ncoding. Jewell et al. (19) conducted a systematic review of attachment\nmeasures in middle childhood and adolescence, but only identified one scheme\nassessing observed adolescent-parent interaction, the goal-corrected\npartnership adolescent coding system (GPACS) (20), with all other observer-\nrated schemes assessing the child on their own, typically using attachment\ninterviews.\n\nMarshall et al. (21) recently conducted a systematic review of measures of\nadolescent-parent conflict processes and their measurement, identifying 568\nmeasures from 467 articles, of which 54 measures utilised observer ratings.\nThe approach to inclusion was generous, with many included studies providing\nscant details of the observer-rated task or measure [Marshall (2023) personal\ncommunication]. Moreover, the aim of this review was to analyse the ways in\nwhich adolescent-parent conflict has been conceptualised and measured (e.g.,\nfrequency of disagreement, duration of conflict), and the psychometric\nproperties of measures were not assessed. Finally, there have been two\nsystematic reviews conducted on the psychometric properties of observer-rated\nparent-child interaction measures for children: Ca\u00f1as, Ibabe & De Pa\u00fal (22)\nassessed measures for 0\u201312-year-olds at risk of child abuse and neglect,\nwhilst Gridley et al. (23) investigated measures for 0\u20135-olds used in\nrandomized controlled trials. Both reviews highlighted a lack of strong\nvalidity evidence for such measures.\n\nIn summary, it is known that observational-measures of adolescent-parent\ninteraction have been utilised frequently in research, yet the literature has\nnot been reviewed, and thus the full scope of the field, as well as the\npsychometric properties of measures, are currently unknown. Furthermore, the\nextent to which previous observed measures have conducted in depth micro-\nanalysis (where all behaviours and sequences between behaviours are explored)\nremains unclear because few previous studies include micro-coding systems\nacross all behavioural domains.More in depth micro-coding is important given\nthe potential for such micro codes to guide the development of more specific\nand person-centred interventions.\n\n### Limitations of existing observational measures\n\nWhilst there are advantages to observational measures, there are challenges\ntoo, with perhaps the most widely acknowledged difficulty being the length of\ntime needed to capture and then code recorded or live interactions. Less\ncommonly discussed are several important threats to the validity of such\nmeasures both in terms of data capture and coding of content: firstly, a lack\nof ecological validity due to lab-based observation; secondly, insufficient\ncontent validity evidence due to non-involvement of parents and adolescents in\nthe development of measures; and thirdly, a lack of evidence of content\nvalidity and measurement invariance across different cultures and changing\ntimes.\n\n### Ecological validity and methods of observation (data capture)\n\n#### Home or Lab settings\n\nIn terms of ecological validity, existing observational measures of\nadolescent-parent interaction typically involve visits to a laboratory to take\npart in a structured task, such as a conflict discussion [e.g., Allen et al.\n(24)]. Evidence suggests that behaviour under \u201claboratory conditions\u201d does not\nreflect behaviour at home (25, 26).\n\nLab assessments and researcher-administered home assessments may lead to\nreactivity effects, whereby people change their behaviour due to the presence\nof the researcher or knowledge that they are being recorded. There is limited\nevidence examining this: Gardner (25) reviewed the literature based on audio-\nrecorded assessments, which suggested no evidence of reactivity effects, but\nthis did not compare researcher-present to researcher-absent conditions. When\nassessments from lab and home observations are compared, lower levels of\nnegative behaviours are shown in the lab (15) which may reflect reactivity\neffects in the lab setting.\n\nIn addition, even though home settings improve ecological validity as compared\nto lab settings, in most situations a researcher is still present and has\nvisited at a scheduled time. We have previously provided evidence for improved\necological validity of observational assessment conducted using wearable\ncameras with families of infants. Lee et al. (26) found that when families\nwith infants self-recorded interactions with wearable cameras alone, as\ncompared to the same dyads interacting at home but recorded by a researcher,\nmore \u201cnegative\u201d and socially undesirable maternal behaviours were observed.\nFootage recorded from wearable cameras also has a major advantage in that it\ncaptures a \u201cfirst-person\u201d perspective on an interaction, in contrast to the\n\u201cthird-person\u201d perspective recorded from a static camera positioned to film an\ninteraction from a side-view. Firstly, the first-person perspective allows for\nsuperior capture of faces and eye gaze; secondly, there is the potential for\nthe development of therapeutic uses for such footage, such as video feedback\ntechniques in which a therapist reviews footage with a parent or adolescent,\nallowing them to see themselves \u201cthrough the eyes\u201d of the other person. Figure\n1 provides a photograph of the wearable cameras.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. An example of the two teens wearing head-cameras completing an\ninteraction task.\n\n#### Tasks to elicit interactions\n\nAnother key to ecological validity is not only where the interaction is\nrecorded but how the interaction is evoked. Very early work observing parent-\nchild interaction was conducted at home involving multiple visits from\nresearchers who observed and coded naturally occurring family behaviour \u201clive\u201d\n(27). The time-consuming nature of this led to the use of \u201cstructured\u201d tasks\ndesigned to elicit behaviours of interest. Dishion and Stormshak (14)\nconceptualise these tasks as assessing either relationship quality or\nbehavioural management. Relationship quality tasks in infancy and childhood\nare free-play or separation and reunion tasks. From childhood to adolescence,\nplanning discussion tasks (such as planning a fun family activity) are\ntypically used to assess relationship quality. In childhood, \u201cclean-up\u201d tasks\nare used to assess behavioural management and in later childhood and\nadolescence problem solving or conflict discussion tasks are used. The vast\nmajority of adolescent studies use problem solving or conflict discussion, and\nthese tasks have been shown to elicit relevant negative interaction behaviours\nwhen they use real rather than hypothetical scenarios (14). There is\nconflicting evidence on whether these behaviours elicited in the lab\ngeneralise to behaviours observed in unstructured settings at home. Behaviours\nobserved in home settings are more strongly linked to ratings of\npsychopathology than behaviours observed in a lab, with the strongest\nassociations found for unstructured tasks in the home (25). Behavioural coding\nacross structured and unstructured tasks within the same dyads also show only\nmodest agreement.\n\nAlthough the traditional view of adolescence as a time of high conflict with\nparents is not supported by evidence, there is an increase in more minor\nconflicts in early and middle adolescence (5, 6), meaning that conflict\ndiscussions are a relevant context for assessing adolescent-parent\ninteraction. These discussions allow observation of negative conflict\nprocesses such as criticism, hostility and coercion, and also more positive\nbehaviours such as validation, support, and listening which may reflect\nadaptive conflict resolution strategies (28). However, conflict discussions\nare less likely to evoke other positive behaviours such as affection or shared\nenjoyment (14, 15). In addition, given that engaging in a conflict discussion\ngenerates negative emotion and increased physiological arousal (29\u201331) this\ncontext may not be best suited to assess positive adolescent-parent\ninteraction quality. Tasks which may evoke more positive interaction qualities\nare needed. Such tasks may also be more acceptable and ethical in the context\nof parents and adolescents completing and recording tasks at home without the\npresence of a researcher.\n\n### Threats to the validity of existing measures that code or assess\nobservations\n\nContent validity refers to the extent that the content of an instrument\nadequately reflects the construct to be measured (32). For adolescent-parent\ninteraction measures, the perspectives of parents and adolescents on content\nvalidity are strikingly absent in the development of measures. Instead,\nmeasures appear to have typically been developed in a \u201ctop-down\u201d fashion by\nresearchers based on theoretical constructs such as attachment [e.g., Obsuth\net al. (20)] or coercive family cycles (33, 34). The lack of involvement of\nparents and adolescents hampers not only the content validity of measures, but\nalso represents a missed opportunity to gain valuable suggestions on the\nacceptability and feasibility of tasks. Involving parents and adolescents\nthrough co-design of a measure through participatory methods would help to\nstrengthen the content validity of a measure, in terms of both the task and\nthe scope of the construct/s to be measured. Such work can be combined in\niterative fashion during the substantive phase of validation (35) and feed\ninto other key early tasks such as mapping concepts and reviewing literature.\n\nMoreover, insufficient attention has been paid to the role of culture in\ndeveloping measures, both across and within countries. For instance, content\nvalidity cannot be assumed for minoritized groups within a culture, such as\nethnic minorities. Adolescent-parent relationships will be strongly influenced\nby cultural context, thereby complicating attempts to define norms for\nconcepts such as communication. This points to the need for careful validation\nwork, which can include consultation with stakeholders, qualitative\ninterviews, as well as formal studies of measurement invariance, when seeking\nto validate a measure for a specific population. In addition, the culture of\nresearchers may influence their coding: for instance, Yasui and Dishion (36)\nfound inter-rater reliability to vary as a function of the ethnicity of\ncoders, as well as of the concordance between the ethnicity of the coders and\nthe families being rated.\n\nFinally, we must consider the neglected concept of time in relation to content\nvalidity. Many measures of adolescent-parent interaction were developed\nseveral decades ago. Notwithstanding the absence of parent/adolescent\ninvolvement in their development, we can ask: do such measures retain their\nvalidity across time, or does validity evidence require continual renewal?\nBefore answering this question, it is worth going back to first principles and\nconsidering the meaning of validity, which refers to the degree to which\nevidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for proposed\nuses of tests (37). Thus, validity is not a property of a measure; rather,\nstatements about validity should be made with regard to specific uses of a\nmeasure (37). Researchers are likely to be familiar with the notions of cross-\ncultural validity and measurement invariance\u2014put simply, the need to evaluate\nthe performance of a measure in a new context, such as a translated measure\nused in a new country. Returning to the question of validity across time, we\nsuggest that adolescent-parent relationships have changed so much in Western\nsocieties that they represent a new cultural context when compared to families\nof several decades ago. Consequently, whilst the validity evidence for all\nmeasures has the potential to degrade over time, we suggest that measures\naiming to assess interactions between family members are particularly\nvulnerable to this due to the significant changes that have impacted\nadolescent-parent interaction in developed countries. Such changes include: a\ntrend towards older age for completing transitions out of adolescence such as\nfamily formation or ending education (38); the arrival of new technology and\nsocial media, giving rise to \u201cdigital parenting\u201d (39); and broader societal\nchanges in parent-child relationships such as increased communication and\nquality-time, reduced authoritarian control and corporal punishment, and\ndecreased parental self-efficacy (40). In summary, construct validation is an\nongoing process (41) which requires evidence to justify specific uses (37);\nviewed in this light, existing observational measures of adolescent-parent\ninteraction are far-from convincing in terms of content and construct\nvalidity.\n\n### Micro and global approaches to coding of observational content\n\nMost observational coding schemes of parent-child interaction assess \u201cglobal\u201d\nconstructs. Global ratings require the observer to form overall impressions\nfrom multiple different units of behaviour and consider frequency, intensity\nand duration within an entire interaction to make a numerical rating on a\nsingle scale. For example, in the global rating of maternal sensitivity, the\nmost well-known construct in infancy, a researcher makes a numerical rating\nbased on their global impression of how well the mother identifies, interprets\nand appropriately responds to her child's cues (42). This requires specific\nand time-consuming training to be able to assess reliably with baselines which\nwere often developed several decades ago. Micro-coding, in contrast, focuses\non individual units of behaviour and allows examination of moment-to-moment\ntemporal sequences of behaviour (43, 44). This approach considers more subtle\ninteractional processes and allows the identification of specific behaviours\nwhich may precede desirable or less desirable \u201ctarget behaviours\u201d, thus\nproviding unique (and flexible) information which may be readily translated\ninto intervention to promote positive parent-child interactions (44). Micro-\ncoding allows tracking of frequency, sequence and duration of interactive\nbehaviour (see Figure 2). Some micro-coding approaches focus on individual\nunits of behaviour such as facial expression [e.g., the Facial Action Coding\nSystem; FACS; (45)]. Individual units of behaviour permit automated coding,\nwhich considerably reduce the time and costs associated with observational\ndata. Most micro-coding approaches outside of infancy reflect behavioural\ngroupings which integrate across multiple different behaviours (e.g., facial\nexpression, bodily movements, speech) and require consideration of the\ncontext. In the SPAFF (Specific Affect Coding System), Coan and Gottman (46)\nrefer to these codes as \u201cgestalt behaviour codes\u201d and conceptualise them as\nunobservable latent variables which are directly observed via specific\nbehavioural indicators. For example, \u201cvalidation\u201d is observed with the\nindicators of agreement/apology, summarising, and head nodding with eye\ncontact.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2. Example of micro coded data on the behavioural domain of facial\nexpressions. The number and duration of each behaviour is visualised by the\ncolour blocks in Observer XT.\n\nPearson and colleagues (47) developed a comprehensive micro-coding scheme for\nparent-infant interaction including both discrete and gestalt behaviours from\na review of all existing coding schemes and have shown that reliability can be\neasily achieved (47, 48). The scheme is applied using the Observer XT [version\n16 (49)] software which permits coding of observational data on a timeline.\nFigure 2 shows an example of micro coded data on the behavioural domain of\nfacial expressions. The number and duration of each behaviour is visualised by\nthe colour blocks using Observer XT software.\n\n#### Limitations of existing micro-coding and considerations for adolescence\n\nMicro-coding also has limitations and particular considerations regarding its\nsuitability for adolescent behaviour. Most notably, in micro-coding in infancy\nthe context of each specific behaviour is not usually captured. For example,\nconsider a negative or sad face by a mother. The context of this facial\nexpression could lead to very different meanings and thus targets for\ninteractions. For example, it may reflect a negative emotional state in the\nmother and lack of warmth or may reflect emotional mirroring by the mother\n(which is likely to be highly sensitive). This can be lost in micro-coding\neven if combinations or sequences are used.\n\nIn infancy micro-coding schemes, one facial expression category that is highly\npredictive is a \u201cwoe\u201d face. As first described by Beatrice Beebe (50), this is\nan exaggerated sad face that is specifically linked to compassion/sympathy. It\ndoes not necessarily mirror a sad face in the child but instead marks an\nunderstanding by the caregiver which signals sympathy rather than negativity.\nGiven adolescents\u2019 vastly more sophisticated social and cognitive development\nrelative to infants, the ability of micro-codes to capture contextual\nsubtleties such as humour or sarcasm may be a particular challenge for coding\nschemes of adolescent-parent interaction.\n\n### Summary and aims\n\nThere is a need for methods to collect observational data which are\nacceptable, feasible and ecologically valid, and coding schemes which\nadequately characterise modern adolescent-parent relationships, with strong\ncontent and construct validity. Such methods can advance our understanding of\nparenting in adolescence and have the potential to inform the development of\nnew interventions, based on observed interactions. This could include\ntherapies that directly utilise observational material within the course of\ntreatment, such as video feedback, or the adaptation of existing approaches,\nsuch as parenting groups or family therapy, utilising evidence gleaned through\nobservational research. New methods are required due to the limitations of\navailable measures, including substantial threats to content and construct\nvalidity.\n\nThe programme of work described here aims to develop a new observational\nmeasure of adolescent-parent interaction by: (1) conducting a scoping review\nof the literature to identify existing adolescent-parent observational coding\nschemes and extracting all interaction codes; (2) conducting public engagement\nwork with relevant stakeholders (adolescents, parents and professionals) to\nidentify currently relevant constructs; (3) harmonising the \u201ctop-down\u201d\ninformation from the existing literature with the \u201cbottom-up\u201d information from\nrelevant stakeholders to generate a micro-coding scheme for adolescent-parent\ninteractions and suitable scenarios or tasks to record behaviour; (4) carrying\nout a feasibility study of the wearable camera methodology and initial\nvalidation of the coding-scheme in a pilot study of adolescents and parents.\nWe believe this is the first attempt to generate a tool to measure adolescent-\nparent interaction which combines both the traditional \u201ctop down\u201d approaches\ntaken in research and clinical practice with \u201cbottom up\u201d information from\nadolescents and parents.\n\n### Overall project aims\n\n1) Identify existing concepts important in adolescent-parent interactions from\nboth Public Patient Involvement (PPI) and existing literature.\n\n2) Develop an observational system to capture adolescent-parent interaction\nbehaviour based on the existing literature and co-creation methods.\n\n3) Explore feasibility and acceptability of wearable cams with adolescents and\ntheir parents at home.\n\n4) Develop a protocol (including tasks) which (a) can be conducted at home (b)\nallows capture of relevant footage and (c) evokes / captures relevant and\nauthentic domains of the relationship.\n\nInitial completed work presented in this paper:\n\n1) Scoping review of existing adolescent-parent observational measures (links\nto aim 1 and 2)\n\n2) Scoping public engagement with adolescents and parents of methods and\nconcepts (links to aim 2)\n\nNext steps to be described as protocols in this paper:\n\n1) Systematic review of measurement properties of existing coding schemes\n(links to aims 1 and 2).\n\n2) Construct definition through focused public engagement workshops (links to\naims 1, 2 and 4).\n\n3) Harmonisation of information from existing coding schemes with information\nfrom public engagement with adolescents and parents (links to aims 1, 2 and\n4).\n\n4) Assess acceptability and feasibility of data capture by wearable camera\ntechnology (links to aims 3 and 4).\n\n5) Development of a coding scheme in consultation with an expert panel and\nlay/PPI panel and through real-life application to recorded videos from a\npilot sample (links to all aims).\n\nTable 1 links the aims and objectives of the project to each piece of work\noutlined below, and summarises the output and current status of each.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Aims, objectives and linked activities for the project.\n\n## Part 1\u2014Completed ground work\n\n### Methods\n\n#### Scoping review to identify existing coding schemes, relevant behaviours,\nand indices of relationships\n\nTo identify papers with observed adolescent-parent interaction data we\nconducted a search in Pubmed using the terms \u201cparent adolescent observed\ninteraction coding behaviour\u201d (and all related synonyms, see Supplementary\nfile S1 for full search terms). Abstracts were screened to identify papers\nwhich included observation of parent-child interaction with samples with a\nmean child age of between 10 and 19 years. The methods sections of relevant\npapers were then checked to identify coding schemes to be included. Coding\nschemes were not included if they focussed on a very specific scenario (e.g.,\ndiscussions about cigarette smoking; parent-child interaction within a therapy\nsession) or included codes only on whole-family interaction.\n\n#### Public engagement/co-creation\n\nScoping public engagement: we conducted a PPI mobile research van event in\nmultiple locations around Bristol, UK, in August 2022 (51) with the aim of\nengaging with a variety of populations including those typically considered\n\u201chard to reach\u201d. Researchers spoke to young people and their parents to find\nout their views on what they considered to be the characteristics of a \u201cgood\u201d\nadolescent-parent relationship and key concepts were recorded using\nwhiteboards. Parents and young people were invited to try out the wearable\ncameras and give their views on taking part in research using them. They were\nalso asked what tasks or everyday scenarios would be acceptable and would best\ncapture their relationship interactions at home. Initial conversations were\nused to create a voting system where subsequent families voted on their chosen\ntask.\n\n### Results\n\n#### Scoping review of coding schemes\n\nThe search terms identified 128 papers. Of those, 44 papers included\nadolescent-parent interaction observational coding, reflecting 9 micro- and 13\nglobal- coding schemes. An additional 4 micro- and 2 global- schemes were\nidentified from the reference lists of the Marshall et al. (21), Locke &\nPrinze (18) and Jewell et al. (19) reviews and from reviewing reference lists\nof relevant papers. One global scheme was added from a preliminary search ran\nfor the systematic review of measures (described below). Given our focus on\nmicro-coding and space constraints, we will provide a more detailed account of\nmicro-coding schemes in this paper. These initial summaries for this paper\nfocus on the characteristics of the schemes rather than a description or\nsynthesis of the specific concepts assessed in the codes.\n\n##### Summary of micro-coding schemes\n\nTable 2 displays the identified micro-coding schemes. Columns summarise\ncharacteristics including: whether they were developed for adolescents; their\nhistory; what tasks they were developed for; and the type of codes contained.\nMicro-coding can be \u201cevent\u201d or \u201ctiming\u201d based. In event-based coding, once a\nbehaviour is coded, for example when a parent smiles, they will be coded as\nsmiling until that changes; that is, codes are updated according to new\n\u201cevents\u201d. In time-based coding, the behaviour is assessed within specific time\nwindows. For example, in a time-based coding scheme using two second\nintervals, at two seconds a parent could be coded as smiling; at four seconds,\nif the parent is still smiling, then they will again be coded as such. We use\nthe term \u201cbehaviour groups\u201d to describe codes that involve combinations of\nindividual units of behaviour. For example, \u201cfear\u201d in the Specific Affect\nCoding System [SPAFF (46)] is a combination of a range of different verbal\ncharacteristics (e.g., shifts in frequency in speech, speech disturbances),\nbody movements (e.g., gestures or fidgeting) and facial movements (e.g.,\ngulping and biting lip).\n\nTable 2\n\nTable 2. Summary of the characteristics of the identified adolescent-parent\nmicro-coding schemes.\n\nScheme history: Most of the identified schemes were either directly developed\nwithin or were influenced by work in the Oregon Social Learning Centre (OSLC),\nusing social learning theory (SLT) principles, particularly Patterson's cycle\nof coercion (34). As described in the table, the initial Family Interaction\nCoding System [FICS (27)], which has not been used with adolescents so not\nincluded in the review, has been developed and extended into several other\nschemes which were identified (Family Process Code (FPC), RACS, Peer Process\nCode (PPC) (52, 68, 72)). This work is largely based on clinical samples of\nchildren and families with behavioural problems, but also some studies with\ngeneral population samples with further developments of the scales. Schemes\nidentified in this review were also influenced by schemes developed using\nsocial learning theory principles to assess conflict resolution in adult\nmarital relationships such as the Marital Interaction Coding System [MICS\n(61)] and the Couples Interaction Scoring System [CISS (59)]. The Living in\nFamilial Environments (LIFE), Codebook for Marital and Family Interaction\n(COMFI), Parent-Adolescent Interaction Coding System-Revised (PAICS-R) (44,\n63, 70) all identified as being developed from these marital relationship\nschemes. The PAICS-R also draws on family systems theory. The LIFE scheme\nincluded consideration of the SLT processes involved in maintaining depression\n(reciprocity). Another scheme developed for children, INTERACT (57), draws on\nboth coercion and reciprocity models from social learning theory. Another\nschool of schemes which focus more narrowly on affect were developed from\nEkman's work on coding facial expression [SPAFF & Simple Affect Coding System\n(SACS)] (58, 62). One identified scheme specifically focused on conversational\ndiscourse in relation to language learning (Contingency Coding System; CCS)\n(72). Finally, one scheme drew on psychoanalytic theory on adolescent ego\ndevelopment (Constraining & Enabling Coding System; CECS) (16).\n\nCode types: Most schemes were designed to use event-based coding; the INTERACT\nand SPAFF are timing based; and the Relationship Process Code [RPC (55)] was\ndescribed as suitable for both event and timing-based coding. All the\nidentified schemes described \u201cbehaviour group\u201d codes, and none focussed on\ncoding individual units of behaviour (such as just facial expression or visual\nattention). Schemes from the OSLC tend to separate verbal from non-verbal in\ntheir behavioural codes, whereas other schemes combine the two modalities\n(e.g., the SPAFF) and some focus only on speech (PAICS-R, CCS). For example,\n\u201cvalidation\u201d is assessed as affect (non-verbal behaviour) in the RACS, but\nfrom speech and non-verbal combined in the SPAFF, or just speech in the CCS.\nMost codes reflect one person's behaviour to another (e.g., command/direct,\ncriticism, positive physical contact), although nearly all schemes contain\nconcepts such as \u201cvalidation\u201d which are inherently dependant on the prior\nbehaviour of the other. Only one scheme specifically conceptualises a dyadic\nbehaviour [discourse change; (CECS)].\n\nDeveloped for adolescents: Only three schemes were described as being\ndeveloped for adolescents (the RACS, PAICS-R, CECS). The CECS is described as\ndrawing on adolescent-specific theory, the RACS is a combination of the RPC\ndeveloped for children and the SPAFF developed for adults. The PAICS-R was\ndeveloped from an adult scheme but describes focusing on behaviours relevant\nto adolescent-parent conflict. Other schemes were either developed for\nchildren and applied to adolescents, or developed to apply to all family\nrelationships (e.g., parent-parent, parent-child, parent-adolescent).\n\nTasks: Most schemes were developed for problem-solving tasks, specifically\nconflict resolution tasks where the parent and child identify three areas of\ndisagreement and are asked to discuss them and attempt to reach a resolution.\nOne scheme was developed for a similar \u201crevealed differences\u201d task where\nparent and adolescent completed a moral judgement task and then discussed the\nanswers where they differed (CECS). The OSLC schemes are described as being\nsuitable for a variety of structured and unstructured settings (e.g.,\nmealtimes). This includes the structured task of planning an activity. The\nRACS has been used with the Family Assessment Task (69) battery of discussion\ntasks which includes tasks designed to elicit positive discussion on:\nencouragement of personal growth (parent and child pick a topic of growth,\nsuch as academic achievement, to discuss) and positive recognition of family\nmember (parent and child have a discussion about positive features of the\nother). No tasks were specifically designed to elicit shared enjoyment.\n\n##### Summary of global coding schemes\n\nTable 3 displays the identified global-coding schemes, with columns\nsummarising whether they were developed for adolescents, their history, what\ntasks they were developed for, and the type of codes contained. A briefer and\nless detailed narrative summary of the characteristics of the global schemes\nis provided below.\n\nTable 3\n\nTable 3. Summary of the characteristics of the identified adolescent-parent\nglobal-coding schemes.\n\nScheme history: schemes drew on a variety of theoretical backgrounds,\nincluding social learning theory, psychoanalytic work on ego development and\nautonomy promotion, attachment theory, family systems theory, structural\nfamily systems theory, Baumrind's (100) parenting typologies and Olson's (101)\ncircumplex theory. Some drew on research findings on conflict resolution as\nwell as on parenting of children with anxiety.\n\nCode types: as all schemes are global they combine multiple different units of\nbehaviour (e.g., speech, facial expression, body language), although some\nschemes rely more on speech (e.g., The autonomy and relatedness coding system\n(ARCS); (24)) than others which take a more balanced view of all behaviours\n(e.g., System for coding interactions and family functioning (SCIFF); (111)).\nThere is some variation across schemes in how much the codes reflect an\noverall impression or \u201cfeeling\u201d regarding the interaction, with some\ncomprising specific rules about which point on the scale is assigned [e.g.,\nARCS; (24)] and others purely relying on global impression (e.g., Coder\nimpressions questionnaire) (93). Some schemes describe all codes as dyadic\n[e.g., the Adapted Mealtime Family Interaction Coding System; MICS (91)], but\nmost include a mix of ratings about the parent and the adolescent separately,\nwith a smaller number of specific dyadic codes.\n\nDeveloped for adolescents: Seven schemes were specifically developed for\nadolescents, or adolescents and their families. These often also drew on adult\nschemes. The remainder were developed for children and applied to adolescents\nor developed for both children and adolescents.\n\nTasks: all schemes were developed for problem solving tasks, mainly conflict\ndiscussion but also revealed differences and puzzle tasks. Many schemes were\nalso used with planning tasks, typically planning a family activity. A broader\nrange of discussion tasks which were designed specifically to evoke positive\ninteractions (such as planning \u201cthe best day ever\u201d, celebrating a family\nmember) were also used with four of the schemes (the Coder Impressions\nQuestionnaire [COIMP, (93)], the Coding Interactive Behavior [CIB, (95)], the\nFamily Interaction Macro-coding System [FIMS, (102)], the Iowa Family\nInteraction Rating Scales [IFIRS, (115)].\n\n##### Overall summary\n\nLess micro- compared to global coding schemes were identified, and many of the\nidentified micro-schemes were further developments or extensions of existing\nschemes. Very few of the existing micro-coding schemes were developed\nspecifically for adolescents and so there is less influence of adolescent\nspecific theory on their development. The majority of micro-schemes were\nmostly based on social learning theory principles and were largely designed\nfor and employed with problem solving or conflict discussion tasks. Global\ncoding schemes were more commonly developed specifically for adolescents and\ndrew on a wider range of theory. Whilst conflict and problem-solving tasks\nstill predominate, these schemes have more often been employed with tasks\ndesigned to evoke positive interaction. This underscores the importance of\ndrawing on both global and micro-schemes in the development of a new\ncomprehensive and relevant adolescent coding scheme.\n\n#### Scoping public engagement\n\nThe mobile event visited 5 unique locations in the South-West of the UK, in\nbusy family areas during the school holidays, including a beach front, local\nparks in residential areas out of the city, central areas directly in the city\ncentre (close to fairgrounds and museums) and rural \u201ccar boot\u201d sales. The\nareas varied in deprivation indices and the ethnicity of the populations. The\nmobile research event received active responses (in the form of a written\nresponse on a white board and voting for proposed measures using tokens and\nslot boxes) from 234 young people and/or parents. Where votes were collected,\nwe recorded whether the vote was from an adolescent, a young adult (18\u201325) or\na parent.\n\nAcceptability of wearable head cameras: We asked families about the use of\nwearable head cameras as well as several other wearable technologies including\nrings, watches, actigraphy and on-body cameras (raw data in Supplementary file\nS2). Families had mixed views about taking part in research using wearable\ncameras: some were initially sceptical, but once it was explained that the\nproposal would be to use them for short-term interactions, not all-day\nsurveillance, the method was deemed acceptable. Young people especially\nfavoured seeing the footage capture from their own camera which represented\nthe world through their eyes.\n\nWe also heard that the advent of body worn cameras used by police and in\nsecurity settings has led to a sense of being watched in young people. At the\nheart of people's concerns was not being recorded per se, but the imbalance;\nin the police/security context, cameras are only worn by those in authority,\nand these cameras capture one perspective only. By contrast, in our proposed\nmeasure, both perspectives are represented. Young people were positive about\ncollecting footage that showed the events through their eyes, not just footage\nwatching them from another person's perspective. As shown in Figure 3, when\nasked about the acceptability of different wearable technologies in research,\n25% of adolescents were happy to wear a wearable camera. Given that the other\nwearable measures were far less intrusive and mainstream (watches and rings),\nthis demonstrates a reasonable engagement with wearable cameras. For purposes\nof illustration, Figure 1 shows two adolescents playing a card game wearing a\nwearable camera.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3. Summary of adolescent, young adult and parent views on acceptability\nof wearable technology.\n\nTask to adequately capture interactions at home: As shown in Figure 4 (raw\ndata in Supplementary file S2), the most voted for task to adequately capture\ninteractions at home was a discussion task to plan the day or week, with 40%\nof adolescents choosing this task, followed by 26% choosing meal-time, 18%\nplaying a card or board game, 8% completing chores together and 8% reviewing\ntheir day. Parents voted for mealtimes, followed by planning their day or week\nand then playing a game. Many families described that playing a board or card\ngame was not something that they would typically do, but that they would be\nhappy to do it. We brought an example game called \u201cSussed\u201d (130), a\nconversation-starter card game specifically developed for modern family\ninteractions (further described below in the pilot section). Many parents and\nadolescents enjoyed trying out the task.\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 4. Summary of adolescent and parent report views on task to capture\nadolescent-parent interaction at home.\n\nConstructs: Figure 5 presents the terms provided by parents and young people\nin a word cloud (raw data is presented in Supplementary file S3).\n\u201cUnderstanding\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d were described most often, followed by love,\ncaring, communication and respect.\n\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 5. Word cloud presenting the relationship terms reported by adolescents\nand parents.\n\n## Part 2\u2014Protocol for further work\n\nBelow we set out the next steps for the development of observational capture\nand coding of adolescent-parent interactions.\n\n### Systematic review of measurement properties of coding schemes\n\nA systematic review of the measurement properties of existing observational\nmeasures of adolescent-parent measures is required, to better understand the\nstrengths and weaknesses of existing measures, as well as to identify gaps. We\nhave registered the review with PROSPERO (CRD42023397423) and our protocol is\npublicly available at\n[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID = CRD42023397423].\nIn brief, we will conduct a new search, informed by the work presented\nearlier. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science (Core\nCollection), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Scopus and CINAHL,\nlimited to English language, without date limits. In addition, we will search\nfor unpublished studies on Google Scholar and PsyArXiv. The reference lists of\neligible studies will be manually screened to identify other relevant studies.\n\nWe will search for studies investigating psychometric properties of\nobservational measures of adolescent-parent interaction. We define such\nmeasures as any instrument in which a coder evaluates any aspect of\nadolescent-parent interaction on the basis of observed behaviour, utilising\nsome form of a coding system, which can be micro or global. We will include:\nany empirical study reporting psychometric properties of an observer-rated\nmeasure of adolescent-parent interaction; the mean age of children in the\nsample must be between 10 and 19; by parent, we refer to biological and\nadoptive parents, as well as carers whose role is that of a primary caregiver\nto the child (e.g., foster carers); studies must be in the English language;\nwe will include both published and unpublished studies that are available as\ncompleted full-text reports, including dissertations, book chapters or pre-\nprint papers. We will exclude studies of interactions with grandparents or any\nnon-primary caregiving role, as well as commentaries, letters, conference\nabstracts and review.\n\nThe aim of the review is to identify the best measures of adolescent-parent\ninteractions based on their psychometric properties, using the COnsensus-based\nStandards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) (131).\nWe will utilise the COSMIN tools for appraising study quality, adequacy of\nmeasurement properties and overall strength of evidence, which are freely\navailable at www.cosmin.nl. We will assess content validity, structural\nvalidity, internal consistency, cross-cultural validity, reliability,\nmeasurement error, criterion validity, and responsiveness. By identifying the\nexisting measures with the best evidence of adequate psychometric properties,\nwe will be able to give greater weight to such measures in terms of informing\nour own task and coding scheme.\n\n### Construct definition and measure development through focused public\nengagement workshops\n\nWe will conduct a series of workshops with adolescents, parents and health\nprofessionals, including an interactive live performance with creative arts\norganisation Made by Mortals (https://www.madebymortals.org/) to\noperationalise and \u201cbring to life\u201d the constructs identified in the scoping\npublic engagement. The adolescent workshop will include some adolescents with\nlived experience of mental health problems and accessing mental health\nservices as well as parents and professionals.\n\nIn contrast to traditional approaches to consultation through focus groups, we\nbelieve that the use of an arts-based approach will provide a more engaging\nand less abstract way to elicit views. A key strength is that the creative\narts materials presented will be based on the story of a family who will\nrepresent numerous lived experiences, without disclosing any one story\npersonally. Attendees at these workshops will be invited to share ideas\nrelating to these stories, which connect to themes arising in our earlier\npublic engagement work.\n\nThe workshops will include the use of pre-recorded audio and video clips, as\nwell as use of drama performance and opportunities to experience the task and\nwearable camera technology. We will conduct workshops at various stages in the\ndevelopment of the interaction measure, with the following aims:\n\n1\\. To inform the development of the coding system, particularly through\nexploring the extent to which theoretical constructs derived from the\nliterature align with the \u201cexperience-near\u201d perspectives of adolescents and\nparents.\n\n2\\. To inform the choice of task for the measure.\n\nHarmonisation of information from existing coding schemes with information\nfrom public engagement with adolescents and parents\n\nThis will follow a stepped process:\n\n1) Extract all codes from the identified observational parent-interaction\ncoding schemes, including both higher-order (e.g., autonomy promotion) and\nlower-order (e.g., positive affect) concepts. Codes from global coding schemes\nwill be assessed for suitability of use as micro-codes or whether they require\nseparation into multiple concepts.\n\n2) Research team will perform initial clustering of common and related codes\nand concepts to identify a taxonomy of constructs. This will involve\nadditional broad literature searching (including fields outside psychology\nsuch as philosophy and economics) on key constructs to support\noperationalisation.\n\n3) Consultation with an \u201cexpert panel\u201d of clinicians, academics and a PPI\npanel of adolescents and parents to appraise the content validity of the\nclusters and resolve any queries or lack of consensus on concepts from the\nprevious step.\n\n### Initial pilot of the wearable camera methodology to provide proof of\nconcept and initial validation study\n\n#### Methods of data capture through use of wearable cameras\n\nWe propose that recent techniques for measuring parent-infant interaction from\na first-person perspective using wearable cameras within the family home\nsetting (47, 26) could be adapted to investigate adolescent-parent\ninteraction. The advantages of such an approach are:\n\n\u2022 Increased ecological validity if used in the home setting, without the need\nfor a researcher to be present during the interaction.\n\n\u2022 Content Validity\n\n\u2218 The face-to-face view of the wearable cams captures full face view of both\ninteractors better than mounted cameras in one position only (see\nSupplementary Figure S1). This allows more subtle detections of facial\nexpressions and vocalisations.\n\n\u2218 The unique perspective allowing researchers to capture interaction \u201cthrough\nthe eyes\u201d of the young person and parent (26). Pearson and colleagues have\npreviously established that mother-infant interaction can be reliably observed\nat home using this methodology (26, 132).\n\n\u2218 Potential use of face-reader technology to automate some aspects of coding,\nthereby dramatically reducing coding time.\n\n\u2022 Therapeutic potential\n\n\u2218 This approach has significant potential for future development into video-\nfeedback intervention.\n\n\u2218 For example, the approach is currently being used to feedback to new mums in\nSouth Africa (see Cantrell et al. in this edition). Of note a goal of parents\nis often whether their child looks at them/knows them, the side-by-side view\nof mum\u2019s perspective and child perspective allows more explicit observation of\nkey moments that can be \u201cre-lived\u201d, thus reinforcement of key connecting\nbehaviours.\n\nPilot study aims: (1) Assess feasibility and acceptability of the wearable\ncamera methodology in a general population sample (2) Collect footage to apply\nmicro-coding scheme to.\n\n### Sample\n\nThe Wirral Child Health & Development study (WCHADS) is a prospective birth\ncohort of mothers, fathers and their first-born children based in the Wirral,\nUK [see Sharp et al. (133) and https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-\nhealth/research/groups/first-steps/ for further details]. The study has\ncompleted 13 waves of data collection since birth, including observations of\nparenting in the lab or at home with a researcher present at ages 6 months, 14\nmonths, 2.5 years 3.5 years, 7 and 9 years. At age 11\u201312 (N = 743) and age\n12\u201313 (N = 724) families completed postal questionnaires only. The sample are\ncurrently aged 13\u201315 years.\n\n### Procedure\n\nThe whole sample will be approached via email to invite a volunteer sample of\n50 families to participate in the pilot. The first 50 families who express\ninterest will be recruited. Families will be visited by a researcher to drop\noff the cameras and explain the procedures, and an appointment arranged for\nthe researcher to return to collect the cameras. Primary caregivers and\nadolescents will complete two tasks in their own time at home, and complete\nquestionnaires on the acceptability of the wearable cameras and the tasks and\nvalidated questionnaires assessing relationship quality.\n\n### Measures\n\n#### Observations of adolescent-parent interaction.\n\n##### The head-cameras\n\nThe head-cameras (shown in Figure 1) are small circular cameras attached to a\nmount on an elastic adjustable headband. The camera devices are off the shelf\nbody cameras. The headband mounts were created by an experienced user centred\ndesign company (Kinneir Dufort, KD) to ensure suitable positioning of the\ncamera. Footage is recorded on to a micro SD card.\n\n##### The tasks\n\nParents and adolescents will be asked to record themselves completing two\ntasks at home. The choice of task for this initial pilot was informed by the\nscoping PPI work, review of the literature, and consideration of the potential\nissues with using conflict discussion tasks at home and to evoke positive\ninteraction. In the first task, parents and adolescents are asked to play the\ncommercially available card game \u201cSussed\u201d which was developed by researchers\nand funded by the UKRI (130). \u201cSussed\u201d is a conversation starter game designed\nto improve social health by players answering multiple choice questions about\neach other, allowing players to find out how others see them, talk about how\nothers see them and understand why people think or feel a certain way. Example\nquestion: Who do I most like to work with? (A) People who are the same as me,\n(B) People who are different to me, (C) I prefer to work on my own. Parents\nand adolescents will be provided with 10 cards which were identified from the\nstandard yellow Sussed set (suitable for age 6+) and the green emotional\nhealth Sussed set (suitable for age 8+) by A level and first year\nundergraduate students. Parents and adolescents will be asked to play the game\nand record for 10 min. In the second task, the parent and adolescent are asked\nto share a drink or a snack and discuss their plans for their week, and record\nfor 5 min.\n\n##### Questionnaires\n\nSelf-developed questionnaires to assess acceptability of the methodology:\nQuestions ask about the acceptability of using the wearable cameras, the tasks\nthey were asked to complete, and their thoughts on collecting footage from the\nfirst-person perspective of both mother and adolescents. Parent and adolescent\nreport.\n\nAdolescent-parent relationship quality: the Network of Relationships (NRI)\n\u201cseeks safe haven\u201d subscale (support seeking from parent, parent and\nadolescent report) (134), the brief version of the Parental Feelings\nQuestionnaire (positive and negative feelings about child, parent report and\nadapted for adolescent) (135) and the trust subscale of the Inventory of\nParent and Peer Attachment (IPPA, adolescent report) (136).\n\n### Planned output\n\nFeasibility indices: this will include proportion of families invited to use\nthe wearable cameras that agree to take part, of those who agree how many\nprovide footage, we will also record reasons for not managing to obtain\nrecorded footage, challenges in both the initial recruitment and the recording\nof interactions. For example, a similar protocol was developed for parents and\ninfants in the ALSPAC study (Using a wearable camera at home\u2014Children of the\nChildren of the 90s\u2014YouTube). Such information can be used to inform protocols\nfor use in cohort studies, time needed for researcher time and likely uptake.\nPotential cohorts include ALSPAC-G2 (137).\n\nProof of concept: recorded footage will be used to develop the adolescent-\nparent coding scheme by testing application of identified \u201cbehaviour\ngroupings\u201d/parent-child interaction codes to the videos in order to refine\ndefinitions.\n\n1\\. Initial reliability and validation study: inter-rater reliability of the\nnewly identified coding scheme will be assessed. Self-reported relationship\nquality will be used to provide an initial exploration of construct validity\nof the observed adolescent-parent relationship constructs. Given the sample\nsize of 40 power will be too low to provide strong statistical evidence for\nassociations between self-report and observations, which are expected to be\naround effect sizes of 0.3 based on previous studies linking observed and\nself-report of parenting (25).\n\n### Co-design of a comprehensive and relevant coding scheme in consultation\nwith an expert panel and lay/PPI panel\n\nAgreed behavioural domains will be operationally defined and incorporated into\nan Observer XT coding structure. We will apply the coding structure to the\nWCHADS videos and consult with experts and young people as \u201ccoders\u201d to\ndetermine face validity regarding whether the defined behaviours can be\napplied to live behaviour examples. The aim is that multiple, diverse coders\ncan use the coding scheme to accurately capture all behaviours and dyadic\nbehaviours observed in real life interactions, and that multiple coders give\nthe same code for the same observation (inter-rater reliability). The coding\nscheme will be refined during this process and may include updated codes to\ncapture behaviours that emerge and redefinition of behaviours that do not\nreach inter-rater-reliability. Once finalised we will publish an open access,\nco-developed, fully illustrated manual of behavioural codes and observer\nsyntax in the same way that we have for micro-coding in the early years (47).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe initial work presented in this paper suggests that there is a need to co-\ndesign both new methods of data capture, and new coding schemes, to assess\nadolescent-parent interaction. In our scoping review, we identified that\nnumerous observational measures have been developed over the years, but fewer\ncoding schemes were developed specifically with adolescents in mind this was\nparticularly the case in existing micro-coding schemes. None of the coding\nschemes were co-designed with adolescents. This is important since adolescence\nconstitutes a unique period in which parent-child relationships are in\ntransition in a variety of ways, such as becoming more symmetrical as\nadolescents develop more independence and autonomy (4), therefore requiring\nadolescent-specific theory to guide their development.\n\nOur initial review of the evidence indicates that negative and conflictual\nparent-child interaction processes are well characterised, largely by the\napplication of social learning theory principles such as Patterson's coercive\ncycle (34). In the programme of work described here we place emphasis on\ncharacterising the more positive aspects of adolescent-parent interaction.\nPositive adolescent-parent relationships are associated with greater\nadolescent well-being (38), and the most promising relational interventions\nare strengths based (138, 139). Consistent with a focus on problematic\ninteractions, we note that a large number of data capture methods utilise\nproblem-solving or conflict-related tasks. Whilst conflict tasks are used to\ncode positive adolescent-parent interaction qualities, they are less likely to\nevoke positive interaction qualities (14, 15), and the negative affect and\narousal which accompanies conflict (29\u201331) may mean they are not best suited\nto assess positive interactions. In addition, measures eliciting conflict may\nbe less suitable for use in the home context, in the absence of researchers.\n\nPlanning activities were also quite commonly used, particularly in studies\nemploying global scales. Planning discussions involves some problem solving\nand negotiation but are not conflict based. We also identified some structured\ndiscussion tasks designed to elicit positive interactions, including\ncelebrating a family member and parent encouragement of an area of personal\ngrowth in the child or planning a fun family activity (69). In our public\nengagement work we asked families what the best contexts at home would be to\nobserve their most natural adolescent-parent interaction at home. Planning\ntheir day or week was the most voted for task. Given the focus in infancy\nobservation on tasks which elicit shared enjoyment, and our aim to observe\npositive adolescent-parent interaction, we also suggested a card game task\nwhich most families found acceptable. There has been very little consideration\nin the literature on the content and ecological validity of different\nobservational tasks, particularly in relation to characterising positive\ninteractions, in adolescence. This is essential for developing a method to\nadequately characterise adolescent-parent relationships.\n\nIn our public engagement work, we found that parents and adolescents were open\nto the possibility of utilising technology such as wearable cameras or heart-\nrate monitors and the possibility of automated technology coding behaviours.\nIn terms of content validity, we have found that the most relevant concepts\nexpressed in PPI work such as Trust and Understanding are not explicitly\ncovered in existing coding or assessment tools. These higher-order concepts\nare likely represented by multiple individual codes contained in existing\nschemes. Careful conceptual and practical mapping of top down and bottom-up\ncontent will be required to ensure new coding schemes capture what is seen as\nmost relevant.\n\nOur work thus far has some limitations. Firstly, since the literature on\nobservational adolescent-parent measures appears to use a wide range of terms,\nit is probable that our scoping review may have missed some existing measures.\nIn addition, as most observational coding schemes are not published and can be\ndifficult to locate, our review is likely not complete. Secondly, whilst our\npublic engagement work will have reached individuals not usually approached by\nresearchers and contained a diversity of class and ethnicity, it was\nexclusively conducted in the South-West of England. Future public engagement\nwork should be conducted in other regions of the United Kingdom prior to\ndeveloping the coding scheme or undertaking formal validation studies.\nFurthermore, we are currently evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of\nthe measure in a community sample of adolescents, which will shed light on the\npotential use of the measure for research purposes in cohort studies. As\ndiscussed earlier in this paper, the use of the measure for different purposes\nand different populations requires additional evidence to support each\nspecific use. In particular, the use of the measure in clinical samples,\neither for research or therapeutic purposes, will require separate evaluation\nin research studies. The suitability of the measure for individuals with\nlearning disabilities or an autism spectrum condition also requires\nevaluation.\n\nIn summary, the work presented and planned here represents the first attempt\nto truly co-create a method to assess parenting in adolescence, combining\nbottom-up processes to harness insights from adolescents and parents, with\ntop-down approaches to utilise and build on existing theory and research. By\nusing creative approaches to public engagement, as well as rigorous plans for\npsychometric investigation, we hope to develop an observational measure that\ncaptures salient aspects of adolescent-parent interaction using novel\ntechnological methods, which can be used across a range of research and\ntherapeutic settings.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the\narticle/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the\ncorresponding author.\n\n## Ethics statement\n\nAn ethics checklist for the scoping public engagement van tour was submitted\nto the University of Bristol School of Psychologys IRB and met criteria for\nautomatic approval (no reference number required).
