Admirers often\ntalk about his distinctive style. But I\u2019ve never seen a detailed analysis of\nGraham as a writer, as a stylist. Some people have sent me a couple of\nexamples, but they were either very good but not detailed enough, or simply\nnot an analysis at all. Several people recommended David Perell, but here\u2019s\nPerell\u2019s point number eight.\n\n> Don\u2019t try to develop a personal style. PG says: \u201cIf you just try to make\n> good things, you\u2019ll inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each\n> person walks in a distinctive way.\u201d\n\nEh, maybe. But what I want to know is, what is that personal style? What makes\nGraham\u2019s writing his? Good writers may not consciously develop their own style\n(though I think they do, at least partially) but even if their style emerges\nindirectly that doesn\u2019t make it unworthy of attention. As I wrote in my essay\non Malcolm Gladwell, good writing is the result of careful structure and\nsyntax. \u201cProper words in proper places make the true definition of style.\u201d\nThis is my attempt to understand how Paul Graham does that.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see, I believe Graham uses what\u2019s called the plain style, and that\nhe does so with rhetorical techniques that make his writing persuasive and\npleasant to read. He may not have studied rhetoric in order to write like\nthis. But he\u2019s a well read, literary person. One way or another, he\u2019s worked\nhimself into this particular form of writing. Studying his techniques will be\ninteresting for his readers and possibly useful for others who want to write\nessays.\n\n####\n\nFirst, genre.\n\nGraham writes essays. In modern terms, he probably belongs to the \u201chow stuff\nworks\u201d genre, an internet-based mode that demonstrates the mechanics of how\nthings work. Think of Brian Potter or Massimo. Potter writes long posts on\ntopics like \u201cWhy is it so hard to build an airport?\u201d Graham writes about how\nstart-ups work, how coding works, how talent works, how education works, and\nso on. Several of his essay titles begin \u201cHow to...\u201d.\n\nBut, Graham is also writing in an older tradition. The modern \u201chow stuff\nworks\u201d genre is often impartial, detailed writing, with high information\ndensity, like\n\nFreakTakes\n\nby\n\nEric Gilliam\n\n(strongly recommended). It\u2019s not dull, but it is fairly impersonal. Graham,\nhowever, is always present in his writing. In this way, he reminds me of the\nolder \u201chow stuff works\u201d essayists like Francis Bacon. Like Bacon, he has a\nstyle that is immediately recognisable.\n\nBacon wrote short, exploratory essays about a wide range of Renaissance\nsubjects: gardens, revenge, politics, atheism, wisdom, friendship and so on.\nGraham has this breadth. Whereas many \u201chow stuff works\u201d essays would be out of\nplace in some way in an anthology of essays that traversed the centuries, some\nof Graham\u2019s writing might not. Graham also shares Bacon\u2019s direct experience of\nwhat he writes about. He is to SF/tech/startup/coding culture as Bacon was to\nthe English Renaissance. He\u2019s a player in the game, writing from experience as\nwell as learning.\n\nThe final element of Graham\u2019s genre is \u201cmarketing content\u201d. I don\u2019t know that\nhe wrote these essays primarily as marketing for Y Combinator, but some of the\nearlier essays have a banner saying \u201cWant to start a startup? Get funded by Y\nCombinator.\u201d Graham began writing in the early 2000s, the age of content\nmarketing. This content often blended the styles of op-eds, blogging, direct\nresponse advertising copy, and traditional essays. Graham is not writing \u201chard\nsell\u201d pieces, but he has the direct response writer\u2019s ability to arrange\ninformation persuasively, to write long form, and to insist on his central\npoint.\n\nObviously it\u2019s high-end stuff\u2014he\u2019s not selling diet pills\u2014but still, his genre\nis partly a product of the internet of its time. Few other organisations have\nachieved the same \u201creach\u201d, \u201cengagement\u201d, and \u201cbrand value\u201d as Graham\u2019s essays\nhave (jargon which Graham would surely write as: \u201clots of people read,\nenjoyed, and talked about the essays\u201d). Sometimes the best marketing isn\u2019t\nintended as marketing.\n\nPart of the advertising side of Graham\u2019s style comes from him being\ndeceptively personal. He doesn\u2019t write personal essays of the sort that\ndivulge messy details about his life, but he does often take himself, his\nexperiences, as his starting point, rather than something aphoristic or\ndefinitional. He is anecdotal, as is so much of the best advertising.\n\nThe essence of this genre, from Bacon to blogging, is its use of the plain\nstyle.\n\n####\n\nSecond, style.\n\nGraham is plain, but he\u2019s not always pithy. Look at the opening of \u201cIs It\nWorth Being Wise?\u201d\n\n> A few days ago I finally figured out something I\u2019ve wondered about for 25\n> years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence. Anyone can see\n> they\u2019re not the same by the number of people who are smart, but not very\n> wise. And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem related. How?\n\nWhereas Bacon\u2019s openings were often declamatory\u2014\u201cGod Almighty first planted a\ngarden\u201d or \u201cMen fear death as children fear to go in the dark\u201d or \u201cRevenge is\na kind of wild justice\u201d\u2014Graham\u2019s are often anecdotal, such as: \u201cBefore I had\nkids, I was afraid of having kids\u201d or \u201cWhen we sold our startup in 1998 I\nsuddenly got a lot of money.\u201d\n\nWhat links them is that both are plain: they are direct and un-ornamented.\nThey get to the point. There is no poetry, no fuss.\n\nGraham is well-known for his simplicity. He says, \u201cyou don\u2019t need complex\nsentences to explain complex ideas.\u201d His method for achieving this simplicity\nis to write like he speaks. \u201cIf you simply manage to write in spoken language,\nyou\u2019ll be ahead of 95% of writers.\u201d But this isn\u2019t as simple as it looks. When\nyou read a transcript of an interview, you will notice lots of fragmented\nsyntax. People start sentences, stop, rephrase, and carry on\u2014or simply switch\nto a new sentence. (In rhetorical terms this is called anacoluthon.)\n\nThus a true speech-writing would be a little irritating, or modernist if taken\nfar enough. Matt Levine does it by adding \u201clike\u201d frequently, which is not only\nan internet-age-ism, but a verbal tic traditionally left out of formal\nwriting. Graham doesn\u2019t quite do that either.\n\nInstead, Graham writes like he speaks in the same sense that a play or film is\nrealistic. When someone picks up the phone on television or in a movie, they\ndon\u2019t actually talk realistically. The silences and \u201cuhms\u201d and \u201cuh huhs\u201d\u2014and\nthe fragmented syntax\u2014would be boring, maybe confusing. They have to simulate\nrealism. They do enough to make it believable. What Graham does is to write as\nif he were going to deliver a speech. (Some of his essays are speeches, and it\nis notable how similar they are to the essays written to be read online.)\n\nHe is a conversational writer. It\u2019s not literal conversation, but a\nconversational style: casual, anecdotal. Look at this extract from \u201cTaste for\nMakers\u201d to see what I mean:\n\n> Mathematicians call good work \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and so, either now or in the\n> past, have scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers, writers,\n> and painters. Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is\n> there some overlap in what they meant? If there is an overlap, can we use\n> one field\u2019s discoveries about beauty to help us in another?\n>\n> For those of us who design things, these are not just theoretical questions.\n> If there is such a thing as beauty, we need to be able to recognize it. We\n> need good taste to make good things. Instead of treating beauty as an airy\n> abstraction, to be either blathered about or avoided depending on how one\n> feels about airy abstractions, let\u2019s try considering it as a practical\n> question: how do you make good stuff?\n\nEach sentences makes one point, which draws on the thread of the last. As in\nconversation, he doesn\u2019t reductively state his question in one clean sentence,\nbut sets out each stage of his thinking. He could have written it like this.\n\n> Beauty is real, and experienced across disciplines. That means it might be a\n> useful thing for makers and designers to understand. So, let\u2019s treat it\n> practically and ask not \u201cWhat is beauty?\u201d but \u201chow can we make good stuff?\u201d\n\nWe can see immediately that, despite the fact Graham edits his essays until\nthey cannot be edited any more, he doesn\u2019t write in the shortest possible\nmanner. He is expansive, but in the way that conversation is expansive. The\nfirst two sentences of the second paragraph essentially repeat each other.\nInstead of \u201cFor those of us who design things, these are not just theoretical\nquestions. If there is such a thing as beauty, we need to be able to recognize\nit.\u201d he could have written, \u201cDesigners need to be able to recognise beauty.\u201d\n\nThus, Paul Graham writes with a rhetorical plainness.\n\n####\n\nThird, rhetoric\n\nGraham isn\u2019t only interested in simplicity. These repetitions and refinements\nare a form of persuasive rhetoric. They maintain your attention and persuade\nyou small point by small point. Graham takes nothing for granted. His style is\nbased around the idea that his sentences will form links like a silver chain.\nCompare my version to his again. Mine sounds too brisk; you have to sit with\nit. Graham breaks each point down to its smallest, most precise iteration. He\nillustrates (as with the list of disciplines); he recapitulates (as with the\nrepetition of \u201coverlap\u201d); he rephrases to achieve balance (counterpointing\n\u201cnot theoretical\u201d with \u201cneed to understand\u201d); he enters, silently, with\npartisan language (\u201cairy abstractions\u201d, \u201cblathered\u201d). You feel like you are\nreading the notes taken down at a lecture by a charismatic, opinionated\nexpert.\n\nIndeed, his use of counterpoint, or what in rhetoric is called parallelism can\nbe seen in the two opening lines of his I quoted earlier. \u201cBefore I had kids,\nI was afraid of having kids\u201d and \u201cWhen we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly\ngot a lot of money.\u201d Notice how the two halves of these sentences are\nbalanced: had and having, sold and suddenly. And the ideas are balanced too:\nbefore and afraid, sold and money. This is a classical rhetorical style. It is\nalso poetic, being the foundation of poetry from the Bible to Walt Whitman.\nPart of how Graham makes his simple writing sound so mellifluous is through\nthese rhetorical patterns. He puts simple words into the structures, but they\nare so well used he gets the benefit of their rhythm and cadence. This is much\nmore carefully organised than speech.\n\nGraham also uses the rhetorical technique of antipophora. Antipophora is self-\ndebate. Rather than the asking of rhetorical questions designed to not be\nanswered, it is a series of questions rhetorically asked and answered by the\nsame person. It\u2019s not uncommon in the soliloquies of Shakespeare\u2019s characters.\nThink of Falstaff, explaining to the audience why he will not let the idea of\n\u201chonour\u201d force him into battle:\n\n> ... honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I come on?\n> how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or an arm? no: or take away the grief\n> of a wound? no. Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is honour? a\n> word. What is in that word honour? what is that honour? air. A trim\n> reckoning! Who hath it? he that died o\u2019 Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no. Doth\n> he hear it? no. \u2019Tis insensible, then. Yea, to the dead. But will it not\n> live with the living? no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I\u2019ll\n> none of it.\n\nNow, compare that to these paragraphs from \u201cIs It Worth Being Wise?\u201d.\n\n> What is wisdom? I\u2019d say it\u2019s knowing what to do in a lot of situations. I\u2019m\n> not trying to make a deep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just\n> to figure out how we use the word. A wise person is someone who usually\n> knows the right thing to do.\n>\n> And yet isn\u2019t being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations? For\n> example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells your elementary school\n> class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100?\n>\n> Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems\u2014wisdom\n> to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones. But that isn\u2019t true.\n> Some wisdom has nothing to do with people: for example, the wisdom of the\n> engineer who knows certain structures are less prone to failure than others.\n> And certainly smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as\n> well as abstract ones.\n\nGraham often doesn\u2019t use antipophora, to be clear. Many of his essays contain\nno questions. But in those essays, he has other forms of rhetoric. Look at the\nopening from \u201cThe Bus Ticket Theory of Genius\u201d.\n\n> Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and\n> determination. But there\u2019s a third ingredient that\u2019s not as well understood:\n> an obsessive interest in a particular topic.\n\nFirst, the power of three, or tricolon. (To make it more obvious, recast the\nsentence like this: To do great work, you need natural ability, determination,\nand an obsessive interest in a particular topic.) Note that the final idea,\n\u201cobsessive interest in a particular topic\u201d, is a longer phrase than the first\ntwo, a good use of tricolon to put the focus on the most important part and to\ngive euphony. The length gives a sense of building towards the focal point.\nThere\u2019s also repetition (\u201cyou need\u201d, \u201ca third ingredient\u201d) and parallellism\n(\u201ceveryone knows\u201d versus \u201cnot as well understood\u201d.) Again, note how much this\nmakes Graham\u2019s style akin to a speech. Even the phrase \u201cEveryone knows\u201d is\nrhetoric. It assumes you know (or lets you pretend you did, or immediately\nteaches you something you ought to know.) It\u2019s a form of getting the reader on\nside, of being conversational but also intelligent. Think again of Graham as a\nbrilliant, charismatic lecturer\u2014you all know this... (Compare that to the\nopening of Bacon\u2019s essay Of Seeming Wise, \u201cIt hath been an opinion...\u201d)\n\nFor all his rhetoric, Graham is still plain. None of this is ornamental or\nrococo. Graham once defined the best essay like this: \u201cThe best essay would be\non the most important topic you could tell people something surprising about.\u201d\nTo do this, he says, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have a complete thesis; you just need\nsome kind of gap you can explore.\u201d Exploring a gap is exactly how we can\nexplain his style: parallelism is inherently exploratory, a literal \u201con the\none hand, one the other\u201d kind of style. Antipophora too.\n\nSo we reach an unexpected conclusion. Graham is not trying to write in the\nmost concise way, but the most concise way that is simultaneously exploratory\nand persuasive. He wants to anticipate your questions without becoming dry and\nfussy. Combining a logic-chopping structure with discursive, vernacular,\nanecdotal language is what gives Graham his own personal style, like a\nreformed theologian in sandals who has renounced jargon but retains his deep\nlearning in rhetoric.\n\nThe other thing he likes to do is tell a story.\n\n####\n\nFourth, narrative\n\nGraham is well read. He admires writers like P.G. Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh,\nNancy Mitford, Jane Austen. And he borrows the techniques of fiction. Here\u2019s\nthe opening of \u201cThe Reddits\u201d.\n\n> I met the Reddits before we even started Y Combinator. In fact they were one\n> of the reasons we started it.\n\nThis is so novelistic. Compare it to the opening line of On the Road.\n\n> I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten\n> over a serious illness that I won\u2019t bother to talk about, except that it had\n> something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that\n> everything was dead.\n\nThis is not to say Graham is directly imitating this book, but you see a\npattern. You open by dropping right into the situation, and in the second\nsentence you make some switch, a twist that gives new context that gives the\nfirst sentence a bigger meaning. Novelists like to open with drama and\nproblems, Graham with a nugget of interesting information, but the pattern of\nthe sentences is comparable.\n\nThe Reddits continues like this:\n\n> YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the undergrad\n> computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone else in the audience\n> was probably local, but Steve and Alexis came up on the train from the\n> University of Virginia, where they were seniors. Since they\u2019d come so far I\n> agreed to meet them for coffee. They told me about the startup idea we\u2019d\n> later fund them to drop: a way to order fast food on your cellphone.\n\nThis is an example of the simulated realism I mentioned above. Of course, this\nsounds like Graham as he really is. But because of the way he structures it\nlike story (thirty-two words of context before getting back to \u201cthe Reddits\u201d)\nit also sounds like a narrator, a sort of mini character. Notice, too, the\nprolepsis combined with litotes (jargon for foreshadowing with understatement,\nyet another form of rheotric: \u201cthe startup idea we\u2019d later fund them to drop\u201d)\nwhich is also characteristic of a fictional narrator. In this way, like a good\nconversationalist, or someone telling a joke, Graham is setting up his story.\nWe are hooked to follow-up on these details.\n\nWe can find some of the inspiration for this writing style in Graham\u2019s essay\n\u201cSome Heroes\u201d. Of Kenneth Clark, the art historian, Graham says, \u201cHis style is\ndeceptively casual, but there is more in his books than in a library of art\nmonographs.\u201d Deceptively casual is a good description of the mid-century\nAmerican fiction voice Graham was channeling in the opening of \u201cThe Reddits\u201d.\nAnd it sums up Graham\u2019s use of rhetoric in the plain style. It looks simple,\nas simple as spontaneous talk. It is, however, carefully structured to be\nexploratory and persuasive.\n\nThis, in turn, links to his admiration for Wodehouse, Waugh, and Mitford.\n\n> Wodehouse may have begun with simple atoms, but the way he composed them\n> into molecules was near faultless. His rhythm in particular. It makes me\n> self-conscious to write about it. I can think of only two other writers who\n> came near him for style: Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford. Those three used\n> the English language like they owned it.\n\nAgain, I am not directly comparing Graham to these writers, but those are very\nself descriptive ideas: simple atoms, rhythmically composed, in a manner that\nonly comes from using language like you own it. Wodehouse wrote \u201cexactly as he\nwanted\u201d\u2014Graham too.\n\n### Subscribe to The Common Reader\n\nBy Henry Oliver \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nEssays for interesting people about talent, literature, and biography. \"One of\nmy favourite Substacks.\" Helen Lewis\n\n64 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n9 Restacks\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Paul Graham's plain rhetoric\n\nwww.commonreader.co.uk\n\n19\n\nShare\n\n19 Comments\n\nTed GioiaThe Honest BrokerApr 15Liked by Henry OliverThis is very good.Expand\nfull commentLike (4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Henry Oliver\n\nAlice WellsApr 15Liked by Henry OliverI really enjoyed this piece, thank you!\nWriting for a reader is so simple...and yet so difficult!Expand full\ncommentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Henry Oliver\n\n17 more comments...\n\nThe case for opsimaths.
