But my aversion to IUTs has always bordered on\nthe pathological.\n\nWhen people say they procrastinate by doing minor chores instead of the big,\nimportant thing they're meant to be doing, I envy their productivity. I\nsuspect people do this to make themselves feel like they're doing something,\neven if it's not what they should be doing. But I have a high tolerance for\nsitting with the gnawing feeling that I'm doing nothing when I should be doing\nsomething; which enables me to put off IUTs for hours, days, weeks, sometimes\nmonths.\n\nI find it hard to analyse the process of putting off an IUT, because it's such\na fleeting act. But I think it looks something like this:\n\n  1. I remember that I need to do X\n  2. I feel an aversion to doing X\n  3. I decide to put X off until later\n\nLater:\n\n  1. I remember that I still need to do X...\n\nAnd so on. This process happens so quickly, and subconsciously, that I barely\nnotice it happening. In Daniel Kahneman parlance: system 1 will whisk the\nthought safely away before system 2 has a chance to wake up.\n\nI don't expect to ever find a silver-bullet solution to this problem that will\nturn me into a person who instinctively does what's required. Though I live in\nhope. But recently I've been trying to interrupt the procrastination process\nwith this rule:\n\n> I should try to notice when I don't want to do X, and, when I notice, force\n> myself to do X.\n\nIdeally this should make the process of remembering an IUT look like this:\n\n  1. I remember that I need to do X\n  2. I feel an aversion to doing X\n  3. I notice that I don't want to do X\n  4. I use my rule about doing things I don't want to do to force myself to do X\n\nThis isn't meant to be a cast-iron rule; there are times when doing X actually\nisn't appropriate (in which case I'll often try to stop and set a reminder to\ndo X at an appropriate time). It's meant to rest control of this process from\nmy lizard brain, that acts on impulse, and hand it over to the conscious part\nof my brain, where there's at least some chance I'll be able to make a\nreasonable decision about it.\n\nDoing this feels like it works, like it increases the rate at which I win\ninternal battles. This could either be because it actually does work, or\nbecause it draws my attention to the times when I manage to overcome inertia.\nIf it's the latter, then it's possible that it might have the opposite of its\nintended effect, by making me feel like I've achieved more than I actually\nhave, and luring me into complacency. Worse still, this strategy is so\nsubjective, I can't think of a way you could be empirical about checking\nwhether it works. But it feels like it does, and it might. So I'm going to\nkeep on using it.\n\nCopyright Tony Onodi 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
