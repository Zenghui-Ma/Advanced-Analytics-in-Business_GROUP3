Legislators targeted the proliferation of these inexpensive\nand frequently unreliable weapons, ostensibly because they were believed to\npose a risk to their owners and facilitate criminality. This was not an issue\nunique to the US or to that time period, of course; in the UK, where handguns\nare now strictly regulated, criminals often resort to reactivated, or even\nhome-made or antique, firearms.\n\nDespite \u2018junk guns\u2019 often being inaccurate and prone to malfunction,\npurchasing or creating them does have advantages for a would-be criminal. Such\nweapons are unlikely to be on law enforcement\u2019s radar, and can be difficult to\ntrace. They tend to be cheap, lowering the cost of entry to illicit ownership\nand usage. And they can often be made or obtained without needing access to\nextensive criminal networks.\n\nDuring a recent investigation into several underground cybercrime forums \u2013\nparticularly those frequented by lower-skilled threat actors \u2013 Sophos X-Ops\ndiscovered something interesting: a ransomware equivalent to junk guns.\n\nWe found multiple examples of independently produced, inexpensive, and\ncrudely-constructed ransomware, mostly sold as a one-time purchase rather than\ntypical affiliate-based Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) models (and none of the\n\u2018junk-gun ransomware\u2019 we found appears on the ransomwatch group index as of\nthis writing). This appears to be a relatively new phenomenon (although, of\ncourse, threat actors have been creating and selling cheap, low-quality RATs\nand other malware for decades). We also saw other threat actors, a rung or two\ndown the skills ladder, express interest in developing new ransomware \u2013\nswapping tips on languages, evasion techniques, targets, and licencing models.\n\nAt first glance, the prospect of individuals making and selling junk-gun\nransomware doesn\u2019t seem to pose a significant threat; it\u2019s a far cry from the\nnotorious, well-organized ransomware groups that usually come to mind. Here,\nthere are no leak sites; no initial access brokers (IABs); no affiliates; no\ncorporate-like hierarchies; no multi-million dollar ransom demands; no\npublicity stunts; no high-profile targets; no sophisticated malware intended\nto defeat advanced EDR products; no seeking headlines and media attention; and\nlittle in-depth analysis by researchers.\n\nBut as we dug deeper, we uncovered some concerning intelligence. Some\nindividuals claimed to have used junk-gun ransomware in real-world attacks,\ncompleting the entire attack chain by themselves, without IABs. Others\nadvocated using it to attack small businesses and individuals \u2013 targets that\nthe likes of Cl0p and ALPHV/BlackCat would probably not consider worthwhile,\nbut which could nevertheless generate significant profit for an individual\nthreat actor. Some users claimed to prefer standalone ransomware because they\ndon\u2019t have to profit-share \u2013 as in many RaaS models \u2013 or rely on\ninfrastructure developed and operated by others.\n\nAway from the complex infrastructure of modern ransomware, junk-gun ransomware\nallows criminals to get in on the action cheaply, easily, and independently.\nThey can target small companies and individuals, who are unlikely to have the\nresources to defend themselves or respond effectively to incidents, without\ngiving anyone else a cut.\n\nOf course, junk-gun ransomware may occasionally blow up in threat actors\u2019\nfaces \u2013 it may be defective, trigger alerts, or be backdoored as part of a\nscam \u2013 or their own lack of experience may result in failure or detection. In\ntheir minds, however, these are likely acceptable risks \u2013 not least because\nusing junk-gun ransomware may eventually lead to more lucrative employment\nopportunities with prominent ransomware gangs.\n\nIn this article we\u2019ll reveal our findings, share details of the junk-gun\nransomware we found, and discuss the implications for organizations, the wider\npublic, and the security community.\n\n# Off-the-shelf junk-gun ransomware\n\nWe observed 19 junk-gun ransomware varieties either offered for sale or cited\nas being under development, across four forums, between June 2023 and February\n2024. Our findings are summarized in the table below.\n\nName| Date posted| Status| Price| Language| Used in attacks| Detection|\nFeatures  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCatLogs| December 2023| For sale| Unknown| .NET| Unknown| Unknown| Stealer,\nRAT, ransomware, clipper, keylogger  \nUnnamed console app| November 2023| In development| N/A| C#| N/A| Defender,\n2/70 VT| Loops over desktop, documents, pictures, music, videos  \nCustom RaaS| July 2023| For sale| $200| Unknown| Unknown| Unknown| RSA\n2048/4096, anti-VM and debugger, UAC bypass, random extensions  \nDiablo| January 2024| For sale| $50 per month| Unknown| Unknown| Defender|\nAES, threaded, external drives, offline mode, Defender bypass, persistence  \nEvil Extractor| December 2023| For sale| $99 \u2013 $199 per month| Unknown| Yes|\nUnknown| Stealer, RAT, ransomware, FTP server, crypter, persistence, self-\ndestruct, anti-VM  \nHardShield| September 2023| Open source| Free| C++| Unknown| Unknown| CBC\nAES128+RSA 2048, delete shadow copies, threaded, self-deletion  \nJigsaw| June 2023| For sale| $500| .NET| Unknown| Multiple| Offline\nencryption, AES-RSA, threaded  \nKryptina| December 2023| For sale| $20 for single build / $800 for source code\n/ free| C| Unknown| Unknown| Targets Linux, threaded, offline, AES-256 CBC  \nLolicrypt| August 2023| For sale| $1000| Unknown| Yes| Unknown| Intermittent\nencryption, chacha20, cross-platform  \nLoni| July 2023| For sale| $999 per month / $9999 lifetime| C| Unknown|\nUnknown| Remote, delete shadow copies, self-destruct, XTEA, intermittent\nencryption  \nNevermore| October 2023| For sale| $250| C#| Unknown| Defender| AES-256,\nthreaded, stealer, unique payloads,  \nRansomTuga| June 2023| Open source| Free| C++| Unknown| Multiple| Stealer  \nYasmha| February 2024| For sale| $500| C#| Unknown| Multiple| N/A  \nErgon| September 2023| For sale| 0.5 BTC per compile, 2.5 BTC for source code|\nUnknown| Yes| Unknown| Custom builds, support, RaaS model  \nUnnamed ransomware| September 2023| In development| N/A| Go| N/A| Unknown|\nSalsa20 encryption  \nUnnamed ransomware| July 2023| For sale| $1000| C++| Unknown| Unknown|\nThreaded, delete shadow copies, self-delete, partial and full encryption  \nUnnamed ransomware| January 2024| For sale| $60| Unknown| Unknown| Unknown|\nCustomer provides RSA keys, ransom note, desktop background, etc  \nUnnamed ransomware| February 2024| For sale| $50| Python| Unknown| Unknown|\nUnknown  \nUnnamed ransomware| June 2023| For sale| $500| Unknown| Unknown| Unknown| No\ndecryption key  \n  \nTable 1: An overview of the off-the-shelf junk-gun ransomware varieties we\nobserved on four criminal forums, between June 2023 and February 2024\n\n## Cheap and cheerless\n\nOf the 19 varieties we found, one had no price listed, two were open-source,\nand two were under active development and therefore had no price listed.\nPrices for the remaining 14 ranged from $20 (for a single build of Kryptina;\nwe later noted that the Kryptina developer released their ransomware for free\nafter struggling to make sales) to 0.5 BTC, or approximately $13,000 at the\ntime of the posting.\n\nFigure 1: One of the adverts for Kryptina\n\nFigure 2: A screenshot showing a build of Kryptina, provided by the seller as\npart of their promotional materials\n\nFigure 3: An advert for an unnamed junk-gun ransomware written in C++, offered\nfor sale on a criminal forum\n\nThat 0.5 BTC price (for a single build of Ergon) appears to be something of an\noutlier, however. The median average price across all varieties was $375, and\nthe mode was $500. The mean average was $1,302 including Ergon, but $402.15\nwithout. That\u2019s notably cheap, given that some RaaS affiliates reportedly pay\nup to thousands of dollars for access to kits (although note that some kits\ncost much less).\n\nFigure 4: A post promoting the Ergon ransomware. Note the claim that Ergon\n\u201chas been used in multiple attacks with extremly [sic] high success rate\n[emphasis in original].\u201d We\u2019ll cover in-the-wild junk-gun ransomware attacks\nshortly\n\nFigure 5: As well as its high price, Ergon was also an outlier in that its\ndeveloper(s) asked for 10% of any revenue from attacks; we didn\u2019t see this\nsort of stipulation anywhere else during our research\n\nMost junk-gun ransomware was available for a single, one-off price. Only three\nadopted any sort of subscription model (Diablo, with licences at $50 per\nmonth; Evil Extractor, at $99 \u2013 $199 per month depending on the selected\n\u2018plan\u2019; and Loni, at $999 per month or $9,999 for a lifetime licence). Both\nKryptina and Ergon also offered source code at a premium cost, relative to the\nprice of a single build ($800 for Kryptina, and 2.5BTC, or about $39,000, for\nErgon).\n\nFigure 6: A post advertising the Diablo ransomware, with a subscription price\nof $50 per month\n\nFigure 7: The available \u2018packages\u2019 for Evil Extractor\n\nInterestingly, at least two examples of junk-gun ransomware \u2013 Diablo and\nJigsaw \u2013 use names associated with historic ransomware families. Diablo was a\nvariant of Locky in 2017, and Jigsaw (previously BitcoinBlackmailer) was\nreleased in 2016. This may be a coincidence, and neither seller stated that\ntheir ransomware was linked to these earlier families. That didn\u2019t stop some\nusers wondering if there was a connection, particularly in the case of Jigsaw\n\u2013 although the seller denied this.\n\nFigure 8: The Jigsaw seller/developer denies being connected to \u201cthe old\njigsaw\u201d ransomware\n\nIt\u2019s possible that these threat actors are deliberately using the names of\nearlier, well-known ransomware to benefit from \u2018brand recognition\u2019 and give\ntheir junk gun variants an air of \u2018legitimacy\u2019 \u2013 despite the fact that they\nmay be counterfeits.\n\nIn any case, it appears that at least some junk-gun ransomware developers are\nmaking money from their products. While the Kryptina developer admitted that\nthey had struggled to turn a profit, the Nevermore developer said that they\nhad made \u201cmore than I expected\u201d from ransomware.\n\nFigure 9: The Nevermore developer answers some questions from a forum user,\nincluding how much money they\u2019ve made from ransomware\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting at this juncture that some junk-gun ransomware may well be a\nscam. We\u2019ve previously reported on criminals defrauding and hacking each other\nin a variety of ways on marketplaces \u2013 including \u2018rip and run\u2019 scams and\nbackdoored malware \u2013 and it\u2019s entirely possible that some of the variants we\ndiscuss here are schemes in this vein. We only found one allegation of this\nnature, however.\n\nFigure 10: A screenshot of an unnamed junk-gun ransomware, posted to a forum\nas part of a listing. Despite the window title of \u201cRansomware-As-A-Service\u201d,\nwe didn\u2019t observe any indication of any common RaaS-type revenue models or\nfeatures with this product, and it was offered at a standalone price of $200\n\nFigure 11: A user alleges that this ransomware is a scam and that they were\ndefrauded to the tune of $149 USDT (Tether)\n\nHowever, even affiliates of prominent ransomware families, operating under\ncommon RaaS models, run the risk of being scammed by RaaS operators.\nStandalone junk-gun ransomware may therefore be the lesser of two evils in the\nminds of some less-experienced threat actors, as it can provide them with more\nindependence and control.\n\n## Languages\n\n12 of the 19 adverts included details about the development language and/or\nframework, either in the initial post or in subsequent discussions.\nInterestingly, .NET/C# was the most popular (five variants), with C++\naccounting for three, two in C, and Python and Go one each.\n\nFigure 12: A user solicits development advice for an ongoing ransomware\nproject written in Go. Note the aspiration to make the ransomware \u201csimilar to\nthe APT Players such as BlackCat, PLAY, Black Basta\u201d\n\nFigure 13: Most junk-gun ransomware we observed, however, appeared to have\nbeen written in C#/.NET\n\nThis would seem to be at odds with \u2018traditional\u2019 malware and ransomware (often\nwritten in C or C++), and more modern strains (several ransomware families,\nincluding BlackCat and Hive, shifted to Rust and Go). It\u2019s not entirely\nsurprising, however; C# and .NET tend to have a shallower learning curve than\nmany programming languages and frameworks, and may therefore be more\nattractive to less experienced developers.\n\nPerhaps in keeping with this, virtually all the junk-gun ransomware we saw \u2013\nwith the exception of Evil Extractor \u2013 lacked the slick graphics and branding\nassociated with more prominent ransomware. In the majority of cases, logos and\ninterfaces were crude and amateurish (and some varieties were deliberately\nunbranded and unnamed, and so had no logos at all).\n\nFigure 14: The Lolicrypt logo\n\n## Features\n\nThe advertised capabilities of junk-gun ransomware varied widely. We observed\na range of cited encryption methods, although AES-256 and/or RSA-2048 were,\nunsurprisingly given their ubiquity, the most popular, appearing in seven of\nthe ten listings in which threat actors provided this detail. However, we also\nsaw some relatively rare algorithms, including Chacha20, XTEA, and Salsa20.\n\nFigure 15: A promotional post for Loni, referring to the use of the XTEA\ncipher. Loni was notable for the amount of technical information provided\nabout its features\n\nFour varieties (Evil Extractor; CatLogs; Nevermore; and RansomTuga) bundled\nother capabilities, such as infostealing and/or keylogging, along with\nransomware functionality. With regards to ransomware-related features, only\nthree varieties referred to deletion of volume shadow copies (a well-known\nransomware tactic), which was somewhat surprising \u2013 although six mentioned\nmulti-threaded encryption (another very common tactic, which increases the\nspeed of encryption).\n\nFigure 16: A post advertising the CatLogs junk-gun ransomware, which bundles\nmultiple other features\n\nOnly one variety, Kryptina, was described as specifically targeting Linux\noperating systems, although both the Lolicrypt and Loni developers stated that\nthey had introduced cross-platform capabilities or Linux-specific variants.\n\nFigure 17: The Lolicrypt developer claims that their ransomware has cross-\nplatform capabilities\n\nGoing against the grain, only Loni claimed to have remote encryption\ncapabilities. This perhaps illustrates how low-quality and crude most junk-gun\nransomware is, being limited to local encryption, whereas many major\nransomware families are capable of remote encryption.\n\nJust two adverts (an unnamed variety, and Evil Extractor) mentioned any kind\nof anti-VM or anti-debugger features.\n\nFigure 18: A feature list for an unnamed junk-gun ransomware includes\nreferences to \u201cAnti Virtual Machine\u201d and \u201cAnti Debugger\u201d capabilities\n\nWe did note that some junk-gun ransomware developers appear to have ambitions\nto eventually evolve their projects into more complex offerings. The Loni\ndeveloper, for example, argued that their ransomware is superior to RaaS\nschemes because there\u2019s no need to profit-share, pay affiliate joining fees,\nor run the risk of RaaS operators interfering with negotiations and payments.\n\nFigure 19: The Loni developer makes an argument for their product versus RaaS\nschemes. Note the reference to RaaS operators scamming affiliates, which we\nalluded to earlier\n\nHowever, the developer later mentioned that when they have collected enough\nfunds, they will \u201cscale up infrastructure and launch a data leak site\u201d \u2013\nthereby creating a sort of hybrid of a conventional RaaS infrastructure and\njunk-gun ransomware.\n\nFigure 20: The Loni developer reveals ambitions to later launch a data leak\nsite, as well as promising buyers \u201csupport and...new features\u201d\n\nWe also saw an advert which appeared to mimic some of the \u2018affiliate rules\u2019\nstipulated by prominent ransomware families. In one post, for an unnamed junk-\ngun ransomware, the developer listed \u201cforbidden targets\u201d, including hospitals\nand governments. However, this advert appeared to be for standalone\nransomware, so it\u2019s unclear how these rules would be enforced.\n\nFigure 21: A junk-gun ransomware advert specifies \u201cforbidden targets\u201d\n\n## In the wild?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to assess the extent to which most junk-gun ransomware has been\nused in real-world attacks. One of its major selling points is that little or\nno supporting infrastructure is required, and this includes leak sites \u2013 so\nthere is no central source of information for researchers and investigators to\nmonitor. Moreover, if buyers are targeting small businesses and individuals,\nsuch incidents are unlikely to be publicized to the same extent as those\ninvolving higher-profile organizations.\n\nThreat actors are also unlikely to discuss attacks on \u2018public\u2019 forums,\nparticularly if they were directly involved in those attacks. And it\u2019s\ndifficult to obtain technical information, such as hashes and other IOCs,\nwithout either purchasing the ransomware or investigating known incidents \u2013 so\nit\u2019s hard to determine if we\u2019ve seen any of these varieties before, under\ndifferent names or identities.\n\nHowever, we do know that threat actors have used Evil Extractor \u2013 to our\nknowledge, the only example that has received any in-depth coverage \u2013 in real-\nworld attacks. We also observed claims \u2013 two from sellers, one from a buyer \u2013\nthat three variants (Ergon, Loni, and Lolicrypt) have been used in the wild,\nbut we were unable to obtain any further information.\n\nFigure 22: A Lolicrypt buyer claims that they have \u201cbeen using it for a bit,\nworks as advertised\u201d\n\nFigure 23: The Loni developer states that Loni \u201chas been tested in real-world\nattacks\u201d\n\n## Detections\n\nWhen threat actors advertise malware on criminal forums, they often include\ndetection rates from online scanners, either in the form of a number or a\nscreenshot. While these results are almost always related to static, rather\nthan dynamic, detections, the criminal community often regards them as\nsomething of a quality benchmark. Threat actors may use a zero-detection rate\n(popularly known as \u2018FUD\u2019: \u2018fully undetected\u2019 or \u2018fully undetectable\u2019), for\nexample, as a selling point, even if that figure doesn\u2019t necessarily mean much\nin the context of real-world attacks.\n\nSix of the 19 adverts referred to some form of detection \u2013 three mentioning\nWindows Defender specifically (either in the context of detections or\nbypasses), and three referring to detections by multiple security products in\nonline scanners.\n\nFigure 24: The Yasmha developer responds to criticism of their initial advert\nby including details about the language and detection rate\n\nHowever, as we noted earlier, even a relatively high detection rate isn\u2019t\nnecessarily a dealbreaker when it comes to junk-gun ransomware. Small\nbusinesses and individuals may not always have security products, or may not\nhave configured them correctly, or may not adopt best practice when an alert\nis triggered \u2013 and many threat actors know this.\n\nFigure 25: A user claims to be targeting \u201c5-6 companies with no IT security at\nall\u201d\n\n# Known ransomware and RaaS schemes\n\nIn addition to relatively unknown junk-gun ransomware, we also found better-\nknown ransomware on the forums, albeit all relatively new or lower-tier\nfamilies. We grouped these examples into three categories: builders or source\ncode for sale or distribution; recruitment opportunities; and requests for\nassistance with development.\n\nName| Date posted| Type| Price  \n---|---|---|---  \nInsane| January 2024| Development request / affiliate recruitment| N/A  \nDJVU| January 2024| Builder for sale| Unknown  \nZeppelin| January 2024| Source code| Unknown  \nEndurance| November 2023| Affiliate recruitment / builder for sale| $850  \nChaos| June 2023| Builder for sale| Unknown  \nQilin| September 2023| Affiliate recruitment| N/A  \nqBit| September 2023| Builder for sale / development request| Unknown,\nreleased for free December 2023  \nBlack Snake| June 2023| Affiliate recruitment| N/A  \nHakuna Matata| July 2023| Builder for sale/distribution| Unknown  \nLMAO| June 2023| Builder for sale/distribution| Unknown  \nUnknown| July 2023| Affiliate recruitment| N/A  \n  \nTable 2: Known ransomware on the four criminal forums we investigated\n\nNote that we include \u2018yasmha\u2019 in the junk-gun ransomware section, rather than\nthis one, because the poster explicitly stated that it is a variant of Yashma\nransomware (the spelling mistake appears to be deliberate, or at least\nconsistent across multiple posts). Conversely, the threat actors offering\nbuilders and source code for DJVU (a variant of STOP), Zeppelin, Endurance,\nChaos (the predecessor to Yashma), qBit, Hakuna Matata, and LMAO (a variant of\nChaos) did not state that their products are novel, customized variants.\n\nFigure 26: An advert for DJVU ransomware on a criminal forum\n\nFigure 27: A screenshot of the Hakuna Matata ransomware builder, which was\noffered for sale/distribution on a forum\n\nFigure 28: A promotional post for Insane ransomware, including a request for\ndevelopment assistance\n\nFigure 29: Insane\u2019s leak site, with a notably garish old-school aesthetic\n\nFigure 30: A recruitment advert by the Qilin ransomware gang. Note the use of\nthe term \u201cpentesters\u201d, which threat actors often use as a euphemism for\naffiliates and/or IABs on criminal forums\n\nFinally, we also observed a recruitment campaign by an as-yet-unknown\nransomware family, TrapTight.\n\nFigure 31: A recruitment campaign by a new \u2018start-up\u2019 ransomware family,\nTrapTight\n\nAnd another by an unnamed ransomware gang:\n\nFigure 32: An unnamed ransomware family seeks \u201cpentesters\u201d to target\n\u201cmedium/big corporation\u201d [sic]\n\nThreat actors on lower-tier criminal forums therefore seem to have a few\noptions when it comes to getting involved in ransomware. The cheapest, most\ncommon, and most straightforward route appears to be the \u2018self-starter\u2019\napproach: purchasing junk-gun ransomware for a one-off price, and deploying it\nas they see fit. Alternatively, threat actors could purchase a builder for a\nbetter-known ransomware variant \u2013 something that has been tried and tested\nalready in real-world attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, if a threat actor is looking to develop ransomware\nthemselves, or to join an affiliate scheme, but is not skilled or experienced\nenough to apply to the big leagues, they can seek employment with known\nsecondary ransomware families, possibly as a precursor to joining better-known\nschemes. Or, if that\u2019s too much of a stretch, they could apply to join a\nbrand-new family like TrapTight.\n\n# Intentions, tutorials, and targets\n\nWhile it\u2019s often difficult to ascertain if threat actors have used junk-gun\nransomware in the wild, it is clear that some have ambitions to do so. For\ninstance, one individual claimed to have bought the Nevermore builder, and was\nlooking to \u201cransom any computer/server with important files either owned by\ncompanies or individuals.\u201d The threat actor went on to say that they were\nconsidering looking on Shodan \u2013 a search engine which indexes service banners,\nallowing users to find specified kinds of devices and services \u2013 to identify\nvulnerable RDP and SSH servers, an approach similar to that an IAB might take.\n\nFigure 33: A user seeks to spread the Nevermore ransomware\n\nThis interest in target selection is something we saw elsewhere, too; one user\nsought advice on how to identify \u201ca suitable target...I\u2019ve considered\nhighschools [sic] / universities\u201d and asked for tips on \u201cpossible targets, in\nterms of possible gain, lack of backups, chance of foothold.\u201d\n\nFigure 34: A forum user asks for tips on identifying targets\n\nAnother user said that they had already compromised a network, but had \u201cnever\ndeployed a ransomware [sic] before\u201d and asked other forum users for advice or\na \u201ctutorial.\u201d\n\nFigure 35: After compromising a network, a user confesses that they don\u2019t know\nhow to deploy ransomware\n\nA user on another forum had a similar issue:\n\nFigure 36: A user claims to have access to a company, but asks for assistance\non distributing ransomware\n\nFigure 37: A user (who claims to be relatively knowledgeable) asks for help on\nhow to \u201cinfect people with my ransomware\u201d\n\nOn the subject of guidance, we observed multiple users requesting and sharing\ncopies of so-called \u201cransomware manuals\u201d, including guides written by\nBassterlord, a prominent ransomware operator and IAB, and the \u201cConti manuals\u201d,\nleaked in 2021. Evidently, such users are seeking to learn from, and emulate,\nprominent ransomware actors.\n\nFigure 38: A user shares a copy of one of Bassterlord\u2019s manuals\n\nFigure 39: A user confesses to being \u201cconfused\u201d about how to configure\nransomware and asks for a manual\n\nIn other cases, users created and shared their own guides:\n\nFigure 40: A user shares their own guide on developing and spreading\nransomware\n\nSome users explicitly advocated targeting small businesses and individuals,\nand sought tips on how to contact them after ransomware deployment; how much\nmoney to ask for and in what cryptocurrency; and how to launder the proceeds.\n\nFigure 41: A user seeks advice on how to target small businesses\n\nAnother user, in response to a peer contending that \u201cnormal computer users\u201d\nwould not pay ransoms, argued: \u201cI believe it is reverse [sic]...big techs wont\n[sic] pay...but some normies do.\u201d\n\nFigure 42: As part of a spirited debate on a criminal forum, a user argues\nthat \u201cbig techs wont [sic] pay...but some normies do\u201d\n\nOne ransomware developer took a more aggressive approach. In their advert,\nthey noted that \u201cthere is no decryption key...once payment is made block the\nperson.\u201d They go on to say that this ransomware is \u201cdesigned...to target\nspecific people such as Scammers, Low Life\u2019s [sic], etc...\u201d\n\nFigure 43: A junk-gun ransomware developer notes that their product includes\nno possibility of decryption \u2013 in other words, victims can pay, but will not\nbe able to recover their files\n\nIn another particularly interesting post, the developer behind Nevermore\nsuggested an alternative approach to orthodox infection strategies: physical\naccess. They advocated putting ransomware on a USB stick; obtaining access to\na device (\u201cit could be that annoying neighbor or someone that you work for\u201d);\nturning off any security products; and then executing the ransomware. \u201cAs long\nas you avoid witnesses and cameras\u201d, the threat actor went on to say, \u201cthere\nis no [sic] much evidence to be used against you.\u201d\n\nFigure 44: The Nevermore developer suggests combining physical access with\nransomware for \u201ceasy money\u201d\n\nA user commented that this approach \u201cwould be valid only on small corps, [too\nrisky] to try it on any medium sized company\u201d, and suggested combining this\ntactic with social engineering to gain access to premises.\n\nThe Nevermore developer agreed, adding that \u201cyou would be surprised with [sic]\nthe number of people that leave their laptop/pc alone and unlocked and go to\nthe bathroom.\u201d\n\nFigure 45: Forum users discuss possible approaches for \u2018physical access\nransomware\u2019\n\n# Aspirations\n\nWhile the forums we investigated for this research are frequented by lower-\ntier threat actors, we observed an interesting nuance. Below the buyers and\nsellers of junk-gun ransomware, there is an even lower tier \u2013 those who are\nstill not yet at the stage of developing their own ransomware, but aspire to\ndo so.\n\nWe noted several instances of users soliciting tips on which languages to use,\nor people who had begun coding ransomware projects but, as in one of the\nexamples below, were \u201cconfused about what to do next.\u201d\n\nFigure 46: A user seeks advice on \u201cthe most suitable language\u201d for developing\nransomware\n\nFigure 47: A user wonders if writing ransomware in Java is worthwhile\n\nFigure 48: Users debate the relative merits of writing ransomware in C#.\nInterestingly, we also observed some users advising others to use Python,\nalthough the reception to that suggestion was mixed\n\nFigure 49: A user asks for help with developing their \u201cRaaS panel\u201d\n\nIn a few instances we also saw users who had an idea for different projects,\nbut weren\u2019t sure if they were feasible.\n\nFigure 50: A user solicits opinions on worm-based ransomware\n\nIn other cases, users who had presumably overcome these hurdles to create\nworking code were still at a loss as to the next stage. These users asked for\nadvice on how to licence their malware, how much to sell it for \u2013 and even how\nto sell it in the first place.\n\nFigure 51: A user asks for help in understanding how malware licencing works.\nOne response, interestingly, draws parallels with prominent tech firms\n\nFigure 52: A user wonders \u201chow to set a price for...malware\u201d\n\nFigure 53: This user was confused about how to start selling their malware,\nlet alone set a price or figure out a licencing model\n\n# Tracking tiers\n\nWhile it\u2019s no surprise that there are \u2018script kiddies\u2019 on criminal forums,\nthis sub-tier of would-be ransomware actors is still noteworthy. On higher-\nprofile, Russian-language cybercrime forums \u2013 those frequented by prominent\nand prolific IABs, malware developers, and ransomware affiliates \u2013 the\nquestions shown above would be at best ignored, and at worst ridiculed. (And\nmight, of course, fall foul of the ban on commercial ransomware posts on some\nmajor forums following the 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack \u2013 although many users\nhave circumvented the ban, and the extent to which it is observed and enforced\nappears to vary).\n\nBut on the forums we\u2019ve discussed here, users are less apprehensive about\nrevealing their ignorance, because those sites cater almost exclusively to\nless-skilled threat actors. There\u2019s a tacit understanding that these are not\ngatherings of the elite, or even of professionals, but are instead intended\nfor individuals who aspire to develop their abilities, to the point where they\ncan acquire a piece of the pie for themselves.\n\nWhile much criminal marketplace research focuses, not unreasonably, on higher-\ntier Russian-language sites (a topic for another article, but Russian \u2013\nspecifically fenya \u2013 is arguably the prestige language in the cybercrime\nunderground), there\u2019s also a benefit to monitoring lower-tier, English-\nlanguage forums. Sites like this may well produce the next generation of\nthreat actors. The relatively low-quality ideas and projects featured on them\nnow could evolve into more sophisticated threats over time, as threat actors\u2019\ncapabilities and confidence grow.\n\nThere\u2019s also an argument that lower-tier English-language forums may serve as\nthe first step of a career development path for some threat actors. The\ngraphic below illustrates the tiers we observed in our investigation, and how\na threat actor might advance through them. Users begin by asking basic\nquestions, and trying to code rudimentary ransomware and malware themselves.\nThey may then graduate to buying junk-gun ransomware, or developing, sharing,\nand selling it \u2013 perhaps, as we saw with Loni, with ambitions to eventually\nturn their projects into more complex schemes.\n\nFigure 54: An illustration of the various tiers of capability, ambition, and\npotential career development for ransomware actors\n\nAbove that tier are recruitment and development opportunities with emerging\nand secondary ransomware families \u2013 which have organized RaaS schemes; tried-\nand-tested malware; pre-existing infrastructure; and a proven track record of\nreal-world attacks. And then, at the apex, are the prominent, household-name\nransomware groups \u2013 the tier to which threat actors can aspire once they\u2019ve\npaid their dues, gained experience, and made a name for themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore important to view junk-gun ransomware not just as an\ninteresting phenomenon in and of itself, but as a component of the wider\nransomware ecosystem, and as a potential route to bigger and better\nopportunities for its creators, buyers, and users. As such, it\u2019s worthwhile\ntracking junk-gun ransomware and the individuals involved with it. Not only do\nthey pose a threat to small businesses and individuals now, but as time goes\non, at least some of them will likely become increasingly capable of\ninflicting damage on a larger scale.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBecause junk-gun ransomware seems to be a nascent development, we\u2019ll be\nkeeping an eye on it. It may signal a move towards a further fracturing of the\nransomware market, and perhaps even impending market saturation. Or it may be\nthat ransomware continues to shift into several distinct tiers: high-profile\ngroups target high-profile organizations, while the \u2018scraps\u2019 \u2013 small\nbusinesses and individuals \u2013 are left for lower-tier threat actors. Those\nlower-tier actors, who are currently making and selling junk-gun ransomware,\nmay in time \u2018move up the ranks\u2019 and be recruited as developers or affiliates\nby larger, more professional outfits.\n\nTo some extent, junk-gun ransomware is likely also simply a reflection of\ncapitalism in action. Like any other market, supply will expand to meet\ndemand, and would-be profiteers will flock to whatever services and products\nare generating the most money \u2013 and carve out niches for themselves as they do\nso. While we focused on ransomware for this research, it\u2019s likely the same\nstory for infostealers, RATs, and cryptominers: lower-quality products and\nactors at the bottom of the pile, hoping to eventually filter through to the\ntop.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that junk-gun ransomware poses unique challenges to\nsmall businesses, the wider public, and the security community. We observed\nthreat actors explicitly referring to attacks against smaller companies and\nindividuals \u2013 even as they tried to determine which types of company to\ntarget, and how much ransom to demand \u2013 because such targets are typically\nless well-defended, less informed, and less prepared.\n\nMeanwhile, junk-gun ransomware presents the security industry with several\nproblems. It\u2019s difficult to obtain samples of junk-gun ransomware; to\ndetermine the extent to which it has been used in the wild; and to track new\nvariants. Threat actors will also sometimes adopt the \u2018brand names\u2019 of known\nransomware families, possibly to exploit their reputations \u2013 something which\ncan cause confusion amongst researchers. Crucially, there\u2019s also less threat\nintelligence about junk-gun ransomware, because the forums on which it\nproliferates are not always heavily monitored by researchers \u2013 resulting in an\nintelligence gap. Of course, both businesses and security researchers must\ndevote time and resources to tracking numerous threats, some higher priority\nthan others, and which vary according to risk profiles, sectors, geography,\nand other factors \u2013 so there\u2019s a balance to be struck.\n\nHowever, tracking junk-gun ransomware, and those who are, at least currently,\non the periphery of the ransomware ecosystem, can provide valuable insights\ninto both individual threats, and potential future trends in the wider threat\nlandscape. Monitoring specific ransomware variants can help to protect small\nbusinesses and individuals now, while tracking sellers, buyers, and\ncapabilities can provide insight into the development of threats and threat\nactors over time.\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on X\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n\nAbout the Author\n\n### Sophos X-Ops\n\n### Read Similar Articles\n\nMay 24, 2021\n\n## What to expect when you\u2019ve been hit with Avaddon ransomware\n\nMay 19, 2021\n\n## What\u2019s New in Sophos EDR 4.0\n\nMay 19, 2021\n\n## Sophos XDR: Driven by data\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nSubscribe to get the latest updates in your inbox.\n\nYou\u2019re now subscribed!\n\nCheck your email to confirm your subscription.\n\nChange Region\n\n  * Am\u00e9rica Latina\n  * Brasil\n  * Deutschland\n  * English\n  * France\n  * Iberia\n  * Italia\n  * Japan\n\nTerms Privacy\n\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookies\n\nLegal\n\n  * General\n  * Modern Slavery Statement\n  * Speak Out\n\n\u00a9 1997 - 2024 Sophos Ltd.
