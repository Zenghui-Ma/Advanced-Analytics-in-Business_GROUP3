This algae absorbed a\nbacterium called UCYN-A and formed a new organelle called a nitroplast. The\nblack arrow is pointing to the nitroplast. Tyler Coale\n\nSHARE\n\nEvolution is quite a wondrous and lengthy process, with some random bursts of\nactivity that are responsible for the diversity of life on our planet today.\nThese can happen on large scales like with the evolution of more efficient\nlimbs. They also occur at microscopic cellular level, such as when different\nparts of the cell were first formed.\n\nNow, a team of scientists have detected a sign of a major life event that has\nlikely not occurred for at least one billion years. They\u2019ve observed primary\nendosymbiosis\u2013two lifeforms merging into one organism. This incredibly rare\nevent occurred between a type of abundant marine algae and a bacterium was\nobserved in a lab setting. For perspective, plants first began to dot our\nplanet the last time this happened. The results are described in two papers\nrecently published in the journals Cell and Science.\n\n## Where the \u2018powerhouse of the cell\u2019 and chloroplasts come from\n\nPrimary endosymbiosis happens when one microbial organism engulfs another. It\nthen begins to use the swallowed organisms as an internal organ. The host\nprovides the organism\u2013now called an endosymbiont\u2013several benefits including\nnutrients, energy, and protection. When it can no longer survive on its own,\nthe engulfed endosymbiont becomes an organ for the host called an organelle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that organelles arise from these types of things,\u201d Tyler\nCoale, a co-author of the Cell study and a postdoctoral scholar at the\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz said in a statement. \u201cThe first time we\nthink it happened, it gave rise to all complex life.\u201d\n\nEndosymbiosis where the host life form becomes fundamental to another\norganism\u2019s function has only happened three known times. All of these\ninstances were a major breakthroughs for evolution, since merging with their\nhosts became fundamental for the endosymbionts very existence.\n\nThe first event was roughly 2.2 billion years ago. This is when a single-\ncelled organism called archaea swallowed up a bacterium that eventually became\nthe mitochondria. This specialized organelle is what every biology student\nlearns is the \u201cpowerhouse of the cell\u201d and its formation allowed for complex\norganisms to evolve.\n\n\u201cEverything more complicated than a bacterial cell owes its existence to that\nevent,\u201d said Coale. \u201cA billion years ago or so, it happened again with the\nchloroplast, and that gave us plants,\u201d Coale said.\n\nThis second event occurred when more advanced cells absorbed cyanobacteria.\nCyanobacteria can harvest energy from sunlight and they eventually become\norganelles called chloroplasts that can harvest energy from sunlight. The\nchloroplasts gave us another core principle of biology\u2013green plants that can\nmake food from the sun.\n\nWith this latest endosymbiosis event, it\u2019s possible that the algae is\nconverting nitrogen from the atmosphere into ammonia that it can use for other\ncellular processes. However, it needs the help of a bacterium.\n\n## A new organelle?\n\nIn the paper published in Cell, a team of scientists show that this process is\noccurring yet again. They looked at a species of algae called Braarudosphaera\nbigelowii. The algae engulfed a cyanobacterium gives it a bit of a plant\nsuperpower. It can \u201cfix\u201d nitrogen straight from the air and combine it with\nother elements to form more useful compounds. This is something that plants\nnormally can\u2019t do.\n\nNitrogen is a very important nutrient for life to exist and plants normally\nget it through mutual relationships with the bacteria that remain separate\nfrom the plant or algae. The team first thought that the B. bigelowii algae\nhad this kind of symbiotic relationship with a bacterium called UCYN-A. The\nrelationship had actually gotten much more close and serious.\n\n[Related: You have no idea how much you need these bacteria.]\n\nThey found that the size ratio between the algae and UCYN-A bacterium remains\nsimilar across different species related to the B. bigelowii algae. The growth\nappears to be controlled by an exchange of key nutrients, linking up their\nmetabolisms. This synchronization of growth rates led the researchers to call\nUCYN-A organelle-like.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happens with organelles,\u201d study co-author and UC Santa\nCruz microbial oceanographer Jonathan Zehr said in a statement. \u201cIf you look\nat the mitochondria and the chloroplast, it\u2019s the same thing: they scale with\nthe cell.\u201d\n\n## Introducing the nitroplast\n\nTo look for more lines of evidence that this bactrium is an organelle, they\nneeded to take a deeper look inside. The study published in the journal\nScience used advanced X-ray imaging to get a look at the interior of the\nliving B. bigelowii algae cells. It revealed that the replication and cell\ndivision was synchronized between both the host algae and the UCYN-A\nbacterium. It provided even more evidence of this organism merging process of\nprimary endosymbiosis at work.\n\n\u201cUntil this paper, there was still a question of is this still an\n\u2018endosymbiont\u2019, or has it become a true organelle?\u201d Carolyn Larabell, a study\nco-author and faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab\u2019s Biosciences Area and\nDirector of the National Center for X-Ray Tomography, said in a statement. \u201cWe\nshowed with X-ray imaging that the process of replication and division of the\nalgal host and endosymbiont is synchronized, which provided the first strong\nevidence.\u201d\n\nThese images, generated by soft X-ray tomography performed by Berkeley Lab\nscientists, show the algae at different stages of cell division. UCYN-A, the\nnitrogen-fixing entity now considered an organelle, is cyan; the algal nucleus\nis depicted in blue, mitochondria are green, and chloroplasts are lilac.\nCREDIT: Valentina Loconte/Berkeley Lab\n\nThey also compared the proteins of isolated UCYN-A bacteria to the proteins\ninside of the algae cells. The team found that the isolated bacterium can only\nmake roughly half of the proteins it needs. It needs its algal host to provide\nit with the rest of the proteins necessary for living.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the hallmarks of something moving from an endosymbiont to an\norganelle,\u201d said Zehr. \u201cThey start throwing away pieces of DNA, and their\ngenomes get smaller and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell\nfor those gene products\u2013or the protein itself\u2013to be transported into the\ncell.\u201d\n\nThe team believes that this indicates that UCYN-A can be considered a full\norganelle. They gave it the name \u201cnitroplast,\u201d and it potentially began to\nevolve around 100 million years ago. While that sounds long to our human sense\nof time, it\u2019s a mere millisecond in evolutionary time when compared with\nmitochondria and chloroplasts.\n\nPlenty of other questions about UCYN-A and its algal host remain unanswered\nand the team also plans to figure out UCYN-A and the alga operate and study\ndifferent strains. Further study of nitroplasts could also determine if they\nare present in other cells and what their benefits may be. For example, it\ncould have wide applications in agriculture.\n\n\u201cThis system is a new perspective on nitrogen fixation, and it might provide\nclues into how such an organelle could be engineered into crop plants,\u201d said\nCoale.\n\nAccording to Zehr, scientists will likely find other organisms that have\nsimilar evolutionary stories as UCYN-A, but this discovery is \u201cone for the\ntextbooks.\u201d\n\nLaura Baisas\n\nLaura is a science news writer, covering a wide variety of subjects, but she\nis particularly fascinated by all things aquatic, paleontology,\nnanotechnology, and exploring how science influences daily life.
