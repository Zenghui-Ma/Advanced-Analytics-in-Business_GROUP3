After being drenched by a sudden rainstorm while out riding,\nthe poet developed a fever, from which he might well have recovered had it not\nbeen for some disastrous medical treatment, chiefly bleeding with leeches that\nleft him weak and dehydrated. He was just 36.\n\nExcept for Napoleon, Byron could have legitimately claimed to be the most\nfamous person of his time, partly because he\u2019d been branded \u2014 by the\ninfatuated (and married) Caroline Lamb \u2014 as \u201cmad, bad, and dangerous to know.\u201d\nNot only a major poet, especially in his mock epic \u201cDon Juan,\u201d he was also one\nof the half-dozen best letter writers in English. On the 200th anniversary of\nhis death, two excellent new books reveal this Romantic heartthrob, rebel and\nwanderer from fresh angles: Andrew Stauffer\u2019s \u201cByron: A Life in Ten Letters\u201d\nand \u201cByron\u2019s Travels: Poems, Letters, and Journals,\u201d compiled by Fiona\nStafford.\n\nStauffer, president of the Byron Society of America and a professor at the\nUniversity of Virginia, has essentially produced a concise biography of the\npoet by reprinting, explaining and adding context to 10 of his best letters.\nIn this way, we hear Byron\u2019s rapid-fire conversational voice on the page as he\nspills out his thoughts and relates his latest misadventures to his mother,\nlovers or friends. To each letter, Stauffer then appends an engaging, fact-\nrich essay, augmented by relevant quotations from Byron\u2019s poetry and\ninsightful comments of his own. Further enhancing the book\u2019s attractiveness,\nCambridge University Press has produced a physically elegant volume, one\nyou\u2019ll enjoy holding as well as reading.\n\nByron was born in 1788 with a slightly deformed foot, about which he remained\nsensitive his whole life. His birth name was George Gordon, but following the\ndeaths of two relatives, he suddenly inherited a title and a new name,\nconsiderable wealth, and a dilapidated medieval pile called Newstead Abbey.\nThere, he would throw orgiastic, mildly sacrilegious parties with his\nclassmates from Harrow and Cambridge, who would dress as monks and call their\nhost the Abbot. For three years, Byron then toured the Mediterranean and the\nNear East, sampling the local wines and other delicacies \u2014 including pretty\ngirls and, it now seems established, handsome boys. Out of these experiences\nemerged the first two semi-autobiographical cantos of \u201cChilde Harold\u2019s\nPilgrimage.\u201d They took London by storm in 1812. As their author later\nrecalled, \u201cI awoke one morning and found myself famous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCelebrity naturally led to invitations from the chicest London hostesses, and\nthe charismatic Byron soon became the cynosure of many female eyes. But, as he\nonce wrote, \u201cAlas! the love of women.\u201d While he sometimes initiated a\nseduction, just as often he was the one pursued, as in the case of Lamb, who\nonce dressed as a pageboy to sneak into Byron\u2019s bedroom. In looking back over\nhis love life, the poet only half-facetiously insisted, \u201cI have been more\nravished myself than anybody since the Trojan War.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Augusta Leigh, the woman he came to love most deeply, wasn\u2019t\njust married, she was also his-half sister. In the Romantic era, sisters often\ntook on an erotic charge, being viewed as the spiritual complements or mirrors\nof their unhappy brothers. Besides, as Byron\u2019s friend Shelley observed,\n\u201cIncest, like many other incorrect things, is a very poetical circumstance.\u201d\nIn Byron\u2019s dramatic poem, \u201cManfred,\u201d the Faustian protagonist suffers from the\nmemory of the dead sister he adored. Leigh\u2019s daughter, Medora, was almost\ncertainly fathered by Byron.\n\nIn an attempt to settle down, the poet married Annabella Milbanke, but their\nrelationship, while affectionate at first, quickly deteriorated. Milbanke\neventually separated from the abusive Byron but did give birth to their\ndaughter, Ada, who would become the mathematician Ada Lovelace, a pioneer in\nthe development of the computer or, as she and Charles Babbage called it, \u201cthe\nanalytical engine.\u201d\n\nByron\u2019s scandalous affairs and defiant flouting of hypocritical conventions \u2014\n\u201cI was born for opposition\u201d \u2014 soon led to his becoming a social outcast, and\nhe left Britain for good in 1816. En route to Italy, he passed a summer on\nLake Geneva at the Villa Diodati in the company of his doctor, William\nPolidori, and the irregular couple Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Godwin\nShelley, as well as Mary\u2019s stepsister, Claire Clairmont, already pregnant with\nByron\u2019s child. One stormy night, it was proposed that they all \u2014 Clairmont\nexcepted \u2014 write ghost stories. The poets only scribbled fragments before\ngiving up, but Polidori produced \u201cThe Vampyre\u201d \u2014 a novella that reimagined a\ntraditional folk-monster as a Byron look-alike, the suavely aristocratic Lord\nRuthven \u2014 and Mary Shelley began work on the most influential of all Gothic\nnovels, \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d In due course, Clairmont gave birth to the blue-eyed\nAllegra, who would succumb to a fever at age 5.\n\nBy then, the restless poet had moved to Italy, where after two wildly\npromiscuous years in Venice \u2014 the city of \u201cvile assignations, and adulterous\nbeds,/ Elopements, broken vows, and hearts, and heads\u201d \u2014 he settled into\nrelative domesticity in Ravenna and Genoa with Teresa Guiccioli, his \u201clast\nattachment.\u201d Following two relatively happy years as her as her cavalier\nservente, Byron decided to lend his personal and financial support to the\nGreek fight for independence. All too soon he would be dead, leaving behind\nbrokenhearted friends and lovers but also a new literary archetype: the proud,\nmoodily introspective and sexually magnetic Byronic hero, half Apollo, half\nSatan. Examples range from Alexandre Dumas\u2019s dark avenger, the Count of Monte\nCristo, and Emily Bronte\u2019s tempestuous Heathcliff to the myriad bad boys and\nbrooding heroes of modern romance novels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBesides women, travel, wine and dogs, Byron loved books and could readily\nquote ancient classics, Shakespeare and 18th-century literature. He also spoke\nfluent Italian and a smattering of other languages, including Armenian. Most\nimportantly, though, writing poetry allowed him to both re-experience and\nreflect on his multifaceted life and to critique contemporary mores. While his\nWeltschmerz-infused lyrics \u2014 \u201cShe walks in beauty like the night,\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019ll\ngo no more a-roving,\u201d \u201cMaid of Athens, ere we part\u201d \u2014 are anthology standards,\nhe truly excels at the satirical long poem, such as \u201cThe Vision of Judgment\u201d\n(it opens \u201cSaint Peter sat by the celestial gate:/ His keys were rusty, and\nthe lock was dull\u201d) and the endlessly entertaining \u201cDon Juan,\u201d the erotic\nadventures of its rather hapless Spanish hero, recounted by a jaded narrator\nwho insists, \u201cI sketch your world exactly as it goes.\u201d\n\nByron\u2019s style here isn\u2019t just sprightly, it\u2019s positively rollicking and\npeppered with epigrammatic phrases worthy of his poetic mentor, Alexander\nPope. That said, its presentation of women is cynical, to say the least.\nStill, there\u2019s no denying the Stephen Sondheim-like cleverness of Byron\u2019s\nrhymes: \u201cBut \u2014 oh ye lords of ladies intellectual!/ Inform us truly, have they\nnot henpecked you all?\u201d More reprehensible in its implications is perhaps his\nmost famous couplet, summarizing Juan\u2019s first seduction: \u201cA little still she\nstrove and much repented,/ And whispering, \u2018I will ne\u2019er consent\u2019 \u2014\nconsented.\u201d\n\nIn general, Byron\u2019s highly personal poetry is most effective when one knows\nsomething of his life \u2014 hence the value of Stauffer\u2019s book (and longer\nstandard biographies by Peter Quennell, Leslie Marchand and Fiona MacCarthy).\nHis letters bring us even closer to the man himself. Let me quote just one\nexample that captures his very self and voice. He is writing in 1817 to the\nIrish poet Thomas Moore about the third canto of \u201cChilde Harold\u201d:\n\n\u201cI am glad you like it; it is a fine indistinct piece of poetical desolation,\nand my favorite. I was half mad during the time of its composition, between\nmetaphysics, mountains, lakes, love unextinguishable, thoughts unutterable,\nand the nightmare of my own delinquencies. I should, many a good day, have\nblown my brains out, but for the recollection that it would have given\npleasure to my mother-in-law; and, even then, if I could have been certain to\nhaunt her ...\u201d\n\nWhile collections of the poet\u2019s work are plentiful, \u201cByron\u2019s Travels: Poems,\nLetters and Journals,\u201d edited by Oxford University professor Fiona Stafford,\nis unusual in its mosaic-like organization. Each section combines chronology\nand geography, tracking the itinerant poet\u2019s life by assembling his\nreflections on the places that shaped him, from his hot youth in England to\nhis early death at Missolonghi. As a result, Byron emerges as his own Boswell,\ntelling us, for example, that he grinds his teeth at night, but also sharing\nsuch melancholy observations as this one:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWhen one subtracts from life infancy (which is vegetation), \u2014 sleep, eating,\nand swilling \u2014 buttoning and unbuttoning \u2014 how much remains of downright\nexistence? The summer of a dormouse.\u201d\n\nIn England, Byron is being celebrated this year with scholarly conferences and\na commemorative service at Westminster Abbey. A statue of the poet will soon\nbe moved to a more prominent place in Hyde Park. Here in the United States, we\ncan at least read books like Stauffer\u2019s and Stafford\u2019s, and perhaps raise a\nglass in Byron\u2019s memory. If we happen to be drinking claret, I suspect that\none glass won\u2019t be enough.\n\n#####\n\nByron\n\nA Life in Ten Letters\n\nBy Andrew Stauffer\n\nCambridge University Press. 300 pp. $29.95\n\n#####\n\nByron\u2019s Travels\n\nPoems, Letters, and Journals\n\nSelected and Introduced by Fiona Stafford\n\nEveryman\u2019s Library. 728 pp. $35\n\n### More from Book World\n\nLove everything about books?
