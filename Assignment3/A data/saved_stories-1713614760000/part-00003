Davis\n\nAs someone formally diagnosed with schizophrenia who happens to be a\nprogrammer, I often get questions such as, \u201cWhat do you think of Terry A.\nDavis and his OS, TempleOS?\u201c While people who ask me this question often mean\nwell, it is often a catalyst for some complicated thoughts on mental illness\nand product development.\n\nI want to be delicate while also being realistic about Terry. He was, indeed,\na brilliant programmer. Where I disagree with him is in his insistence that\nthere was a grand conspiracy to hold back his operating system, perhaps\norchestrated by the CIA. Anyone who used his operating system could tell that\nit was, at the very least, unpolished. While it did have some recreational\nvalue, it did not provide a product that people could use that would enrich\ntheir lives.\n\nWhile I certainly can relate to Terry\u2019s sense of fleeting success, I do not\nascribe any agency or conspiracy as the cause of my failures, nor my lack of\nsuccesses. Any failures I have made in my life are strictly my own and, if\nnobody wants to read my posts or hire me to do a job, that is on me. Of\ncourse, I also disagree with Terry\u2019s use of racial and ethnic slurs. Let\u2019s be\nclear: schizophrenia does not cause racism. That failure was his own, as well.\n\nSo what is the take away from all this? First, that Terry was a complicated\nfigure, often brilliant, but certainly flawed. Second, that it is not my\nintention to present my lack of (current) success as anything other than the\nfailures (so far) to produce a useful product.\n\nWith that said, I wish to send regards to Terry\u2019s family and say a prayer that\nhe is now in a better place. May he find many successes in (if it exists) the\nafterlife. :)\n\n20/04/2024 powered by jorge\n\n", "frontpage": true}
