The stock gained as much as 45.3% this week, which is the best\nboost it\u2019s gotten in nearly a month, Marketwatch writes. DJT had its best day\nimmediately after it merged with a blank check company to become a publicly\ntraded company in March. However, since then, it has suffered a number of\ndownturns in value. CNN reports that it\u2019s currently down about 50 percent\nsince its all-time high last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTrump Media Stock Plummets After Truth Social Announces Live TV Streaming\nPlatform\n\nTrump Sues Truth Social Co-Founders\n\nTwitter Is Shifting Right | Future Tech\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nTwitter Is Shifting Right | Future Tech\n\nNow, the company has sent a letter to the head of Nasdaq, expressing concerns\nthat \u201cpotential market manipulation\u201d is impacting the stock. The letter, which\nwas sent on Thursday and made public Friday in an SEC filing, is written by\nDevin Nunes, the former Congressman and Trump presidential transition team\nmember who now serves as Trump Media\u2019s CEO. The letter from Nunes states:\n\n> I write to bring your attention to potential market manipulation of the\n> stock of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (\u201cTMTG\u201d), which operates the\n> Truth Social platform and has traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the\n> ticker \u201cDJT\u201d since March 26, 2024. As you know, \u201cnaked\u201d short\n> selling\u2014selling shares of a stock without first borrowing the shares of\n> stock deemed difficult to locate\u2014is generally illegal pursuant to Securities\n> and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Regulation SHO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC says naked short selling can hurt impacted companies. The letter notes\nthat, as of Wednesday, DJT had appeared on the Nasdaq\u2019s \u201cReg SHO threshold\nlist,\u201d which is \u201cindicative of unlawful trading activity.\u201d Such lists, which\nare a regulatory requirement, can be indicative \u201cof improper naked short\nselling,\u201d Investopedia claims.\n\nThe letter also claims that data \u201cmade available\u201d to the Trump Media and\nTechnology Group indicates that \u201cjust four market participants have been\nresponsible for over 60% of the extraordinary volume of DJT shares traded:\nCitadel Securities, VIRTU Americas, G1 Execution Services, and Jane Street\nCapital.\u201d Nunes\u2019s letter concludes that this is \u201cparticularly troubling given\nthat \u2018naked\u2019 short selling often entails sophisticated market participants\nprofiting at the expense of retail investors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to the claims, Citadel Securities brutally roasted Nunes in a\nstatement the firm has been circulating to the press. That statement, which\nthe company forwarded to Gizmodo, reads: \u201cDevin Nunes is the proverbial loser\nwho tries to blame \u2018naked short selling\u2019 for his falling stock price,\u201d the\nstatement reads. \u201cNunes is exactly the type of person Donald Trump would have\nfired on The Apprentice. If he [Nunes] worked for Citadel Securities, we would\nfire him, as ability and integrity are at the center of everything we do.\u201d\n\nOuch. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever read a corporate press release that reads more\nlike it was generated in a frat house. My condolences, Devin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Trump Media filed its complaint on Friday, the stock enjoyed another\nsmall bump, rising 12 percent and then settling back to a gain of 2 percent,\nMarketwatch reports.\n\nGizmodo reached out to TMTG, Virtu, Jane Street Capital, and Susquehanna\nInternational Group, which owns G1X, as well as the Nasdaq, for comment.
