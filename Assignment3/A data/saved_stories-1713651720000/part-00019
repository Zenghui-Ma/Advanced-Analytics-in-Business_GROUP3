But\nMichael Short, the Class of \u201942 Associate Professor of Nuclear Science and\nEngineering at MIT and associate director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion\nCenter (PSFC), is impatient with such talk. \u201cWe can say we should have only\nwind and solar someday. But we don\u2019t have the luxury of \u2018someday\u2019 anymore, so\nwe can\u2019t ignore other helpful ways to combat climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me,\nit\u2019s an \u2018all-hands-on-deck\u2019 thing. Solar and wind are clearly a big part of\nthe solution. But I think that nuclear power also has a critical role to\nplay.\u201d\n\nFor decades, researchers have been working on designs for both fission and\nfusion nuclear reactors using molten salts as fuels or coolants. While those\ndesigns promise significant safety and performance advantages, there\u2019s a\ncatch: Molten salt and the impurities within it often corrode metals,\nultimately causing them to crack, weaken, and fail. Inside a reactor, key\nmetal components will be exposed not only to molten salt but also\nsimultaneously to radiation, which generally has a detrimental effect on\nmaterials, making them more brittle and prone to failure. Will irradiation\nmake metal components inside a molten salt-cooled nuclear reactor corrode even\nmore quickly?\n\nShort and Weiyue Zhou PhD \u201921, a postdoc in the PSFC, have been investigating\nthat question for eight years. Their recent experimental findings show that\ncertain alloys will corrode more slowly when they\u2019re irradiated \u2014 and\nidentifying them among all the available commercial alloys can be\nstraightforward.\n\nThe first challenge \u2014 building a test facility\n\nWhen Short and Zhou began investigating the effect of radiation on corrosion,\npractically no reliable facilities existed to look at the two effects at once.\nThe standard approach was to examine such mechanisms in sequence: first\ncorrode, then irradiate, then examine the impact on the material. That\napproach greatly simplifies the task for the researchers, but with a major\ntrade-off. \u201cIn a reactor, everything is going to be happening at the same\ntime,\u201d says Short. \u201cIf you separate the two processes, you\u2019re not simulating a\nreactor; you\u2019re doing some other experiment that\u2019s not as relevant.\u201d\n\nSo, Short and Zhou took on the challenge of designing and building an\nexperimental setup that could do both at once. Short credits a team at the\nUniversity of Michigan for paving the way by designing a device that could\naccomplish that feat in water, rather than molten salts. Even so, Zhou notes,\nit took them three years to come up with a device that would work with molten\nsalts. Both researchers recall failure after failure, but the persistent Zhou\nultimately tried a totally new design, and it worked. Short adds that it also\ntook them three years to precisely replicate the salt mixture used by industry\n\u2014 another factor critical to getting a meaningful result. The hardest part was\nachieving and ensuring that the purity was correct by removing critical\nimpurities such as moisture, oxygen, and certain other metals.\n\nAs they were developing and testing their setup, Short and Zhou obtained\ninitial results showing that proton irradiation did not always accelerate\ncorrosion but sometimes actually decelerated it. They and others had\nhypothesized that possibility, but even so, they were surprised. \u201cWe thought\nwe must be doing something wrong,\u201d recalls Short. \u201cMaybe we mixed up the\nsamples or something.\u201d But they subsequently made similar observations for a\nvariety of conditions, increasing their confidence that their initial\nobservations were not outliers.\n\nThe successful setup\n\nCentral to their approach is the use of accelerated protons to mimic the\nimpact of the neutrons inside a nuclear reactor. Generating neutrons would be\nboth impractical and prohibitively expensive, and the neutrons would make\neverything highly radioactive, posing health risks and requiring very long\ntimes for an irradiated sample to cool down enough to be examined. Using\nprotons would enable Short and Zhou to examine radiation-altered corrosion\nboth rapidly and safely.\n\nKey to their experimental setup is a test chamber that they attach to a proton\naccelerator. To prepare the test chamber for an experiment, they place inside\nit a thin disc of the metal alloy being tested on top of a a pellet of salt.\nDuring the test, the entire foil disc is exposed to a bath of molten salt. At\nthe same time, a beam of protons bombards the sample from the side opposite\nthe salt pellet, but the proton beam is restricted to a circle in the middle\nof the foil sample. \u201cNo one can argue with our results then,\u201d says Short. \u201cIn\na single experiment, the whole sample is subjected to corrosion, and only a\ncircle in the center of the sample is simultaneously irradiated by protons. We\ncan see the curvature of the proton beam outline in our results, so we know\nwhich region is which.\u201d\n\nThe results with that arrangement were unchanged from the initial results.\nThey confirmed the researchers\u2019 preliminary findings, supporting their\ncontroversial hypothesis that rather than accelerating corrosion, radiation\nwould actually decelerate corrosion in some materials under some conditions.\nFortunately, they just happen to be the same conditions that will be\nexperienced by metals in molten salt-cooled reactors.\n\nWhy is that outcome controversial? A closeup look at the corrosion process\nwill explain. When salt corrodes metal, the salt finds atomic-level openings\nin the solid, seeps in, and dissolves salt-soluble atoms, pulling them out and\nleaving a gap in the material \u2014 a spot where the material is now weak.\n\u201cRadiation adds energy to atoms, causing them to be ballistically knocked out\nof their positions and move very fast,\u201d explains Short. So, it makes sense\nthat irradiating a material would cause atoms to move into the salt more\nquickly, increasing the rate of corrosion. Yet in some of their tests, the\nresearchers found the opposite to be true.\n\nExperiments with \u201cmodel\u201d alloys\n\nThe researchers\u2019 first experiments in their novel setup involved \u201cmodel\u201d\nalloys consisting of nickel and chromium, a simple combination that would give\nthem a first look at the corrosion process in action. In addition, they added\neuropium fluoride to the salt, a compound known to speed up corrosion. In our\neveryday world, we often think of corrosion as taking years or decades, but in\nthe more extreme conditions of a molten salt reactor it can noticeably occur\nin just hours. The researchers used the europium fluoride to speed up\ncorrosion even more without changing the corrosion process. This allowed for\nmore rapid determination of which materials, under which conditions,\nexperienced more or less corrosion with simultaneous proton irradiation.\n\nThe use of protons to emulate neutron damage to materials meant that the\nexperimental setup had to be carefully designed and the operating conditions\ncarefully selected and controlled. Protons are hydrogen atoms with an\nelectrical charge, and under some conditions the hydrogen could chemically\nreact with atoms in the sample foil, altering the corrosion response, or with\nions in the salt, making the salt more corrosive. Therefore, the proton beam\nhad to penetrate the foil sample but then stop in the salt as soon as\npossible. Under these conditions, the researchers found they could deliver a\nrelatively uniform dose of radiation inside the foil layer while also\nminimizing chemical reactions in both the foil and the salt.\n\nTests showed that a proton beam accelerated to 3 million electron-volts\ncombined with a foil sample between 25 and 30 microns thick would work well\nfor their nickel-chromium alloys. The temperature and duration of the exposure\ncould be adjusted based on the corrosion susceptibility of the specific\nmaterials being tested.\n\nOptical images of samples examined after tests with the model alloys showed a\nclear boundary between the area that was exposed only to the molten salt and\nthe area that was also exposed to the proton beam. Electron microscope images\nfocusing on that boundary showed that the area that had been exposed only to\nthe molten salt included dark patches where the molten salt had penetrated all\nthe way through the foil, while the area that had also been exposed to the\nproton beam showed almost no such dark patches.\n\nTo confirm that the dark patches were due to corrosion, the researchers cut\nthrough the foil sample to create cross sections. In them, they could see\ntunnels that the salt had dug into the sample. \u201cFor regions not under\nradiation, we see that the salt tunnels link the one side of the sample to the\nother side,\u201d says Zhou. \u201cFor regions under radiation, we see that the salt\ntunnels stop more or less halfway and rarely reach the other side. So we\nverified that they didn\u2019t penetrate the whole way.\u201d\n\nThe results \u201cexceeded our wildest expectations,\u201d says Short. \u201cIn every test we\nran, the application of radiation slowed corrosion by a factor of two to three\ntimes.\u201d\n\nMore experiments, more insights\n\nIn subsequent tests, the researchers more closely replicated commercially\navailable molten salt by omitting the additive (europium fluoride) that they\nhad used to speed up corrosion, and they tweaked the temperature for even more\nrealistic conditions. \u201cIn carefully monitored tests, we found that by raising\nthe temperature by 100 degrees Celsius, we could get corrosion to happen about\n1,000 times faster than it would in a reactor,\u201d says Short.\n\nImages from experiments with the nickel-chromium alloy plus the molten salt\nwithout the corrosive additive yielded further insights. Electron microscope\nimages of the side of the foil sample facing the molten salt showed that in\nsections only exposed to the molten salt, the corrosion is clearly focused on\nthe weakest part of the structure \u2014 the boundaries between the grains in the\nmetal. In sections that were exposed to both the molten salt and the proton\nbeam, the corrosion isn\u2019t limited to the grain boundaries but is more spread\nout over the surface. Experimental results showed that these cracks are\nshallower and less likely to cause a key component to break.\n\nShort explains the observations. Metals are made up of individual grains\ninside which atoms are lined up in an orderly fashion. Where the grains come\ntogether there are areas \u2014 called grain boundaries \u2014 where the atoms don\u2019t\nline up as well. In the corrosion-only images, dark lines track the grain\nboundaries. Molten salt has seeped into the grain boundaries and pulled out\nsalt-soluble atoms. In the corrosion-plus-irradiation images, the damage is\nmore general. It\u2019s not only the grain boundaries that get attacked but also\nregions within the grains.\n\nSo, when the material is irradiated, the molten salt also removes material\nfrom within the grains. Over time, more material comes out of the grains\nthemselves than from the spaces between them. The removal isn\u2019t focused on the\ngrain boundaries; it\u2019s spread out over the whole surface. As a result, any\ncracks that form are shallower and more spread out, and the material is less\nlikely to fail.\n\nTesting commercial alloys\n\nThe experiments described thus far involved model alloys \u2014 simple combinations\nof elements that are good for studying science but would never be used in a\nreactor. In the next series of experiments, the researchers focused on three\ncommercially available alloys that are composed of nickel, chromium, iron,\nmolybdenum, and other elements in various combinations.\n\nResults from the experiments with the commercial alloys showed a consistent\npattern \u2014 one that confirmed an idea that the researchers had going in: the\nhigher the concentration of salt-soluble elements in the alloy, the worse the\nradiation-induced corrosion damage. Radiation will increase the rate at which\nsalt-soluble atoms such as chromium leave the grain boundaries, hastening the\ncorrosion process. However, if there are more not-soluble elements such as\nnickel present, those atoms will go into the salt more slowly. Over time,\nthey\u2019ll accumulate at the grain boundary and form a protective coating that\nblocks the grain boundary \u2014 a \u201cself-healing mechanism that decelerates the\nrate of corrosion,\u201d say the researchers.\n\nThus, if an alloy consists mostly of atoms that don\u2019t dissolve in molten salt,\nirradiation will cause them to form a protective coating that slows the\ncorrosion process. But if an alloy consists mostly of atoms that dissolve in\nmolten salt, irradiation will make them dissolve faster, speeding up\ncorrosion. As Short summarizes, \u201cIn terms of corrosion, irradiation makes a\ngood alloy better and a bad alloy worse.\u201d\n\nReal-world relevance plus practical guidelines\n\nShort and Zhou find their results encouraging. In a nuclear reactor made of\n\u201cgood\u201d alloys, the slowdown in corrosion will probably be even more pronounced\nthan what they observed in their proton-based experiments because the neutrons\nthat inflict the damage won\u2019t chemically react with the salt to make it more\ncorrosive. As a result, reactor designers could push the envelope more in\ntheir operating conditions, allowing them to get more power out of the same\nnuclear plant without compromising on safety.\n\nHowever, the researchers stress that there\u2019s much work to be done. Many more\nprojects are needed to explore and understand the exact corrosion mechanism in\nspecific alloys under different irradiation conditions. In addition, their\nfindings need to be replicated by groups at other institutions using their own\nfacilities. \u201cWhat needs to happen now is for other labs to build their own\nfacilities and start verifying whether they get the same results as we did,\u201d\nsays Short. To that end, Short and Zhou have made the details of their\nexperimental setup and all of their data freely available online. \u201cWe\u2019ve also\nbeen actively communicating with researchers at other institutions who have\ncontacted us,\u201d adds Zhou. \u201cWhen they\u2019re planning to visit, we offer to show\nthem demonstration experiments while they\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nBut already their findings provide practical guidance for other researchers\nand equipment designers. For example, the standard way to quantify corrosion\ndamage is by \u201cmass loss,\u201d a measure of how much weight the material has lost.\nBut Short and Zhou consider mass loss a flawed measure of corrosion in molten\nsalts. \u201cIf you\u2019re a nuclear plant operator, you usually care whether your\nstructural components are going to break,\u201d says Short. \u201cOur experiments show\nthat radiation can change how deep the cracks are, when all other things are\nheld constant. The deeper the cracks, the more likely a structural component\nis to break, leading to a reactor failure.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the researchers offer a simple rule for identifying good metal\nalloys for structural components in molten salt reactors. Manufacturers\nprovide extensive lists of available alloys with different compositions,\nmicrostructures, and additives. Faced with a list of options for critical\nstructures, the designer of a new nuclear fission or fusion reactor can simply\nexamine the composition of each alloy being offered. The one with the highest\ncontent of corrosion-resistant elements such as nickel will be the best\nchoice. Inside a nuclear reactor, that alloy should respond to a bombardment\nof radiation not by corroding more rapidly but by forming a protective layer\nthat helps block the corrosion process. \u201cThat may seem like a trivial result,\nbut the exact threshold where radiation decelerates corrosion depends on the\nsalt chemistry, the density of neutrons in the reactor, their energies, and a\nfew other factors,\u201d says Short. \u201cTherefore, the complete guidelines are a bit\nmore complicated. But they\u2019re presented in a straightforward way that users\ncan understand and utilize to make a good choice for the molten salt\u2013based\nreactor they\u2019re designing.\u201d\n\nThis research was funded, in part, by Eni S.p.A. through the MIT Plasma\nScience and Fusion Center\u2019s Laboratory for Innovative Fusion Technologies.\nEarlier work was funded, in part, by the Transatomic Power Corporation and by\nthe U.S. Department of Energy Nuclear Energy University Program.
