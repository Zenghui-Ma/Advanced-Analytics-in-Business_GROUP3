Photograph: The Guardian\n\nLondon\n\n# Artist evicted by London landlord cuts rent by commuting from Argentina\n\nAndy Leek, creator of Notes to Strangers, made the move after finding himself\nunable to afford rising rents in UK capital\n\nRobert Booth Social affairs correspondent\n\nShare\n\nAn artist who was made homeless after being evicted by his private landlord in\nLondon has started effectively commuting from Argentina where the rent is so\nmuch cheaper that it covers the cost of air fare.\n\nAndy Leek, 38, whose Notes to Strangers works are pasted on to walls and\njunction boxes across more than 20 British and European cities, has moved to\nBuenos Aires where the rents are several times cheaper and he travels back to\nthe UK roughly every two months for work. The flight costs less than a monthly\ntrain season ticket between Bristol and London.\n\nHis move is an extreme, and carbon intensive, example of what happens when\npeople are priced out of the UK\u2019s rent hotspots, and comes as the average UK\nprivate rent increased by a record 9.2% in the last year (11.2% in London),\naccording to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics,\nreleased on Wednesday.\n\ngraphic\n\nIt is the highest annual increase since 2015, when the data series began and\nequivalent to an \u201ceye-watering\u201d \u00a32,500 rise in the average annual rent bill in\nLondon, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.\n\n\u201cI have so much love for London but I am so angry with it,\u201d said Leek, who\npastes up handwritten A4 notices with encouraging messages such as \u201cwrong\ndecisions still move you forward\u201d and \u201cI wish you would keep some of your\nkindness for yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people feel that way. The more the housing crisis completely\nhamstrings us, the more people are going to live in Glasgow, Manchester or\nfar-flung corners of the world.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the soaring cost of renting has driven more and more people\nout of the capital. New analysis for the Guardian by Hamptons, shows that in\nthe first three months of 2024, 36% of London renters who decided to move\nhouse left the capital, up from 27% in 2012. The number quitting the city in\nthe last year dropped slightly towards pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLeek, a former art director at an advertising agency, earns money by selling\nversions of his Notes to Strangers works, taking special commissions for\nbrands and public speaking. He paid \u00a31,000 a month for a flatshare in Brixton,\nbut had to sofa surf and sleep on floors after the landlord evicted him and he\ncould not afford London\u2019s rising rents, which are up 30% since 2015, the\nlatest ONS figures showed.\n\ngraphic\n\nIn Argentina, he is making a documentary about an emerging rock group, which\nfocuses in part on the even deeper cost of living crisis there, where extreme\ninflation means prices rose more than 50% in just the first three months of\nthis year.\n\nHe said he \u201cfeels kinship\u201d with the band, Los Titeres \u2013 which translates as\nthe Puppets \u2013 whose progress is being hindered by having to work day jobs and\nwho cannot afford to make high-quality recordings.\n\nHousing is many UK voters\u2019 priority but rental system remains unfixed\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cThis is an impossible situation when groceries double in price,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow are you meant to live? It\u2019s a heightened version [of what is happening in\nthe UK]. I went shopping with the lead singer and she was doing the maths [on\nthe prices] in her head. You walk around the supermarket and you feel pain.\u201d\n\nSince moving to Argentina Leek has paid as little as \u00a3400 a month rent for an\napartment and flown back to London four times saying: \u201cIt works out far\ncheaper than staying in London, dealing with the hassle and not getting by.\u201d\n\nHis relocation 7,000 miles away is far more extreme than most people who are\ndeciding to leave Britain\u2019s most expensive rent hotspots in London. Private\nrenters leaving the capital are now most likely to move to Epping in Essex,\nBroxbourne in Hertfordshire and Tonbridge and Malling in Kent, according to\nHamptons\u2019 research among its wider network of Countryside agencies. Other\npopular destinations for ex-London renters are Watford, Luton and Slough.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * London\n  * Renting property\n  * Property\n  * England\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Housing is many UK voters\u2019 priority but rental system remains unfixed\n\n1d ago\n\n  * ### Rental surge in rural areas putting pressure on English councils, warns report\n\n23 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### What are the proposals to restrict short-term lets in England?\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Private tenants in Scotland \u2018face big rent rises and mass evictions\u2019 from April\n\n11 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Renters in England face rising no-fault evictions as reform bill delayed again\n\n8 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Cost of private renting in UK rising faster than ever, says ONS\n\n20 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### UK renters offer tenant CVs and year\u2019s rent upfront to try to secure a home\n\n17 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### Cashing in?
