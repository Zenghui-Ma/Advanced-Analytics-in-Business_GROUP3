This includes female guardsmen as well as female Space Marines.\n\nBut neither makes much sense, and especially the latter. I will be discussing\nhere why female Space Marines do not make sense.\n\n# There already are female Space Marines\n\nFirst reason why female Space Marines do not make sense is that they already\nexist \u2013 and they are called Sisters of Battle. If somebody were to ask for\nmale Sisters of Battle (Brothers of Battle?), he would be rightly laughed at,\nbecause such a request makes no sense.\n\nSisters of Battle have literally everything that makes Space Marines different\nfrom Imperial Guardsmen:\n\n  1. Elite units? Check.\n  2. Superhuman physical abilities? Check.\n  3. Power armor? Check.\n\nNeither Space Marines nor Sisters of Battle have a direct counterpart of the\nopposite sex. Rather, they are each other\u2019s counterpart. In fact, the image\n(seen below) often shown to \u201cprove\u201d the existence of female Space Marines in\nearly lore are really the Sisters of Sin \u2013 the early-days precursor of the\nSisters of Battle.\n\nThis makes sense with the pseudo-Catholic inspirations of both. Space Marines\nare essentially space knights. And historical monastic knightly orders did not\nallow women to join for both practical (women make poor soldiers) and\nideological reasons. On the flip side, however, nuns are women who dedicate\ntheir life to religion. So where Space Marines are sci-fi knights, Sisters of\nBattle are sci-fi battle nuns. And it works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nThus, introducing female Space Marines would be a terrible move. They are\ncompletely unnecessary, and bringing them in would devalue the role and\nuniqueness of the Sisters of Battle. Instead of promoting equality, female\nSpace Marines would devalue female representation already existing in the\nsetting. Already, Space Marines are the only all-male army in the setting.\nOrks are single-sex species, Sisters of Battle are all-female, while Imperial\nGuard, Tau, Eldar and basically all other armies allow both men and women to\njoin. As it is, setting is perfectly balanced in terms of sex representation.\n\n# It makes no sense within the setting\n\nIn the lore, modifications for Space Marines are heavily dependant on body\u2019s\nnatural hormonal secretions and growth patterns:\n\nEnd result of genetic and other enhancements used to produce the Space Marine\ndepends heavily on the starting state. That is the reason why Space Marines\nonly accept the best of the best recruits as applicants. Women do not have the\ngenes and hormones necessary to become Space Marines, and Imperium does not\nhave the magic to turn women into men. Neither does the Imperium have the\nluxury to ignore reality and entertain delusions (as is common in many modern-\nday societies). And Space Marines are created from humans, not from intersex\ndemons, and should thus follow human biology, not somebody\u2019s Salvia and DMT-\nfueled dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nHaving this limitation is extremely significant for lore reasons. Imperium of\nMan is a civilization in decline \u2013 it is basically how people from Renaissance\nlooked at the Middle Ages, decrepit remains of a glorious past (in reality,\nRenaissance itself was that far more than actual Middle Ages were).\nIntroduction itself lays it out:\n\nForget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten,\nnever to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for\nin the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the\nstars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of\nthirsting gods.\n\nImperium having major technological limitations is a fundamental part of the\nsetting. And despite what some people claim, men and women have significant\nbiological (genetic, hormonal and physical) differences. Men are on average\nlarger than women. Even when they are of the same size, men will have greater\nmuscle mass as proportion of total mass. Male muscles themselves are generally\nfaster and have higher maximum power output than female muscles \u2013 which, by\nthe way, is the reason why trans athletes dominate female sports and why so\nmany failed male athletes are keen on transgender surgery to enter female\nsports. Existence of intersex people is not a justification \u2013 \u201ctrue intersex\u201d\nperson is one who cannot be classified as either male or female biologically,\nbut they account for only 0,018% of all births \u2013 one in 5,5 thousand. It is a\nbug, not a feature; nothing more than a mistake in the genetic code. And even\nif they accounted for 33% of all births and were thus normal, that would\nmerely mean there is a third sex, not that sexes / genders do not exist.\nClaiming that existence of intersex people validates the idea that\nsexes/genders don\u2019t exist is like claiming that existence of Sahara proves\nwater doesn\u2019t exist. Lack of testosterone in men will lead to depression,\nweight gain, cardiovascular and other health issues.\n\nIf Emperor of Man, greatest scientist in human history, couldn\u2019t make women\ninto Space Marines, then nobody else cannot.\n\nEven if we handwave away the canon explanation and make it so that women can\nin fact become Space Marines, recruiting women as Space Marines would still\nremain nonsensical due to simple logistics. In order to become Space Marines,\nrecruits have to:\n\n  1. Be born on a Chapter Recruitment World \u2013 which are selected because their populations already have superhuman abilities.\n  2. Prove that they are capable of surviving to adulthood in the extremely harsh conditions on the world (many are actual Death Worlds).\n  3. Fulfill harsh entrance requirements, which include surviving the extremely lethal selection process.\n  4. Survive the Space Marine recruit training.\n  5. Survive the genetic enhancement procedures.\n  6. Survive the post-enhancement training.\n\nAnd all of these steps are extremely harsh, because Space Marine enhancement\nprocedures depend on extremely rare (and in some cases non-renewable)\nresources which cannot be wasted on the unworthy. Claim that Imperium would\nprofit by doubling recruitment pool for Space Marines is nonsense, because\nvast majority if not entirety of the expansion would be worthless anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nBiological differences that men and women have mean that women are far less\nlikely to survive every single step of the above-noted selection process. Even\nif we assume a minor difference in average survival rate per step \u2013 say, 32%\nfor men and 28% for women \u2013 this would result in 1% of men and 0,6% of women\nsurviving to the end (calculation is number^4 as there are four steps beyond\nthe second one, and canon survival rate is 1% which results in 32% per step\nfor men). Essentially, 4% disadvantage in survival rate means that number of\nwomen making it to the end is barely more than half that of men.\n\nIn real world, USMC study from 1997 found the female discharge rate was 18.2\npercent and the male rate was 11.9 percent during 63 days of Marine Corp basic\ntraining at Parris Island. Medical discharge rate is 3,3 and 8,7 percent.\nUsing first difference for the above would result in survival rate per step of\n32% for male Space Marine recruits and 21% for female recruits. This would\nresult in survival rate of women in training being only around 1/6 that of men\n\u2013 specifically, 1% for men and 0,19% for women. Second data point would result\nin 32% survival per step for men and 12% for women. In the end, men would have\nsurvival rate of 1% and women of 0,0207% for women \u2013 that is, men would have\n48 times better survival rate than women.\n\nAnd even then women would likely not perform as well as men, unless\nmodifications were so extensive that they became men due to them. US Marine\nCorps study has shown that female marines \u2013 that is, women that had passed all\nphysical tests \u2013 still do not perform as well as men in combat. Modern-day\nspecial operations forces have between 0% and 0,1% of women in their ranks,\nand for a very good reason.\n\nAbove is based on the real world however. But one of main bottlenecks in Space\nMarine recruitment is the body modification \u2013 genetic modification and\ninstallation of organs. Every single surgery and modification has a\nsignificant chance of killing the neophyte. Geneseed in particular is meant to\nmake the recruit resemble the Primarch of the Chapter. And all Primarchs are\nmale, which means that \u2013 even if zygote could be made to accept a female body,\nwhich is impossible \u2013 a female recruit would in fact be at a significantly\ngreater chance of being rejected by the geneseed. And if she somehow made it\nthrough, process would change her so much that nobody would be able to tell\nthe difference any more.\n\nTherefore, it makes no sense for the Imperium to waste extreme effort of time\nand resources \u2013 including the single most valuable resource they have,\ngeneseed \u2013 in order to try and uphold some misguided 21^st century ideals.\nImperium is in a war for survival, now more than ever, and does what is\nnecessary to survive. For Imperium, following real-world current day politics\nwould be obviously insane.\n\nThe only logical explanation for female Space Marines would be a Chaos\nmutation bestowed by Slaanesh.\n\n# Nature of the Organization\n\nMoving from individuals to organization, Space Marines are in fact based on\nthe religious warrior orders such as Templars and Hospitallers. Black Templars\nchapter basically takes name of Knights Templar and heraldry of Knights\nHospitaller. Space Marine chapters are based on religious chapters,\nspecifically the general chapters. A general chapter is a general assembly of\nmonks, that is, representatives from an order or congregation. Similar\nknightly chapters also existed. And monastic knights such as Templars were\nall-male organizations which practiced sexual abstinence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nThis is what Space Marine chapters are. And religious orders tend to be unisex\nfor several very good reasons. Sexuality is a powerful force, and difficult to\ncontrol. Thus, discipline is made easier when entire group is of the same sex.\nAnd in universe where there are literal sex demons waiting to snack on\npeoples\u2019 souls, having control over one\u2019s sex drive is a very good idea.\n\n# It makes no sense for their purpose\n\nSpace Marines are superhuman. But they are not posthuman. Space Marines are\nintended to be protectors of humanity, not their replacement. For this reason,\nthey are not intended to breed. And since Space Marines are not castrated \u2013\nsee above as to why \u2013 then it is better to have only men be Space Marines, in\norder to add yet another safety level that would prevent them from breeding.\n\n# Postscriptum: Did they ever exist?\n\nWhen precursors to Space Marines were introduced in the First Edition, early\nCitadel ranges in fact had female Space Marines \u2013 intention was that upwards\nof 25% of all models would be female. Or at least that is the argument I had\nfound.\n\nBut this argument is false. It is true that the first edition had a lot of\nweird stuff \u2013 half-Eldar Space Marine commander, Leman Russ being a regular\nImperial Guard general, and so on. But the female Space Marines were never\ncanon.\n\nThe so-called \u201cfemale Space Marines\u201d noted above \u2013 Little Sisters of\nPurification \u2013 were concieved by Game Designers Workship for their challenge\nmagazine. This also happened during the Rogue Trader days, before the\nWarhammer 40k universe has actually solidified. Proper 40k only actually\nstarts from the 2^nd Edition, and has remained fairly consistent since then.\nAnd in any case, these \u201cfemale Space Marines\u201d were using same models as male\nMarines.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFemale Space Marines never existed, and never should exist. But push for the\nfemale Space Marines is not about logic, continuity, representation or\nanything else \u2013 after all, Sisters of Battle and Saints already exist. People\nwho want female Space Marines do not care about women. They do not care about\nthe Space Marines either, or about wargaming or Warhammer 40 000. They merely\nwant to take control of Warhammer 40.000 and turn it into something it never\nwas and never should be. The goal is to take what is popular and replace it\nwith a bucket of excretment, preventing anybody but them from enjoying the now\npoliticized hobby. All that maters is power and influence. And Space Marines,\nas the poster child of the franchise, are an obvious target. If Games Workshop\nsurrenders to the inane demand, it will not be long before Warhammer 40k\nitself is turned into vehicle of political propaganda \u2013 as has happened with\nRings of Power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nSpace Marines, being the poster boys, are the Rubicon of the franchise: if\nthey are taken over, the franchise falls. Surrender on this point will be used\nto justify further takeovers: \u201cYou have accepted A, so what is the problem\nwith accepting B?\u201d \u2013 and so on unto infinity. Step by step, the entire lore\nwill be rewritten and setting turned into inane pastiche with no soul \u2013 or\nworse, into My Little Pony. Old fans will leave it because it will no longer\nhave anything in common with the thing that they had fallen in love with, and\nnew \u201cfans\u201d will leave it in search of other fictional settings that they can\nruin. And all the while they will cry how \u201cit is just a game, why do you care\u201d\nwhile doing their best to destroy it.\n\nGood representation for women in the setting are Sisters of Battle and Sisters\nof Silence. And Sisters of Silence could be what Custodes are to the Space\nMarines. But this does not give room for ideological warfare, and thus\nactivists are not interested in it. They do not push it because neither of\nthese goes against the lore, it does not change the setting and does not give\nthe Left the power trip they need. Left wants to win against the community.\n\nIt is impossible for anything to be for everyone, and it is not worth it to\neven try. If one tries to make something that is for everybody, he will end up\nmaking something so shallow that it will be for nobody.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nSong Review \u2013 The Greatest Of Them All by Stringstorm9 Nov 2023In \"reviews\"\n\nHow Large is the Imperial Navy in Warhammer 40k17 Mar 2024In \"organization\"\n\nHow Numerous Is Imperial Guard in Warhammer 40k24 Mar 2024In \"organization\"\n\nfemale Space MarinesSpace MarinesWarhammer 40 000Warhammer 40k\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n# Blog Stats\n\n  * 25,873 hits\n\n# Navigation\n\n  * Home\n  * Contact\n  * About\n  * art of war\n  * organization\n  * weapons\n  * history\n  * fantasy\n  * politics\n  * reviews\n  * sci-fi\n  * versus\n  * Links\n  * Fantasy View blog\n\n  * Apr 2024\n  * Mar 2024\n  * Feb 2024\n  * Jan 2024\n  * Dec 2023\n  * Nov 2023\n\n  * Mail\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Bluesky\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * War Fantasy\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
