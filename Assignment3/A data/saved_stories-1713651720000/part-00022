Credit: Feroz Ahmed\n\nThe mystery of how futuristic aircraft-embedded engines, featuring an energy-\nconserving arrangement, make noise has been solved by researchers at the\nUniversity of Bristol.\n\nTheir study, published in Journal of Fluid Mechanics, reveals for the first\ntime how noise is generated and propagated from these engines, technically\nknown as boundary layer ingesting (BLI) ducted fans. The paper is titled\n\"Aeroacoustics of a ducted fan ingesting an adverse pressure gradient boundary\nlayer.\"\n\nBLI ducted fans are similar to the large engines found in modern airplanes but\nare partially embedded into the plane's main body instead of under the wings.\nAs they ingest air from both the front and from the surface of the airframe,\nthey don't have to work as hard to move the plane, so it burns less fuel.\n\nThe research, led by Feroz Ahmed from Bristol's School of Civil, Aerospace and\nDesign Engineering under the supervision of Professor Mahdi Azarpeyvand,\nutilized the University National Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel Facility. They were\nable to identify distinct noise sources originating from the duct, the\nrotating fan, and the air flowing over the curved airframe surface.\n\nThey found that the noise pattern changes depending on how much thrust the fan\nis producing. When the fan is producing high thrust, they observed a noise\npattern similar to what is seen in fans without ducts. But when the fan is\nproducing less thrust, the noise pattern changes because the duct itself\nstarts making more noise.\n\nDr. Ahmed said, \"Our study addresses this urgent issue of noise, which poses a\nmajor obstacle in obtaining certifications, by uncovering the physics behind\nthe noise these configurations produce.\n\n\"By understanding the noise mechanisms in BLI ducted fans, it is hoped that\nindustrial guidelines can be developed for quieter airframe-integrated\npropulsion systems in future aircraft concepts, from large-scale conventional\naircraft to small-scale electric vertical take-off and landing, known as\neVTOL, aircraft.\"\n\nElectric ducted fan mounted next to the curved surface. Credit: Feroz Ahmed\n\nProjects such as the Bell X-22A, Embraer X, Airbus E-fan, Lilium Jet, Green\nJet, and Hybrid Air Vehicle are leading the way in developing these systems\nfor next-generation aircraft. They are becoming more popular due to\nadvancements in powerful electric motors.\n\nDr. Ahmed said, \"But, there is a catch for embedded ducted fans\u2014how loud or\nquiet they are is still a mystery, especially when they are ingesting airflow\nfrom around the curved airframe surface.\n\n\"Previous research on BLI configurations mostly focused on fans without ducts,\nwhere the boundary layer forms over flat airframe surfaces. However there is a\nknowledge gap when it comes to the ducted fans ingesting air around curved\nairframe surfaces, as seen in projects like ONERA NOVA, NASA/MIT Aurora D8,\nand Airbus Nautilus.\n\n\"So, in this study, we have closely examined the various factors that\ncontribute to the noise produced by the embedded ducted fans installed on\ncurved airframe surfaces.\"\n\nComplex noise sources illustration in an embedded engine or boundary layer\ningesting (BLI) ducted fan. Credit: Feroz Ahmed\n\nThe researchers designed a BLI test rig featuring an electric ducted fan\nmounted next to a curved wall, replicating the setup of embedded engines seen\nin designs like the ONERA NOVA aircraft concept. They collected different\ntypes of data from the rig, including measurements of the fan's thrust output\nand the amount of noise generated.\n\nBy dissecting the complexities of noise interaction mechanisms among various\nsources, this framework helped uncover the underlying physics of where the\nnoise originated and how it changed as the fan operated at different thrust\nlevels.\n\nDr. Ahmed concluded, \"With the growing demand for a pleasant flight experience\nwith minimum environmental impact, there is a need for quieter aircraft. This\nresearch has potential applications in developing strategies to reduce noise\nemission in the aviation sector.\n\n\"Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation into unlocking the noise\ncontributions in BLI ducted fans has the potential to steer significant\nresearch activity within the fluid mechanics community. This, in turn, could\nfoster a deeper understanding and further exploration of aeroacoustics\nphenomena in ducted fans exposed to a broad spectrum of incoming turbulent\nflows.\n\n\"Our study sheds light on how noise is generated by futuristic embedded ducted\nfans mounted on curved airframe surfaces, revealing that noise patterns vary\nwith fan thrust levels, offering crucial insights for quieter next-generation\naircraft design.\"\n\nMore information: Ahmed F, Zaman I, Rezgui D, Azarpeyvand M.
