Credit: David Gray/AFP via Getty\n\nAustralia\u2019s iconic Great Barrier Reef is fundamentally changing because of\nrepeated bleaching from high ocean temperatures brought on by climate change,\naccording to marine biologists.\n\n\u201cIt's not a question of reefs dying or reefs disappearing, it's reef\necosystems transforming into a new configuration,\u201d says marine biologist Terry\nHughes, from James Cook University in Townsville, Australia.\n\n\u201cSpecies like fish and crustaceans and so on \u2014 the iconic biodiversity of\nreefs \u2014 all depend on the structure and three dimensionality the habitat\nprovided by corals,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cWhen you lose a lot of corals, it affects\neverything that's dependent on corals.\u201d\n\nCorals \u2018bleach\u2019 when stressed, expelling their colourful resident\nzooxanthellae. According to a report released on 17 April by the Great Barrier\nReef Marine Park Authority \u2013 the Australian government\u2019s reef management\nagency \u2014 the World Heritage-listed reef is experiencing its worst mass\nbleaching event on record. The Reef Snapshot said three-quarters of the entire\nreef is showing signs of bleaching and nearly 40 percent is showing high or\nextreme bleaching.\n\nThe report is based on aerial surveys of 1,080 of the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s\nestimated 3,000 individual reefs, and in-water surveys of a smaller number of\nreefs.\n\nIt showed that while bleaching was observed along the entire length of the\nGreat Barrier Reef, it was most severe in the central and southern regions.\n\n\u201cWe've never seen this level of heat stress across all three regions of the\nGreat Barrier Reef,\u201d says Brisbane-based marine biologist Lissa Schindler,\nfrom the Australian Marine Conservation Society.\n\nThis is the fifth mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in eight\nyears. Hughes warns that climate change-driven increases in ocean temperatures\nare making it more difficult for the Reef\u2019s corals to recover between\nbleaching events. \u201cIn the last six years, we've settled into bleaching every\nother year \u2013 in 2020, 2022, and now 2024 \u2013 and that's simply not enough time\nfor a proper recovery,\u201d he says.\n\n## Global phenomenon\n\nThe Snapshot was one of a series of reports released this week on coral\nbleaching that also sounded alarm bells for reefs. The Australian Institute of\nMarine Science announced on 18 April that the Great Barrier Reef experienced\nwater temperatures in parts of the southern reef at 2.5 degrees Celsius higher\nthan historical summer peaks.\n\nMeanwhile on 15 April the United States\u2019 National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration declared the fourth global coral bleaching event on record, and\nthe second in the past decade. The declaration acknowledges that the warmth of\nthe southern hemisphere summer mirrored coral bleaching events seen in the\nnorthern hemisphere summer last year.\n\nIt comes as global sea surface temperatures again broke records in 2023,\nassociated with a strong El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, recording an annual average\ntemperature around 0.3 degrees Celsius higher in the second half of 2023\ncompared with 2022.\n\n\u201cThere have been very high temperatures driven by climate change all across\nthe world, and there has been coral bleaching in many other countries,\u201d says\nenvironmental scientist Roger Beeden, chief scientist for the Great Barrier\nReef Marine Park Authority, Townsville.\n\nHughes says the warming climate is pushing reefs to have less coral, and the\nmix of coral species is changing. For example, the branching and table-shaped\ncorals are often the fastest to recover from a bleaching event because they\nare fast-growing, Hughes says. However they\u2019re also very prone to bleaching\nand have higher levels of mortality during bleaching events.\n\n\u201cIt's a bit analogous to a fire on land through a forest, that favours a\nbounce-back by flammable grasses before the trees can recover,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIronically, that that bounce-back, that resilience, undermines the ability of\nthe reef to cope with the next inevitable bleaching event.\u201d Seaweeds also\nflourish when corals degrade.\n\nBeeden says those who live and work on the Reef are observing significant\nchanges. \u201cThere's historical photos that show inshore reefs that were laden\nwith coral, and that\u2019s very different now,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says there are an estimated 450 different species of coral on the Reef, and\nsuch diversity means there is a chance the Reef will adapt to the changing\nconditions, even if it changes character. \u201cWhat we see within species is\ndefinitely there is variability in how they respond to stress events.\u201d\n\nHughes says the solution to the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s bleaching problem is\nclear. \u201cReduce greenhouse gas emissions.
