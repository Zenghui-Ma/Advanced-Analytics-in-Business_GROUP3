It\u2019s tempting to think that the stuff we make, the\nproducts and content we spend our days delivering, is what makes a company\nvaluable. There\u2019s a reason that \"content is king\" has been a defining mantra\nof the past decade. Surely, if you make the coolest product, you\u2019ll produce\nthe most valuable company. But this isn\u2019t as true as you might think. Long-\nterm enterprise value\u2014that is, building a big-ass business\u2014is only possible by\nhaving a differentiated way of getting that great product to a customer. The\nchannel through which users receive and access content matters most.\n\nThis argument comes from investor and former Benchmark Capital partner Mitch\nLasky, and it\u2019s been ping-ponging through my mind for months. Every financial\ndocument I read, every analysis I write, Lasky is in my head reminding me\nabout why a company becomes valuable. It\u2019s distribution, stupid.\n\nLasky is one of the greatest consumer investors of all time with a portfolio\nthat includes Discord, Riot Games, and Snap. Much of his career was focused on\nvideo games, a submarket of the tech industry that I\u2019ve found often\nprecipitates broader trends. Nearly every consumer innovation you come in\ncontact with, in one way or another, owes its lineage to some video game\ncompany\u2019s innovation in content, pricing, or go-to-market strategy. Nvidia\nbuilt graphics chips for video game rendering, Slack started as a video game\nchat system, and that 30 percent fee that Apple takes from developers\npartially stems from mid-1980s agreements between Nintendo and Pac-Man creator\nNamco.\n\nLasky teamed up with fellow investor Blake Robbins to host a podcast called\nGameCraft, which takes distribution innovation as its core idea and shows its\nefficacy at driving the last 40 years of gaming. This piece mostly draws from\nepisode 14, \u201cDistribution.\u201d\n\nHis thesis was good enough that I think it can be applied to all bits\ncompanies: software, content, marketplaces\u2014all of them mirror video games. If\nyou want to know how to make your startup valuable, you should learn and apply\nthe lessons of the video game industry.\n\n### Mind the toll\n\nLasky argues that distribution means \u201cthe totality of costs that exist in\nbetween getting the finished product in the hands of the developer and the\nplayable product in the hands of the consumer.\u201d Distribution is not just a\nmarketing cost; it is a series of choices around pricing, packaging, and a\nmyriad of other things that interconnect on how you get your product in the\nhands of customers.\n\nHe uses a metaphor of a network of roads connecting developers and consumers:\n\n\u201cAs content moves along a particular pathway through that network, that\nmovement has an associated cost. There may not be an explicit toll, like, for\nexample, distributing through the iOS App Store, where you know going in that\nyou're going to pay 30 percent. But, regardless of what pathway you take,\nthere's always going to be a cost.\u201c\n\nUnlock the power of algorithmic trading with Composer.

After all, sales and marketing generate the\ndemand\u2014that\u2019s their job! It is especially tempting because that is how\nfinancial documents are designed. Marketing costs are legible, platform fees\nare obvious. A CFO prepares a spreadsheet each month where you can see how\nmuch you spent on ads. But this bucketed thinking is a disease.\n\nTo make matters worse, investors are super-spreaders of this ideology. They\nalso perpetuate this fallacy by simplifying your business into ratios like\nLTV/CAC. Metrics are important and useful signals. However, by assuming that\nthe payback period for acquisition costs are all you have to account for to\ngrow a company, you forget the whole point of a startup, which is to make\nsomething people want.\n\nThere\u2019s a better way to think about distribution. Novel product usage\npatterns? That\u2019s distribution. New pricing models? Also distribution. Building\nsocial sharing into the core workflow loop of your app? Distribution.\nExpanding the capabilities you put into the distribution capability bucket\nallows for founders to be more innovative.\n\nThis is also true for costs. Distribution isn\u2019t simply what you pay Meta for\nads; it is the opportunity cost that comes from picking a certain channel:\n\n\u201cIt's not only the value in monetary terms for cost. Sure, it\u2019s the 30 percent\nof revenue that you have to pay to Apple. But when you go on [the video game\nplatform] Steam, you're making a choice about your control over the customer,\nyour access to certain kinds of information, and your ability to communicate\ndirectly with the customer.\u201d\n\nDigital media companies have been learning this ugly lesson for the past four\nyears. Firms like BuzzFeed chose to build distribution mediated through social\nmedia platforms. It worked for a while, giving it access to enormous scale\nquickly. However, its choice to rely on platforms like Facebook also took away\ncrucial forms of customer engagement. In reality, the audience was borrowed\nfrom those platforms with relatively little demographic information (hurting\nits advertising effectiveness), and the company captured few direct lines to\nits readers, such as email addresses. While BuzzFeed once had a $1.5 billion\nprivate valuation, it went public, shut down its news division entirely, and\nis worth a measly $55 million today.\n\nSubscribe\n\n### As go video games, so goes software\n\nIn the 1980s and nineties, video games were physical cartridges and disks\ndistributed through retailers. A kid might beg his parents to go to Best Buy,\nbuy the latest Mario game, and go home to play.\n\nThe margins looked something like this:\n\n  * A retailer would sell a game for about $50.\n  * Of that, the game\u2019s publisher might receive $40.\n  * Distributors like Ingram Micro would take a cut of about $15 from the publisher to ship the game to a retailer.\n\nAssuming no additional marketing costs, every time a video game was sold, a\npublisher would end up with roughly 50 percent of the advertised price, or in\nthis case, $25.\n\nTo make it even worse, that was just the publisher's cut! If you were a\ndeveloper studio partnered with a publisher, then a developer may end up with\nas little as 10 percent of the listed price. The actual labor that creates the\ngame walks away with basically nothing.\n\nThe companies that got big back then, like Activision and Electronic Arts, had\ngreat games, but they won because of distribution innovation. They \u201cbuilt\ntheir own distribution system so that they didn't have to rely on the\nexpensive services that Ingram Micro would provide,\u201d Lasky said. \u201cInstead,\nthey would do it themselves.\u201d Activision hired an army of package packers and\nsalesmen. Even with all the overhead, this distribution system lowered the\ncost from the 14-or-so percent a distributor would take down to single digits.\nCalling back to the invisible costs that permeate distribution choices: It\nturned out that building their own distribution arms also allowed them to\nbundle games at retailers. If Best Buy wanted to stock the latest FIFA game,\nit would have to also leave shelf space for Electronic Arts\u2019s newest\nexperimental franchise.\n\nA similar story played out with enterprise software. Microsoft built\nimpressive software, but it won because it found cheaper ways to get its\nsoftware directly into the hands of users. Microsoft initially convinced IBM\nto subsidize its building an operating system, MS-DOS, and as part of that\nagreement, the former were allowed to sell the operating system to other\ncomputer manufacturers. Microsoft then struck pre-installation agreements with\nmost personal computer manufacturers, allowing it to skip retail distribution\nentirely.\n\nWhen video games went from physical disks to digital platform publishing, a\nnearly identical evolution occurred. In comparison to the 10 percent margin a\nvideo game developer might get by teaming up with a publisher, working\ndirectly with the platforms seems like a relatively good deal. Most app\ndevelopers only have to give 30 percent of their revenue to Apple or Google or\nSteam (an online game store founded in 2003), and they can cut out all of\nthose middlemen. The cycle goes something like this:\n\n  * A new platform has a highly qualified audience with high price tolerance and a propensity to pay.\n  * There is relatively little competition.\n  * Developers and users flood the platform, ascribing more value to the discovery portion of distribution.\n\nThe original 30 percent fee\u2014whose value once included the totality of\ndistribution\u2014now only covers the end transaction point, not the discovery\nalong the way. Marketing costs creep back in, and search ads replace shelving\nfees (i.e., paying retailers for placement in the most visible parts of\nshelves). It\u2019s still a better deal for some content creators, but it isn\u2019t a\nlong-term way to build enterprise value. Saying your distribution strategy is\nto list something in the App Store is the equivalent of, in the nineties,\nwalking through the Mall of America shouting out the name of your video game.\n\nOnce a platform shifts from the role of curator to distributor, the take rate\nwill stay the same, but the value offered to suppliers on the platform will be\never-less.\n\n### The race is on for network effects\n\nDisrupting digital giants is incredibly challenging. The clearest example is\nthe struggles of Epic Games against Steam. Steam is like a games-focused App\nStore. Gamers can build friend lists and purchase video games, and the\nplatform charges a 30 percent fee to video game publishers hoping to sell\nthrough its marketplace.\n\nIn 2018, Epic, which makes Fortnite, decided to launch a direct challenger to\nSteam. Remarkably, it only had a 12 percent take rate\u201460 percent lower than\nSteam\u2019s 30 percent. For developers who built their games using Epic\u2019s Unreal\nEngine, a video game creation system, Epic Games Store also dropped its\nadditional 5 percent revenue take rate from that software, resulting in gob-\nstopping levels of savings for a video game developer willing to leave Steam\nfor it. To further juice the store, Epic subsidized the demand side with free\ngames.\n\nStill, that wasn\u2019t enough. Despite the savings for suppliers, both developers\nand users still overwhelmingly prefer Steam. Steam has roughly 50,000 games on\nits platform, while Epic\u2019s store only has about 2,000 as of 2022. Epic has yet\nto turn on a profit on the platform while Steam is making hundreds of millions\nper year.\n\nTwo-sided network effects, where the greater the supply, the more demand-side\nbenefits there are\u2014and vice versa\u2014are so powerful that all of that isn\u2019t\nenough to take Steam down. Just like how social media platforms are more\nvaluable to users and advertisers alike when more people and developers use\nit, the same is true for video game platforms.\n\nDistribution innovation is about taking advantage of market arbitrages\u2014places\nwhere you can profitability acquire customers\u2014and building network effects as\nquickly as possible.\n\nIn 2004, soon after Steam launched, its parent company Valve made an\nenormously popular series of games called Half-Life, available exclusively on\nSteam. Even if you bought a disk of the game at Best Buy, you still had to\ndownload Steam. While the company wasn\u2019t the first to pioneer exclusive\noriginals as a growth strategy, it was among the first to do it in order to\nbuild an online store. That original seed in 2003, coupled with 15 years of\ncompounding network effects, forced Epic to sacrifice hundreds of millions of\ndollars to try to compete.\n\nThis is why platform shifts are the most important moments in tech. The\ntransition from physical distribution to internet distribution set Steam up\nfor decades of profit. Similar dynamics occurred in enterprise software, where\nthe companies that owned the cloud transition (like Adobe and Microsoft)\nthrived, while others were unable to make the jump (Cisco, IBM, etc.).\n\n### Distribution is all you need\n\nWe sit on the precipice of multiple platform shifts. In hardware, there are\nnew AI-driven devices like Humane. Elsewhere, the Apple Vision Pro mixed-\nreality headset represents a remarkably different capability. In software, I\nbelieve that large language models and generative AI may be one of our most\nsignificant inventions ever.\n\nIt is the most exciting, dynamic time in my entire career. The world is\nchanging fast. Think of a technology paradigm shift like a massive volcano\nerupting. The landscape changes, and new mountain peaks appear. Sometimes the\ngiants of the old world can neatly transition, sometimes they can\u2019t.\n\nBut in this new world, the temptation is to get overly focused on building\nsomething cool with flashy tech. Mostly, because that\u2019s the most fun! Very few\npeople get their jollies debating the efficacies of pricing strategy. Lasky\ntaught me that while great product and great content grows audiences, the\ncompanies that ultimately conquer industries are those that know that\ndistribution is king.\n\nEvan Armstrong is the lead writer for Every, where he writes the Napkin Math\ncolumn.
