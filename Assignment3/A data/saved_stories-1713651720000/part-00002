The Senate is expected to quickly\n> take up the measure, and President Joe Biden promised Wednesday to sign it\n> immediately.\n>\n> If signed into law, the bill would deliver a significant blow to a video-\n> sharing app used by as many as 170 million Americans. Its enactment would\n> also mark a major setback to the company\u2019s intense lobbying efforts,\n> especially by Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew, who made the rounds on\n> Capitol Hill last month in a bid to get the Senate to squelch the\n> legislation.\n\nI\u2019ve already explained why the TikTok ban is both unconstitutional and would\nnot do anything to fix the \u201cconcerns\u201d that people have raised about it. We\u2019ve\nalso discussed how those most vocally pushing for the TikTok ban appear to be\nfinancially conflicted.\n\nBut, even more important than all that, is that a TikTok ban would be a\ndisaster for the open web. Yes, other countries have banned apps, but they\ntend to be authoritarian countries that have never liked and never supported\nan open web.\n\nBanning an entire app in the US would be a massive attack on the very concept\nof an open web. And that\u2019s really unfortunate, given that the US used to be\nthe world\u2019s most vocal supporter of the web being kept open and free.\n\nThe New York Times recently had a good article calling out what a disaster the\nban would be for the open web.\n\n> Digital rights groups and others around the world have taken notice \u2014 and\n> raised the question of how the moves against TikTok contradict the United\n> States\u2019 arguments in favor of an open internet.\n>\n> A Russian opposition blogger, Aleksandr Gorbunov, posted on social media\n> last month that Russia could use the move to shut down services like\n> YouTube. And digital rights advocates globally are expressing fears of a\n> ripple effect, with the United States providing cover for authoritarians who\n> want to censor the internet.\n>\n> In March, the Chinese government, which controls its country\u2019s internet,\n> said America had \u201cone way of saying and doing things about the United\n> States, and another way of saying and doing things about other countries,\u201d\n> citing the TikTok legislation.\n\nPassing the TikTok ban would effectively be telling the world (1) it\u2019s totally\nokay to ban apps you don\u2019t like, and (2) the U.S. long-standing commitment to\nthe open web was always fake and always bullshit, because the second a\nsuccessful foreign app came along, we tossed out those principles.\n\n> \u201cIt would diminish the U.S.\u2019s standing in promoting internet freedom,\u201d said\n> Juan Carlos Lara, the executive director of Derechos Digitales, a Latin\n> American digital rights group based in Chile. \u201cIt would definitely not\n> bolster its own case for promoting a free and secure, stable and\n> interoperable internet.\u201d\n\nAnd that signal will be heard loud and clear around the world:\n\n> Mishi Choudhary, a lawyer who founded the New Delhi-based Software Freedom\n> Law Center, said the Indian government would also use a U.S. ban to justify\n> further crackdowns. It has already engaged in internet shutdowns, she said,\n> and it banned TikTok in 2020 over border conflicts with China.\n>\n> \u201cThis gives them good reason to find confidence in their past actions, but\n> also emboldens them to take similar future actions,\u201d she said in an\n> interview.\n>\n> Mr. Lara of Derechos Digitales noted that countries like Venezuela and\n> Nicaragua had already passed laws that gave the government more control over\n> online content. He said increased government control of the internet was a\n> \u201ctempting idea\u201d that \u201creally risks materializing if such a thing is seen in\n> places like the U.S.\u201d\n>\n> A forced sale or ban of TikTok could also make it harder for the American\n> government to ask other countries to embrace an internet governed by\n> international organizations, digital rights experts said.\n\nAnd, if the goal here is to hurt China in particular, that may backfire\nmassively:\n\n> Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the National Security Project at the\n> American Civil Liberties Union, said that if the TikTok measure became law,\n> the \u201chypocrisy would be inescapable and the dividends to China enormous.\u201d\n\nChina has long made a big deal whenever the US government is hypocritical like\nthis. This would be a huge PR win for the Chinese government. It would allow\nit to claim that its Great Firewall approach to the internet is right, and\nthat the US was admitting that openness and an open internet fails. It would\nallow China to call out US hypocrisy, and that matters a lot at this moment\nwhen China is working hard to build stronger relationships with lots of\ncountries around the globe.\n\nBanning TikTok won\u2019t help the US against China. It will play right into\nChina\u2019s hands. It doesn\u2019t need TikTok to get data on Americans, nor to try to\ninfluence Americans. But, destroying decades of US foreign policy promoting an\nopen and free internet serves China\u2019s interests massively.\n\nFiled Under: censorship, china, hypocrisy, open internet, tiktok ban\nCompanies: tiktok\n\n56 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * No, TikTok Is Not \u2018Programmable Fentanyl.'

The question is whether it\u2019s an effective\ntool at doing so, or not. It\u2019s not a crazy argument that TikTok is more\neffective than something like a PR statement that was used in the past. You\ncan\u2019t really conflate the two.\n\nThere is a very strong argument that an open web, and US consistency, is more\nimportant than the influence concern. But you haven\u2019t really debunked the\nconcern about influence, at all.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThis comment has been deemed insightful by the community.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 5:11 pm\n\n# Re:\n\nYou can\u2019t \u201cdebunk a concern\u201d.

Hypothetically, lets say TikTok did tweak\nit\u2019s algorithm to disfavor certain topics. How would you be able to tell,\nassuming it\u2019s not a hamfisted full ban? It\u2019d be virtually impossible.\n\nJust because it\u2019s not easily testable doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen or the\nconcern isn\u2019t real. The fact that it\u2019s not verifiable is itself one of the\nconcerns (and a \u2018testable one\u2019 concern, strictly speaking, if you want to\nphrase it that way. We can test whether we can verify something happening on\nTikTok or not. We can\u2019t.)\n\nYou can\u2019t claim that something isn\u2019t a concern simply because it\u2019s been made\noff limits to test.

There\u2019s no question that TikTok is a op run by Chinese intelligence and that its principle reason for existence is data/metadata gathering.\n  2. However, its reach is limited (look at the demographics of its users). None of us on the outside know whether that\u2019s intentional or not.\n  3. Facebook also exists mainly to gather data/metadata. I\u2019d say the same about Twitter, except that more recently it exists mainly to gratify the ego of pathetic manbaby Elon Musk.\n  4. Others \u2013 Slack, Discord, LinkedIn, etc. \u2013 exist for the same reason. Data/metadata is immensely profitable, there\u2019s always someone willing to pay, and the lack of meaningful legislation in the US means that it\u2019s open season. For everyone. Including Chinese intelligence, who no doubt have direct feeds of all of it...because why wouldn\u2019t they?\n  5. So IF we wish to make the argument that TikTok should be banned \u2013 so should the rest. If I put on my pentester hat, that\u2019d be bad: those operations provide a massive attack surface for social engineering against hundreds of millions of people. If I put on my defensive engineer hat, that\u2019d be one of the biggest improvements that we could make in aggregate security posture.\n  6. Nobody, NOBODY, in American politics has the stones to make that argument. And even if someone could, the GOP is determined to make Congress nonfunctional and performative as a homage to their dear fascist, pants-shitting, psychotic, demented leader.

Your claim would have legs to stand on if\nthe ban provision were not included in the legislation, as forced divestiture\nalone would be legal on its own, but First Amendment case law has established\na right to receive material, even if the government disapproves of said\nmaterial.\n\nLamont v.

The courts apply the strict/intermediate scrutiny\nstandard to national security laws that conflict with the 1A, and in many\ncases, have determined that the government interest in such matters would be\nbest served by less restrictive measures; a clean forced sale without the\nthreat of speech suppression and blocking would be less restrictive and pass\nlegal muster, so would mitigative measures like data privacy regulations\n(which Congress is actually proposing as of this writing) or the stalled\nproposal to allow the government to monitor TikTok\u2019s algorithm and data flows.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThat Anonymous Coward (profile) says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 6:31 pm\n\nMeanwhile children will go hungry while school is out this summer because\nbeing poor is a sin in the imaginary christian nation who follow a man who\nsaid care for the children & poor unless you need to feel superior.\n\nAll of the sins they claim TikTok has done, Congress has done worse.

We\u2019re just going to waste taxpayer dollars on legislation that may\nend up being held unconstitutional in the courts, just like those attempts.\nClearly, the majority of D.C. doesn\u2019t realize that First Amendment protections\napply to a still substantial enough extent to foreign nationals and entities,\nand many are kidding themselves that they\u2019re not regulating speech (it still\ncounts), especially when they\u2019ve expressed that they have issues with certain\ncontent (which would doom it on even intermediate scrutiny grounds, as the 1A\ndoesn\u2019t allow the government to broadly regulate speech based on content,\nincluding, as Lamont v. Postmaster General established, propaganda).\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be worse, because it undermines the message that Biden and\nDemocrats are pro-democracy (especially among young voters, whose speech,\nexpression and, for some, income would be impacted by this law), when being\npro-democracy involves standing up for free speech and expression. Backing a\nlaw that likely violates the 1A to facilitate a sale of a platform does the\nopposite, and Democrats could have advocated for eliminating the ban provision\nso it could stand up in court, instead the majority of them are choosing to\ncosign on legislation that gives TikTok leverage in court, in the government\nself-own that Trump\u2019s EO and the Montana ban attempt were subjected to, along\nwith the fact that politicians have been clear content is an issue (also what\ngot the Montana law blocked).\n\nThe \u201cban if you don\u2019t comply with the sale\u201d provision would still be\nconsidered an impermissible restriction on speech, and given that TikTok has\n150-175 million users, a burdensome restriction that would fail strict\nscrutiny and, given the government hasn\u2019t provided (and may very well still\nnot have) credible evidence of an immediate threat, likely intermediate\nscrutiny as well, which is one of the reasons Trump\u2019s EO failed.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\n## Add Your Comment Cancel reply\n\nDaily Deal: The Ultimate Adobe CC Training Bundle\n\nSCOTUS Needs To Take Up The Texas Age Verification Lawsuit\n\nFollow Techdirt\n\n### Techdirt Daily Newsletter\n\nA weekly news podcast from Mike Masnick & Ben Whitelaw\n\nSubscribe now to Ctrl-Alt-Speech \u00bb\n\nEssential Reading\n\n#### The Techdirt Greenhouse\n\nRead the latest posts:\n\n  * Winding Down Our Latest Greenhouse Panel: The Lessons Learned From SOPA/PIPA\n  * From The Revolt Against SOPA To The EU's Upload Filters\n  * Did We Miss Our Best Chance At Regulating The Internet?\n\nRead All \u00bb\n\n#### Trending Posts\n\n  * 'Lol, No' Is The Perfect Response To LAPD's Nonsense 'IP' Threat Letter Over 'Fuck The LAPD' Shirt\n  * Senate Must Follow House's Lead In Passing Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act\n  * Cops Claim Body Cam Footage Of Wrong Address Raid Would Be 'Dangerous' To Release To General Public\n\nTechdirt Deals\n\nBuy Now\n\n$150.00\n\nHushed Private Phone Line: Lifetime Virtual Number Subscription\n\nTechdirt Insider Discord\n\nThe latest chatter on the Techdirt Insider Discord channel...\n\n  * John Roddy: Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd.

Maybe someone can get Kagi added to this: [link]\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/wiki/index\n\n  * mildconcern: I found after trying it for a trial that it saved me more than enough in time to make up for the ten bucks a month.\n  * Worst comes to worse I'll just stop supporting those Techdirt cranks. *grins*\n  * Samuel Abram: That\u2019s fair\n  * Though if I were you, I\u2019d _never_ stop supporting these Techdirt cranks. Quality journalism is worth paying for.\n  * John Roddy: The post of Paxton complaining about the community note being wrong now has its own community note explaining how his explanation of it being wrong is wrong.\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah. I had sent that to @Tim Cushing earlier to check out. Hilarious.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder if Paxton'll retaliate against Elon and make him keep shopping for a state to reincorporate Tesla in\n  * John Roddy: Also I'm banned from submitting any community notes, apparently.\n  * As is anyone else who ever said the word \"cis\" in any context.\n  * candescence: I swear, Elon is the peak example of white male fragility\n  * Samuel Abram: So I guess you could never talk about Transalpine Gaul and [redacted]alpine Gaul, right?\n  * BentFranklin: ...or be a chemist\n  * mildconcern: or the loose trade alliance of former USSR republics\n  * Mike Masnick: interesting article about kagi, given we were just talking about it... https://www.osnews.com/story/139...\n\nhttps://www.osnews.com/story/139270/do-not-use-kagi/\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Friday  \n  \n---  \n19:39| Senate Must Follow House's Lead In Passing Fourth Amendment Is Not For\nSale Act (9)  \n15:08| 'Lol, No' Is The Perfect Response To LAPD's Nonsense 'IP' Threat Letter\nOver 'Fuck The LAPD' Shirt (10)  \n12:52| SCOTUS Needs To Take Up The Texas Age Verification Lawsuit (12)  \n10:54| The US Banning TikTok Would Play Right Into China\u2019s Hands, And Destroy\nDecades Of US Work On Promoting An Open Internet (56)  \n10:51| Daily Deal: The Ultimate Adobe CC Training Bundle (0)  \n09:26| Congressional Testimony On Section 230 Was So Wrong That It Should Be\nStruck From The Record (27)  \n05:26| Apple Praised For Repair Reforms Only Made Possible By New Oregon Law\nIt Tried To Kill (3)  \n  \n## Thursday  \n  \n20:45| UK Prosecutors Apologize For Pursuing BS Charges Against A Photographer\n(11)  \n15:32| Palworld Creator Loves That Others Are Trying To Clone The Game (18)  \n13:02| Sextortion Is A Real & Serious Criminal Issue; Blaming Section 230 For\nIt Is Not (27)  \n  \n##### More\n\n\u00d7\n\n## Email This Story\n\nThis feature is only available to registered users.
