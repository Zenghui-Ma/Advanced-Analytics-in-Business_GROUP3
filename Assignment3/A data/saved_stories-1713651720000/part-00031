Conventional energy solutions -\nincluding fossil fuels, batteries and other alternative energy generation\nmethods \u2013 have their challenges. For example, they are either often too large,\nrequire cables or stationary charging, negatively impact on the environment,\nor their power density is too low. Ultra-thin and flexible solar cells made\nfrom a new material called \"perovskite\" are proving to be an efficient and\nlightweight solution to facilitate self-sufficient energy generation over\nextended periods of time.\n\nAs part of a groundbreaking development, researchers at the JKU (Department of\nSoft Matter Physics and the LIT Soft Material Lab; dept. head: Prof. Martin\nKaltenbrunner, and the Linz Institute for Organic Solar Cells (LIOS); dept.\nhead: Prof. Niyazi Serdar Sariciftci) have now succeeded in developing ultra-\nlightweight quasi-2D perovskite solar cells with an unprecedented power output\nof up to 44 watts per gram and a comparatively high level of stability.\n\nDeveloping our own solar material Christoph Putz, one of the study\u2019s lead\nauthors, remarked: \"Ultra-thin and lightweight solar cells not only have\nenormous potential to revolutionize the way energy is generated in the\naerospace industry, there are also a wide range of applications that include\nwearable electronics, and the Internet of Things, that can also benefit from\nthis new technology. Lightweight, adaptable and highly efficient photovoltaics\nare the key to developing the next generation of self-sufficient energy\nsystems.\"\n\nAn ultralight and flexible solar cell module 20x thinner than a strand of\nhuman hair can power a wide range of electronics anywhere there is light. Less\nthan 2.5 micrometers (1 micrometer = 1 millionth of a meter) thick, the\nquasi-2D perovskite solar cells deliver an impressive 20.1% efficiency while\nmaintaining a high degree of flexibility. Above all, the remarkable power\ndensity of 44 W/g clearly sets it apart from other types of solar cell\ntechnologies.\n\nIn order to create operationally reliable, highly stable, and flexible solar\ncells with a high power-to-weight ratio, there needs to be a balance between\nlow gas and moisture permeability, a high degree of flexibility and\ntransparent plastic substrates combined with sturdy photovoltaic materials.\nThe cells' operational stability was significantly improved by applying a\ntransparent aluminum oxide layer to the thin film and then optimizing the\nsolar cell material itself.\n\nTechnology for everyday use To demonstrate their new technology's\ncapabilities, researchers fitted a palm-sized, commercial quadcopter drone\nwith the ultra-light solar cells. Twenty-four of these cells were seamlessly\nintegrated into the drone's frame, making up just 1/400 of its total weight.\nThe configuration enabled the drone to operate self-sufficiently and perform\nconsecutive charge-flight-charge cycles without wired recharging, thereby\ndemonstrating just how efficient and sustainable the solar cells are.\n\nThe new technology has potential applications in search & rescue operations,\nlarge-scale mapping, generating solar power in space, and exploring the solar\nsystem.\n\nMore recently, the Mars helicopter, \"Ingenuity\", impressively demonstrated\njust how important self-sufficient solar-powered aviation is by being the\nfirst aircraft to successfully launch from Earth and land on another planet.\n\nThe research has now been published in an article titled \"Flexible quasi-2D\nperovskite solar cells with high specific power and improved stability for\nenergy-autonomous drones\" in the journal Nature Energy\n(DOI:10.1038/s41560-024-01500-2).\n\n## News\n\nPublished on\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nShare this story\n\n  * , opens an external URL in a new window\n  * , opens an external URL in a new window\n  * , opens an external URL in a new window\n\n1 / 5\n\nProf. Martin Kaltenbrunner; photo credit: JKU\n\nSolar-operated drone; photo credit: JKU\n\nSolar-operated drone; photo credit: JKU\n\nSolar-operated drone; photo credit: JKU\n\nSolar-powered drone research group; Photo credit: JKU\n\nProf. Martin Kaltenbrunner; photo credit: JKU\n\nSolar-operated drone; photo credit: JKU\n\n## Downloads & Links\n\n  * Solar-operated drone; photo credit: JKU , opens in new window\n  * Solar-operated drone; photo credit: JKU , opens in new window\n  * Solar-operated drone; photo credit: JKU , opens in new window\n  * Solar-powered drones research group; Photo credit: JKU , opens in new window\n  * Press release (full text, German only) , opens in new window\n  * Prof. Kaltenbrunner; photo credit: JKU , opens in new window\n\n## Additional news stories you may be interested in\n\nNews\n\n13.03.2023\n\n### Neue Technologie: Autonome Drohnenschw\u00e4rme retten k\u00fcnftig Menschen\n\nWeltweit etablieren sich vermehrt Drohnengruppen in den\nBlaulichtorganisationen.
