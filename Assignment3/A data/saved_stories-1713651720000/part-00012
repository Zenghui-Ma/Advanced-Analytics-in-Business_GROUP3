I have been playing video\ngames since the Atari 2600 and have witnessed many ground breaking moments\nover the years such as the birth of the PC as a gaming rig, the domination of\nthe consoles and the all important birth of multiplayer games on the internet.\nI have earned the right to have my say on the state of the gaming industry and\nmore importantly the state of some of the games that are sold to us, the\ngamers. So sit back and enjoy reviews in my own no holds barred style but with\na comedy focus.
