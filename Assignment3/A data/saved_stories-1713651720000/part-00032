Today, the Australian defense budget is undergoing a massive\nincrease, there's a greater emphasis on domestic defense production, and the\nRoyal Australian Navy is working with the US, Britain, and (perhaps) Japan to\nacquire long-range nuclear attack submarines capable of operating north of the\ncontinent.\n\nMore Stories\n\nDrones\n\nSolar-cell-packin' drone uses sunlight for on-the-spot recharging\n\nTechnology\n\nMicrosoft AI creates scary real talkie videos from a single photo\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nPart of this new strategy involves developing autonomous platforms that can\nact as force multipliers. Instead of just sending out submarine patrols,\nCanberra wants to include autonomous drones that can operate for long\ndurations without a crew to increase the capabilities of the patrols.\n\nDeveloped by the Defence Department and Anduril Australia along with industry\npartners, Ghost Shark is described as \"Mission Zero\" for the government's\nAdvanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator (ASCA). The craft is part of the\ngovernment's project to build or acquire subsea warfare capabilities and new\nautonomous and uncrewed underwater vehicles, which was supposed to take three\nyears to create the first prototype but is ahead of schedule.\n\nGhost Shark on the pier\n\nAustralian Government\n\nThough not many details have been given about the specifications of the craft,\nit's smaller than a conventional submarine because it doesn't require the\npressure-proof hull for a crew or the complex sound-deadening equipment needed\nto muffle the noise of the submariners' moving about and their life support\nequipment. Instead, the machinery and electronics are set in watertight\nmodules.\n\nWhen deployed, Ghost Shark will allow the Royal Australian Navy to carry out\nstealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare with persistent intelligence,\nsurveillance, reconnaissance and strike capabilities. The craft will be able\nto work with Navy and allied vessels as part of the AUKUS treaty.\n\n\"This collaboration combines Navy\u2019s expertise, ASCA\u2019s speed to delivery,\nDefence\u2019s scientific smarts and Anduril Australia\u2019s experience in agile\ninnovation,\" said Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Mark Hammond. \"We are a nation\ngirt by sea, and the Ghost Shark is one of the tools we are developing for the\nNavy to patrol and protect our oceans and our connection to the world.\"\n\nSource: Australian Government\n\nView gallery - 3 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.

That seems logical apart from\nthe \u2018pressure-proof hull\u2019 comment. If you go to certain depths, your hull\nbetter be pressure proof, otherwise you won\u2019t have a sub for very long; crew\nor no crew\n\nyawood April 19, 2024 07:18 AM\n\n@Robt Existing submarines have a casing around the pressure-proof hull, inside\nwhich certain things can be carried. These are flooded areas so it does not\nmatter how deep the submarines go they can't collapse. It is the same with\nthis vessel. As the article says, the machinery and electronics are set in\nwater-tight modules which implies that the rest will be flooded. The water-\ntight modules will be pressure-proof to a certain depth (I imagine, much\ngreater than would be necessary with a crewed vessel with a large pressurised\narea). You are right in that even this will collapse eventually but the\npressure-proof areas that contain machinery and electronics is much smaller\nand thus more easily constructed. There is also a great deal of machinery in a\ncrewed submarine that is just there to keep the crew alive and all this can be\ndiscarded.\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
