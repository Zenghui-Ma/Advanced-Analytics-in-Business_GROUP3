We\u2019re just working in it.\n\nRani Molla\n\n2h\n\nThe process of getting a job is looking more and more like a battle of the\nbots. Candidates are increasingly using artificial intelligence software to\ntrawl for openings, tailor cover letters to specific jobs, and even apply for\njobs all on its own. On the other side of the battlefield, companies are\nupping their use of AI to find candidates, communicate with them, and rank\ntheir applications. For many candidates and employers AI has become table\nstakes, and the situation can feel a bit like an arms race to try and keep up.\n\nThe question has become whether each side offloading parts of the hiring\nprocess to bots, so that essentially computers are talking to computers, will\ncreate more signal than noise, and undermine the entire process of recruitment\naltogether.\n\nAs early as 2020, more than 90% of employers were using software (including,\nbut not limited to, AI) to initially rank or filter mid-and high-skills\ncandidates, according to a survey of more than 2,000 executives. Now it\u2019s more\nlike 100%, according to one of the report\u2019s authors, Harvard Business School\nmanagement professor Joseph Fuller. Currently about a quarter of HR\ndepartments are using AI, primarily in talent acquisition, according to a new\nreport by the Society of Human Resource Management, which expects that to rise\nto 50% next year.\n\nTop recruitment software and applicant tracking system iCIMS, which boasts 3\nmillion users including a quarter of the Fortune 500, uses AI and generative\nAI to connect job seekers with pertinent roles and help recruiters write job\ndescriptions, communicate with candidates, and rank applicants. That doesn\u2019t\nmean AI is choosing the candidates, but it is giving recruiters otherwise\ninundated with applications with a short list off which to respond.\n\nOne reason those recruiters are inundated with applications in the first\nplace? Job seekers are also heavily leveraging AI and automation tools to\nsecure the best chance of obtaining some kind of placement.\n\nEarly in 2023, not long after ChatGPT was first released, a survey by Resume\nBuilder showed that about half of job seekers were using the technology to\nhelp write their resumes or cover letters. Presumably it\u2019s much higher now as\nthe service gets more adoptions and as a cottage industry of software\ncompanies \u2014 Teal and EarnBetter among many others, as well as popular job\nsites like ZipRecruiter and LinkedIn \u2014 has emerged to formalize the process of\nusing AI in the job search. That includes finding the best job openings for\nparticular candidates, optimizing their applications, and suggesting follow-\ncommunications.\n\nLinkedIn says that of the premium users who\u2019ve had access to the AI experience\nso far, 90% have said it was useful and 70% have used AI-suggestions for\nwriting and profile recommendations. It\u2019s currently rolling out these\nexperiences more broadly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe number of job applications per job seeker are up 6% year over year,\naccording to data provided by LinkedIn, though it\u2019s impossible to tell how\nmuch of that is due to AI versus, say, a weaker job market.\n\nAI is certainly enabling some people to \u201cspray and pray\u201d their applications, a\nversion of \u201cone-click apply\u201d on steroids. Candidates are using such technology\nto send out hundreds of applications, where they in the past would have only\nsubmitted dozens. Business Insider reporter Aki Ito recently employed AI-\nenabled job search bots to send out previously impossible levels of\napplications on her behalf. These tools sent out the wrong cover letter and\nmade up lies about languages she spoke, but still she got a few calls back.\n\nOn the recruitment side, such behavior is leading to increased ghosting, as\nwould-be job seekers apply to positions they have no intention of really\ntaking. In turn, recruiters are having to be more stringent in how they\u2019re\nwinnowing down the applicants they get.\n\nBot, meet bot.\n\n## An already infuriating process, but now faster, and with more spam!\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the process of finding a job has long been\nbad.\n\nFuller, the Harvard Business School professor, said hiring practices have\nalways privileged people with the same experience as the job they wanted. In\nother words, if you already were a tech project manager you\u2019re more likely to\nbe hired as a tech project manager, creating an infuriating cycle. That always\nexcluded those who worked in adjacent industries, those without degrees or\nthose who only had germane life experience, say someone who was in the Air\nForce who maintained jet aircraft applying to work at a repair depot for\ntrucks.\n\n\u201cUsually what companies are doing is automating the decision rules that they\nhave in their head or they followed back in the day when they were opening\nmailed-in resumes with letter openers,\u201d Fuller told Sherwood. \u201cA lot of the\nproblems are baked in before anyone even starts using AI.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy supercharging the process with AI, of course, there\u2019s the potential for a\nlot more of the same. AI hiring boosters hope it can mean something different\nand better.\n\n\u201cA lot of the problems are baked in before anyone even starts using AI.\u201d\n\nFuller suggested using AI to pinpoint other experiences and skills that people\nhave that might make them good \u2014 if not traditional \u2014 fits for certain jobs.\nThat would give employers a larger pool of candidates than those with a\nspecific degree or the exact job experience.\n\nIn turn, AI tools can show candidates what they\u2019re missing compared with other\npeople applying for the role, so they can try and gain that experience, apply\nmore selectively or make the case as to why they already fit.\n\nOne of the primary ways iCIMS is using AI is to help match candidates and\ncompanies \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 in a more expansive way than they might have on\ntheir own.\n\nIf a job seeker uploads their resume to one of the many company websites that\nuse the software, it directs them to appropriate jobs based not only on what\nthey have listed explicitly in their resume but also on skills it infers they\nhave but might not have noted.\n\n\u201cBecause we have looked at hundreds of thousands if not millions of candidates\nwith similar backgrounds, similar experiences in similar industries with\nsimilar titles, we know that if you tell us that you have three skills, you\nprobably have the fourth and the fifth one as well,\u201d Andreea Wade, VP of\nproduct strategy at iCIMS, said. \u201cPeople are not great at building their CVs.\u201d\n\nWade sees AI as a marked improvement over older applicant tracking systems\nwhere users would simply use keywords to screen out candidates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cApplicant tracking systems that had zero intelligence in them were screening\ncandidates out, because maybe some keywords did not exist there,\u201d Wade said.\n\u201cSo we literally had technology that did not work.\u201d\n\nGetty\n\nOne of the major themes that arose from talking to job candidates using AI was\nthe desire to \u201cbeat the applicant tracking system\u201d \u2014 a foggy idea of how to\nfight the unseen forces, presumably AI, keeping them from getting interviews.\n\nJefferson Stovall, a public affairs executive, became so enamored with gen AI\ntools during his own job search that rather than getting a job he started a\nconsultancy, Captain Tomorrow, to bring tech like gen AI to public sector\ncommunications. One prompt he\u2019s fond of: feeding the gen AI the company and\njob description and then telling it to act like an applicant tracking system\nand surface the keywords most important for his resume and cover letter.\n\nBrent Hametner, a marketing manager, uses gen AI to come up with custom demand\ngeneration strategy proposals for the companies he\u2019s applying for \u2014 a request\nhe says usually comes later in the interview process \u2014 to set himself apart\nfrom a lot of other applicants by going above and beyond what the initial\napplications require. He said he\u2019s getting interviews from roughly 20% of his\napplications and is hoping to close in on a job soon.\n\nA teacher we spoke with who is trying to transition out of education has been\nusing ChatGPT and other AI software to apply to approximately 50 jobs in the\npast few months. He said it\u2019s made writing cover letters drastically easier.\n\n\u201cAI just articulates it better,\u201d he said, asking us not to use his name so it\ndoesn\u2019t affect his job search. He also credits AI with his \u201ccognitive\nawakening,\u201d teaching him to speak better and parse information more quickly.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not gotten him very far on the job front, but that might have\nto do more with companies\u2019 willingness to accept people without specific job\nexperience rather than the strength of his cover letter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou could tell they're using AI to generate the thank you but no thank you\nletter.\u201d\n\n## The end result: some parts of job process is going analog again.\n\nWhile we wait for AI to go from more to better, AI fatigue is setting in. It\u2019s\nleft both employers and job seekers alike thirsty for a human touch.\n\nAs job emails and messages on job sites become increasingly cluttered and\nfilled with spam and as more and more people pump resumes into what seems like\na black hole, candidates and companies are going old-school. They\u2019re reaching\nout to people through mutual contacts, meeting up in person, and asking for\nemployee referrals. They\u2019re networking.\n\n\u201cAny fool who can\u2019t read, write or spell can now write a perfect cover\nletter.\u201d\n\n\u201cCandidates are going to try to find employers through warm contacts and\nemployers that put in an effort beyond just posting a job posting online, who\nreach out to them to create a human connection,\u201d Atta Tarki, author of\nEvidence-Based Recruiting, said.\n\nHe likened the situation to how some people, tired of dating apps, are trying\ntheir luck at bars and in speed dating.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of my young friends nowadays don't like using online dating\ncommunities because they feel like it just brings along a lot of flakiness,\u201d\nTarki said.\n\nEmployers are feeling the pain of AI too, making them seek out in-person or\nvideo conversations and find ways to make sure people are who \u2014 and as\ntalented as \u2014 they say they are.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs a result of the reduced signal accuracy of a resume or a cover letter \u2014\nthe fact that any fool who can't read, write or spell can now write a perfect\ncover letter or a good enough cover letter \u2014 it makes it difficult for\nemployers to weed out the weakest candidates,\u201d ZipRecrutier Chief Economist\nJulia Pollak told Sherwood.\n\nThat\u2019s meant more timed and recorded hiring assessments, as well as investment\nin products by companies like ZipRecruiter to make it easier and faster to\nhave face to face connections\n\nIn short the rise of AI in the job search process has meant a corresponding\nrise in efforts to prove you\u2019re not AI.\n\n### More Culture\n\nSee all Culture\n\nTom Jones, David Crowther\n\n4/19/24\n\nThe data doesn\u2019t lie: Taylor Swift is the biggest pop star on the planet\n\n4/18/24\n\n## Frozen Dead Guys\n\n### The audacious and expensive world of cryogenics\n\nJamie Wilde\n\nAmerican sales of Docs have dropped\n\nTom Jones, David Crowther4/17/24\n\n4/17/24\n\n## The Justice Department is set to sue Live Nation after Ticketmaster\u2019s bad\nblood\n\nRebecca Moretti\n\nRead\n\nAllegra Rosenberg\n\n4/15/24\n\nPage Turner\n\n##\n\nFan\n\nfic\n\nbook\n\nboom\n\n### \u201cThere is just a really bright voice that comes from fan fiction.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Latest Stories\n\nWalt Hickey\n\n18h\n\n## When the chips are down\n\nSuper Micro Computer, which produces the kind of servers fueling the AI boom,\ndeclined to pre-announce earnings.
