A paper published in Harvard\nEnvironmental Law Review last week argues that fossil fuel companies have been\n\u201ckilling members of the public at an accelerating rate.\u201d It says that oil\ngiants\u2019 awareness that their pollution could have lethal consequences solidly\nfits within the definition of homicide, which, in its basic form, is causing\ndeath with a \u201cculpable mental state.\u201d In other words, the case can be made\nthat oil companies knew what they were doing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sparking a lot of conversation,\u201d said Aaron Regunberg, senior policy\ncounsel at the advocacy group Public Citizen. After discussing the idea with\nelected officials and prosecutors, Regunberg said, many of them have moved\nfrom \u201c\u2018Oh, that\u2019s crazy\u2019 to \u2018Oh, that makes sense.\u2019\u201d\n\nStarting around the 1970s, oil companies like Exxon understood the dangers\nthat burning fossil fuels would unleash \u2014 unprecedented warming that would\nrender parts of the globe \u201cless habitable,\u201d submerge coastal cities, and lead\nto extensive drought and mass famine. Yet instead of switching away from coal\nand oil, they doubled down, working to block legislation to reduce greenhouse\ngas emissions and spreading doubt about the science of climate change. Today,\nwith atmospheric CO2 climbing to levels last seen 14 million years ago, the\npredicted consequences have begun to arrive. Since the start of the 21st\ncentury, climate change has killed roughly 4 million people, according to one\nconservative estimate.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nBy 2100, that same number of people could be killed by the effects of climate\nchange every single year, according to the new paper by David Arkush, the\ndirector of Public Citizen\u2019s climate program, and Donald Braman, a law\nprofessor at George Washington University. \u201c[T]he scope of the lethality is so\nvast that, in the annals of crime, it may eventually dwarf all other homicide\ncases in the United States, combined,\u201d they write.\n\nCriminal law cases are normally brought against individuals, but Regunberg\nsays there\u2019s a strong case for applying it more broadly. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be\nabout protecting us from dangerous actors that would harm our communities.\nWhat if we actually use this system to protect us from dangerous corporate\nactors that are doing incomprehensible harm?\u201d\n\nHomicide opens up a new flank in the strategy to bring climate change into the\ncourts. Climate litigation is now in its \u201cthird wave,\u201d according to Anthony\nMoffa, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law. The first\nlawsuits sought to force power companies to limit their emissions by way of\nfederal public nuisance claims, a strategy the Supreme Court shot down in\n2011. Then people started suing the U.S. and state governments using the\nargument that they had a duty to protect their citizens from climate change.\nThe approach bore fruit last year, when young climate activists won a suit\nagainst Montana that claimed the state\u2019s failure to evaluate climate risks in\napproving fossil fuel projects violated their constitutional right to a\nhealthy environment.\n\nThat phase also includes a flood of climate lawsuits filed against oil\ncompanies in state courts using laws meant to protect people from deceptive\nadvertising, and those cases are finally moving closer to trial after years of\ndelays. Now the strategy has expanded to include racketeering lawsuits, which\nuse the laws that took down the Mafia against Big Oil, and potentially\ncriminal law cases including homicide or reckless endangerment.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nArkush and Braman\u2019s paper suggests that all types of homicide are on the table\nexcept for first-degree murder, which requires premeditated intent. One option\nis \u201cinvoluntary manslaughter,\u201d or engaging in reckless conduct that causes\ndeath, even if it\u2019s unintentional. \u201cNegligent homicide\u201d is similar, but for\nneglectful behavior. There\u2019s also \u201cdepraved heart murder,\u201d which requires\nengaging in conduct where you knew there was a substantial risk someone would\nbe killed. Other variants include \u201cfelony murder\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanor\nmanslaughter.\u201d Criminal law differs between states, so an attorney general or\ndistrict attorney\u2019s approach would depend on the jurisdiction.\n\nHomicide suits could be a powerful force for holding oil companies accountable\nand forcing them to change their polluting ways. \u201cWhere tort law merely prices\nharmful conduct, criminal law prohibits it \u2014 and provides tools to stop it,\u201d\nArkush and Braman wrote in the Harvard Environmental Law Review paper. A\nsuccessful lawsuit could result in courts requiring fossil fuel companies to\nrestructure as \u201cpublic benefit corporations\u201d that have to balance profits with\na commitment to the public good, replace their boards with new members, or\nmake legally binding commitments to forgo certain practices.\n\nTo promote the idea of \u201cclimate homicide,\u201d Public Citizen has been organizing\npanel discussions in recent weeks at law schools including Yale, Harvard, the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, New York University, and the University of\nChicago. Another panel will be held at Vermont Law School on Monday. Public\nCitizen is also looking into staging mock trials to see how jurors might react\nto these kinds of cases and what evidence they find compelling.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of prosecutorial offices that seem interested in giving\nthese legal theories serious consideration,\u201d Regunberg said. \u201cThey understand\nthat climate disasters \u2014 extreme heat, wildfires, floods, and more \u2014 are\nendangering their communities, and if there\u2019s a way to stop criminally\nreckless conduct that\u2019s contributing to these threats, they\u2019re going to\nexplore that possibility.\u201d\n\nThe idea has been embraced by Sharon Eubanks, who led the United States\u2019\nracketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies in 2005, in which the court\nfound that companies had conspired to deceive the public by covering up the\nhealth dangers of smoking. \u201cThere were a lot of people who said we were crazy\nto charge big tobacco with racketeering and that we could never win,\u201d Eubanks\ntold The Guardian. \u201cBut you know what? We did win. I think we need that same\nkind of thinking to deal with the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nSo why has no one seriously considered suing oil companies for homicide until\nnow? Recent years have brought advances in the science that connects climate\nchange to extreme weather events and quantifies how corporate emissions have\nfueled disasters like wildfires, paving the way for these types of cases.\nStill, the need to include attribution science adds a layer of complexity that\nhasn\u2019t been present for similar litigation against tobacco or opioid\ncompanies, according to Moffa.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the fact that prosecutors are reluctant to take corporations\nto court with criminal law charges. The first time that a corporation was\ncharged under a criminal statute for manslaughter was in 1904, when a\nsteamship owner was found guilty after its ship caught fire and 900 passengers\ndrowned, but the legal strategy never really took off. \u201cSo then to say, \u2018Why\nhaven\u2019t they ever done this in the environmental law?\u2019 They haven\u2019t really\ndone it in almost any context,\u201d Moffa said.\n\nIn their paper, Arkush and Braman argued that fossil fuel companies have been\nacting as if they were above the law. \u201cUnder a plain reading of the law in\njurisdictions across the United States, they are committing mass homicide,\u201d\nthey conclude. \u201cProsecutors should act accordingly.\u201d\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
