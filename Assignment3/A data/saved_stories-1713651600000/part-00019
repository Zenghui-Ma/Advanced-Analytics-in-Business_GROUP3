For other uses, see Mond.\n\nModified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a hypothesis that proposes a\nmodification of Newton's second law to account for observed properties of\ngalaxies. It is supported by a minority of astrophysicists as an alternative\nto the more widely accepted hypothesis of dark matter in terms of explaining\nwhy galaxies do not appear to obey the currently understood laws of\nphysics.^[1]\n\nCreated in 1982 and first published in 1983 by Israeli physicist Mordehai\nMilgrom,^[2] the hypothesis' original motivation was to explain why the\nvelocities of stars in galaxies were observed to be larger than expected based\non Newtonian mechanics. Milgrom noted that this discrepancy could be resolved\nif the gravitational force experienced by a star in the outer regions of a\ngalaxy was proportional to the square of its centripetal acceleration (as\nopposed to the centripetal acceleration itself, as in Newton's second law) or\nalternatively, if gravitational force varied inversely with the radius\ndirectly (as opposed to with the inverse square of the radius, as in Newton's\nlaw of gravity). MOND departs from Newton's laws at extremely small\naccelerations (for instance, far from any sources of gravitational field).\nSuch low accelerations are characteristic of the outer regions of galaxies, or\nthe inter-galaxy forces within galaxy clusters, but are far below anything\nencountered in the Solar System or on Earth.^[3]^[dubious \u2013 discuss]\n\nUnsolved problem in physics:\n\n  * What is the nature of dark matter? Is it a particle, or do the phenomena attributed to dark matter actually require a modification of the laws of gravity?\n\n(more unsolved problems in physics)\n\nMOND is an example of a class of theories known as modified gravity, and is an\nalternative to the hypothesis that the dynamics of galaxies are determined by\nmassive, invisible dark matter halos. Since Milgrom's original proposal,\nproponents of MOND have claimed to successfully predict a variety of galactic\nphenomena that they state are difficult to understand as consequences of dark\nmatter.^[4]^[5]\n\nThough MOND explains the anomalously great rotational velocities of galaxies\nat their perimeters, it does not fully explain the velocity dispersions of\nindividual galaxies within galaxy clusters. MOND reduces the discrepancy\nbetween the velocity dispersions and clusters' observed missing baryonic mass\nfrom a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2. However, the residual\ndiscrepancy cannot be accounted for by MOND, requiring that other explanations\nclose the gap such as the presence of as-yet undetected missing baryonic\nmatter.^[6]\n\nThe accurate measurement of the speed of gravitational waves compared to the\nspeed of light in 2017 ruled out a certain class of modified gravity theories\nbut concluded that other MOND theories that dispense with the need for dark\nmatter remained viable.^[7] Two years later, theories put forth by\nConstantinos Skordis and Tom Zlosnik were consistent with gravitational waves\nthat always travel at the speed of light. Later still in 2021, Skordis and\nZlosnik developed a subclass of their theory called \"RMOND\", for \"relativistic\nMOND\", which had \"been shown to reproduce in great detail the main\nobservations in cosmology, including the cosmic-microwave-background power\nspectrum, and the matter structure power spectrum.\"^[6]^[8]\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Comparison of the observed and expected rotation curves of the\ntypical spiral galaxy M33^[9]\n\nSeveral independent observations point to the fact that the visible mass in\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters is insufficient to account for their dynamics,\nwhen analyzed using Newton's laws. This discrepancy \u2013 known as the \"missing\nmass problem\" \u2013 was first identified for clusters by Swiss astronomer Fritz\nZwicky in 1933 (who studied the Coma cluster),^[10]^[11] and subsequently\nextended to include spiral galaxies by the 1939 work of Horace Babcock on\nAndromeda.^[12]\n\nThese early studies were augmented and brought to the attention of the\nastronomical community in the 1960s and 1970s by the work of Vera Rubin at the\nCarnegie Institute in Washington, who mapped in detail the rotation velocities\nof stars in a large sample of spirals. While Newton's Laws predict that\nstellar rotation velocities should decrease with distance from the galactic\ncentre, Rubin and collaborators found instead that they remain almost\nconstant^[13] \u2013 the rotation curves are said to be \"flat\". This observation\nnecessitates at least one of the following:\n\n    (1)| There exists in galaxies large quantities of unseen matter which boosts the stars' velocities beyond what would be expected on the basis of the visible mass alone, or  \n---|---  \n(2)| Newton's Laws do not apply to galaxies.  \n  \nOption (1) leads to the dark matter hypothesis; option (2) leads to MOND.\n\nMOND was proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983\n\nThe basic premise of MOND is that while Newton's laws have been extensively\ntested in high-acceleration environments (in the Solar System and on Earth),\nthey have not been verified for objects with extremely low acceleration, such\nas stars in the outer parts of galaxies. This led Milgrom to postulate a new\neffective gravitational force law (sometimes referred to as \"Milgrom's law\")\nthat relates the true acceleration of an object to the acceleration that would\nbe predicted for it on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.^[2] This law, the\nkeystone of MOND, is chosen to reproduce the Newtonian result at high\nacceleration but leads to different (\"deep-MOND\") behavior at low\nacceleration:\n\n    \n\n    (1)  \n---  \n  \nHere F_N is the Newtonian force, m is the object's (gravitational) mass, a is\nits acceleration, \u03bc(x) is an as-yet unspecified function (called the\ninterpolating function), and a_0 is a new fundamental constant which marks the\ntransition between the Newtonian and deep-MOND regimes. Agreement with\nNewtonian mechanics requires\n\nand consistency with astronomical observations requires\n\nBeyond these limits, the interpolating function is not specified by the\nhypothesis, although it is possible to weakly constrain it\nempirically.^[14]^[15] Two common choices are the \"simple interpolating\nfunction\":\n\nand the \"standard interpolating function\":\n\nThus, in the deep-MOND regime (a \u226a a_0):\n\nApplying this to a star or other object of mass m in circular orbit around\nmass M (the total baryonic mass of the galaxy), produces\n\n    \n\n    (2)  \n---  \n  \nBy fitting his law to rotation curve data, Milgrom found a_0 \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 10^\u221210\nm/s^2 to be optimal.\n\nMOND holds that for accelerations smaller than an a_0 value of roughly 1.2 \u00d7\n10^\u221210 m/s^2, accelerations increasingly depart from the standard M \u00b7 G / r ^2\nNewtonian relationship of mass and distance, wherein gravitational strength is\nproportional to mass and the inverse square of distance. Specifically, the\ntheory holds that when gravity is well below the a_0 value, its rate of\nchange\u2014including the curvature of spacetime\u2014increases with the square root of\nmass (rather than linearly as per Newtonian law) and decreases linearly with\ndistance (rather than distance squared).\n\nWhenever a small mass, m is near a much larger mass, M, whether it be a star\nnear the center of a galaxy or an object near or on Earth, MOND yields\ndynamics that are indistinguishably close to those of Newtonian gravity. This\n1-to-1 correspondence between MOND and Newtonian dynamics is retained down to\naccelerations of about 1.2 \u00d7 10^\u221210 m/s^2 (the a_0 value); as accelerations\ndecline below a_0, MOND's dynamics rapidly diverge from the Newtonian\ndescription of gravity. For instance, there is a certain distance from the\ncenter of any given galaxy at which its gravitational acceleration equals a_0;\nat ten times that distance, Newtonian gravity predicts a hundredfold decline\nin gravity whereas MOND predicts only a tenfold reduction.\n\nIt is important to note that the Newtonian component of MOND's dynamics\nremains active at accelerations well below the a_0 value of 1.2 \u00d7 10^\u221210\nm/s^2; the equations of MOND assert no minimum acceleration for the Newtonian\ncomponent. However, because the residual Newtonian-like dynamics of MOND\ncontinue to decline as the inverse square of distance below a_0\u2014just as they\ndo above\u2014they comparatively vanish as they become overwhelmed by the stronger\n\u201cdeep-MOND\u201d linear dynamics of the theory.\n\nMOND predicts stellar velocities that closely match observations for an\nextraordinarily wide range of distances from galactic centers of mass. The 1.2\n\u00d7 10^\u221210 magnitude of a_0 establishes not only the distance from the center of\nthe galaxy at which Newtonian and MOND dynamics diverge, but a_0 also\nestablishes the angle (when not plotted with log/log scales) of the non-\nNewtonian linear slope on velocity/radius graphs like Fig. 1.\n\nMOND-compliant gravity, which explains galactic-scale observations, was not\npreviously detected closer to Earth, such as in national laboratories or the\ntrajectories of interplanetary spacecraft, because the a_0 acceleration, 1.2 \u00d7\n10^\u221210 m/s^2, at which the dynamics of MOND begin diverging from Newtonian\ndynamics, is\u2014as a practical matter\u2014indistinguishably close to perfect\nweightlessness. Within the Solar System, the v^ 4 = GMa_0 equation makes the\neffect of the a_0 term virtually nonexistent; it is overwhelmed by the\nenormous\u2014and highly Newtonian\u2014gravitational influence of the Sun as well as\nthe variability of Earth's surface gravity.\n\nOn Earth's surface\u2014and in national laboratories when performing ultra-precise\ngravimetry\u2014the a_0 value is equal to 0.012 microgal (\u03bcGal), which is only\ntwelve-trillionths the strength of Earth's gravity. A change in the laws of\ngravity below this acceleration is far too small to be resolved with even the\nmost sensitive free-fall-style absolute gravimeters available to national\nlabs, like the FG5-X, which is accurate to just \u00b12 \u03bcGal. When considering why\nMOND's effects aren't detectable with precision gravimetry on Earth, it is\nimportant to remember that a_0 doesn't represent a spurious force; it is the\ngravitational strength at which MOND is theorized to significantly begin\ndeparting from the Newtonian dynamic. Moreover, the a_0 strength is equivalent\nto the change in Earth's gravity brought about by an elevation difference of\n0.04 mm\u2014the width of a fine human hair. Such subtle gravitational details,\nbesides being unresolvable with current gravimeters, are overwhelmed by twice-\ndaily distortions in Earth's shape due to lunar gravitational tides, which can\ncause local elevation changes nearly 10,000 times greater than 0.04 mm. Such\ndisturbances in local gravity due to tidal distortions are even detectable as\nvariations in the rate of a Shortt double-pendulum clock, which was a national\ntimekeeping standard in the late 1920s.\n\nEven at the edge of the Solar System, the a_0 point at which MOND dynamics\nsignificantly diverge from Newtonian dynamics is overwhelmed and masked by the\nmuch stronger gravitational fields from the Sun and planets, which follow\nNewtonian gravity. To give a sense of scale to a_0, a free-floating mass in\nspace that was exposed for one hour to 1.2 \u00d7 10^\u221210 m/s^2 would \"fall\" by just\n0.8 millimeter\u2014roughly the thickness of a credit card. An interplanetary\nspacecraft on a free-flying inertial path well above the Solar System's\necliptic plane (where it is isolated from the gravitational influence of\nindividual planets) would, when at the same distance from the Sun as Neptune,\nexperience a classic Newtonian gravitational strength that is 55,000 times\nstronger than a_0. For small Solar System asteroids, gravitational effects in\nthe realm of a_0 are comparable in magnitude to the Yarkovsky effect, which\nsubtly perturbs their orbits over long periods due to momentum transfer from\nthe non-symmetric emission of thermal photons. The Sun's contribution to\ninterstellar galactic gravity doesn't decline to the a_0 threshold at which\nMOND's effects predominate until objects are 41 light-days from the Sun; this\nis 53 times further away from the Sun than Voyager 2 was in November 2022,\nwhich has been in the interstellar medium since 2012.\n\nDespite its vanishingly small and undetectable effects on bodies that are on\nEarth, within the Solar System, and even in proximity to the Solar System and\nother planetary systems, MOND successfully explains significant observed\ngalactic-scale rotational effects without invoking the existence of as-yet\nundetected dark matter particles lying outside of the highly successful\nStandard Model of particle physics. This is in large part due to MOND holding\nthat exceedingly weak galactic-scale gravity holding galaxies together near\ntheir perimeters declines as a very slow linear relationship to distance from\nthe center of a galaxy rather than declining as the inverse square of\ndistance.\n\nMilgrom's law can be interpreted in two ways:\n\n  * One possibility is to treat it as a modification to Newton's second law, so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle's acceleration a but rather to In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other forces, for example electromagnetism.^[16]\n  * Alternatively, Milgrom's law can be viewed as leaving Newton's Second Law intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass m due to another of mass M is roughly of the form In this interpretation, Milgrom's modification would apply exclusively to gravitational phenomena.\n\nBy itself, Milgrom's law is not a complete and self-contained physical theory,\nbut rather an ad hoc empirically motivated variant of one of the several\nequations that constitute classical mechanics. Its status within a coherent\nnon-relativistic hypothesis of MOND is akin to Kepler's Third Law within\nNewtonian mechanics; it provides a succinct description of observational\nfacts, but must itself be explained by more fundamental concepts situated\nwithin the underlying hypothesis. Several complete classical hypotheses have\nbeen proposed (typically along \"modified gravity\" as opposed to \"modified\ninertia\" lines), which generally yield Milgrom's law exactly in situations of\nhigh symmetry and otherwise deviate from it slightly. A subset of these non-\nrelativistic hypotheses have been further embedded within relativistic\ntheories, which are capable of making contact with non-classical phenomena\n(e.g., gravitational lensing) and cosmology.^[17] Distinguishing both\ntheoretically and observationally between these alternatives is a subject of\ncurrent research.\n\nThe majority of astronomers, astrophysicists, and cosmologists accept dark\nmatter as the explanation for galactic rotation curves (based on general\nrelativity, and hence Newtonian mechanics), and are committed to a dark matter\nsolution of the missing-mass problem.^[18] The primary difference between\nsupporters of \u039bCDM and MOND is in the observations for which they demand a\nrobust, quantitative explanation, and those for which they are satisfied with\na qualitative account, or are prepared to leave for future work. Proponents of\nMOND emphasize predictions made on galaxy scales (where MOND enjoys its most\nnotable successes) and believe that a cosmological model consistent with\ngalaxy dynamics has yet to be discovered. Proponents of \u039bCDM require high\nlevels of cosmological accuracy (which concordance cosmology provides) and\nargue that a resolution of galaxy-scale issues will follow from a better\nunderstanding of the complicated baryonic astrophysics underlying galaxy\nformation.^[4]^[19]\n\n## Observational evidence for MOND[edit]\n\nSince MOND was specifically designed to produce flat rotation curves, these do\nnot constitute evidence for the hypothesis, but every matching observation\nadds to support of the empirical law. Nevertheless, proponents claim that a\nbroad range of astrophysical phenomena at the galactic scale are neatly\naccounted for within the MOND framework.^[17]^[20] Many of these came to light\nafter the publication of Milgrom's original papers and are difficult to\nexplain using the dark matter hypothesis. The most prominent are the\nfollowing:\n\n  * In addition to demonstrating that rotation curves in MOND are flat, equation 2 provides a concrete relation between a galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas) and its asymptotic rotation velocity. This predicted relation was called by Milgrom the mass-asymptotic speed relation (MASSR); its observational manifestation is known as the baryonic Tully\u2013Fisher relation (BTFR),^[21] and is found to conform quite closely to the MOND prediction.^[22]\n  * Milgrom's law fully specifies the rotation curve of a galaxy given only the distribution of its baryonic mass. In particular, MOND predicts a far stronger correlation between features in the baryonic mass distribution and features in the rotation curve than does the dark matter hypothesis (since dark matter dominates the galaxy's mass budget and is conventionally assumed not to closely track the distribution of baryons). Such a tight correlation is claimed to be observed in several spiral galaxies, a fact which has been referred to as \"Renzo's rule\".^[17]\n  * Since MOND modifies Newtonian dynamics in an acceleration-dependent way, it predicts a specific relationship between the acceleration of a star at any radius from the centre of a galaxy and the amount of unseen (dark matter) mass within that radius that would be inferred in a Newtonian analysis. This is known as the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation, and has been measured observationally.^[23]^[24] One aspect of the MOND prediction is that the mass of the inferred dark matter goes to zero when the stellar centripetal acceleration becomes greater than a_0, where MOND reverts to Newtonian mechanics. In a dark matter hypothesis, it is a challenge to understand why this mass should correlate so closely with acceleration, and why there appears to be a critical acceleration above which dark matter is not required.^[4]\n  * Both MOND and dark matter halos stabilize disk galaxies, helping them retain their rotation-supported structure and preventing their transformation into elliptical galaxies. In MOND, this added stability is only available for regions of galaxies within the deep-MOND regime (i.e., with a < a_0), suggesting that spirals with a > a_0 in their central regions should be prone to instabilities and hence less likely to survive to the present day.^[25] This may explain the \"Freeman limit\" to the observed central surface mass density of spiral galaxies, which is roughly a_0/G.^[26] This scale must be put in by hand in dark matter-based galaxy formation models.^[27]\n  * Particularly massive galaxies are within the Newtonian regime (a > a_0) out to radii enclosing the vast majority of their baryonic mass. At these radii, MOND predicts that the rotation curve should fall as 1/r, in accordance with Kepler's Laws. In contrast, from a dark matter perspective one would expect the halo to significantly boost the rotation velocity and cause it to asymptote to a constant value, as in less massive galaxies. Observations of high-mass ellipticals bear out the MOND prediction.^[28]^[29]\n  * In MOND, all gravitationally bound objects with a < a_0 \u2013 regardless of their origin \u2013 should exhibit a mass discrepancy when analyzed using Newtonian mechanics, and should lie on the BTFR. Under the dark matter hypothesis, objects formed from baryonic material ejected during the merger or tidal interaction of two galaxies (\"tidal dwarf galaxies\") are expected to be devoid of dark matter and hence show no mass discrepancy. Three objects unambiguously identified as Tidal Dwarf Galaxies appear to have mass discrepancies in close agreement with the MOND prediction.^[30]^[31]^[32]\n  * Recent work has shown that many of the dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way and Andromeda are located preferentially in a single plane and have correlated motions. This suggests that they may have formed during a close encounter with another galaxy and hence be Tidal Dwarf Galaxies. If so, the presence of mass discrepancies in these systems constitutes evidence for MOND. In addition, it has been claimed that a gravitational force stronger than Newton's (such as Milgrom's) is required for these galaxies to retain their orbits over time.^[33]\n  * In 2020, a group of astronomers analyzing data from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) sample together with estimates of the large-scale external gravitational field from an all-sky galaxy catalog, concluded that there was highly statistically significant evidence of violations of the strong equivalence principle in weak gravitational fields in the vicinity of rotationally supported galaxies.^[34] They observed an effect consistent with the external field effect of modified Newtonian dynamics and inconsistent with tidal effects in the Lambda-CDM model paradigm commonly known as the Standard Model of Cosmology.\n  * In a 2022 published survey of dwarf galaxies from the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) catalogue, a group of astronomers and physicists conclude that 'observed deformations of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster and the lack of low surface brightness dwarfs towards its centre are incompatible with \u039bCDM expectations but well consistent with MOND.'^[35]\n  * In 2022, Kroupa et al. published a study of open star clusters, arguing that asymmetry in the population of leading and trailing tidal tails, and the observed lifetime of these clusters, are inconsistent with Newtonian dynamics but consistent with MOND.^[36]^[37]\n  * In 2023, a study claimed that cold dark matter cannot explain galactic rotation curves, while MOND can.^[38]\n  * In 2023, a study measured the acceleration of 26,615 wide binaries within 200 parsecs. The study showed that those binaries with accelerations less than 1 nanometer per second squared systematically deviate from Newtonian dynamics, but conform to MOND predictions, specifically to AQUAL.^[39] The results are disputed, with some authors arguing that the detection is caused by poor quality controls,^[40] while the original authors claimed that the added quality controls do not significantly affect the results.^[41]\n\n## Complete MOND hypotheses[edit]\n\nMilgrom's law requires incorporation into a complete hypothesis if it is to\nsatisfy conservation laws and provide a unique solution for the time evolution\nof any physical system. Each of the theories described here reduce to\nMilgrom's law in situations of high symmetry (and thus enjoy the successes\ndescribed above), but produce different behavior in detail.\n\n### Nonrelativistic[edit]\n\nThe first hypothesis of MOND (dubbed AQUAL) was constructed in 1984 by Milgrom\nand Jacob Bekenstein.^[42] AQUAL generates MONDian behavior by modifying the\ngravitational term in the classical Lagrangian from being quadratic in the\ngradient of the Newtonian potential to a more general function. (AQUAL is an\nacronym for A QUAdratic Lagrangian.) In formulae:\n\nwhere is the standard Newtonian gravitational potential and F is a new\ndimensionless function. Applying the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations in the standard\nway then leads to a non-linear generalization of the Newton\u2013Poisson equation:\n\nThis can be solved given suitable boundary conditions and choice of F to yield\nMilgrom's law (up to a curl field correction which vanishes in situations of\nhigh symmetry).\n\nAn alternative way to modify the gravitational term in the lagrangian is to\nintroduce a distinction between the true (MONDian) acceleration field a and\nthe Newtonian acceleration field a_N. The Lagrangian may be constructed so\nthat a_N satisfies the usual Newton-Poisson equation, and is then used to find\na via an additional algebraic but non-linear step, which is chosen to satisfy\nMilgrom's law. This is called the \"quasi-linear formulation of MOND\", or\nQUMOND,^[43] and is particularly useful for calculating the distribution of\n\"phantom\" dark matter that would be inferred from a Newtonian analysis of a\ngiven physical situation.^[17]\n\nBoth AQUAL and QUMOND propose changes to the gravitational part of the\nclassical matter action, and hence interpret Milgrom's law as a modification\nof Newtonian gravity as opposed to Newton's second law. The alternative is to\nturn the kinetic term of the action into a functional depending on the\ntrajectory of the particle. Such \"modified inertia\" theories, however, are\ndifficult to use because they are time-nonlocal, require energy and momentum\nto be non-trivially redefined to be conserved, and have predictions that\ndepend on the entirety of a particle's orbit.^[17]\n\n### Relativistic[edit]\n\nIn 2004, Jacob Bekenstein formulated TeVeS, the first complete relativistic\nhypothesis using MONDian behaviour.^[44] TeVeS is constructed from a local\nLagrangian (and hence respects conservation laws), and employs a unit vector\nfield, a dynamical and non-dynamical scalar field, a free function and a non-\nEinsteinian metric in order to yield AQUAL in the non-relativistic limit (low\nspeeds and weak gravity). TeVeS has enjoyed some success in making contact\nwith gravitational lensing and structure formation observations,^[45] but\nfaces problems when confronted with data on the anisotropy of the cosmic\nmicrowave background,^[46] the lifetime of compact objects,^[47] and the\nrelationship between the lensing and matter overdensity potentials.^[48]\n\nSeveral alternative relativistic generalizations of MOND exist, including\nBIMOND and generalized Einstein aether theory.^[17] There is also a\nrelativistic generalization of MOND that assumes a Lorentz-type invariance as\nthe physical basis of MOND phenomenology.^[49]\n\n## External field effect[edit]\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, an object's acceleration can be found as the vector\nsum of the acceleration due to each of the individual forces acting on it.\nThis means that a subsystem can be decoupled from the larger system in which\nit is embedded simply by referring the motion of its constituent particles to\ntheir centre of mass; in other words, the influence of the larger system is\nirrelevant for the internal dynamics of the subsystem. Since Milgrom's law is\nnon-linear in acceleration, MONDian subsystems cannot be decoupled from their\nenvironment in this way, and in certain situations this leads to behaviour\nwith no Newtonian parallel. This is known as the \"external field effect\"\n(EFE),^[2] for which there exists observational evidence.^[34]\n\nThe external field effect is best described by classifying physical systems\naccording to their relative values of a_in (the characteristic acceleration of\none object within a subsystem due to the influence of another), a_ex (the\nacceleration of the entire subsystem due to forces exerted by objects outside\nof it), and a_0:\n\n  * : Newtonian regime\n  * : Deep-MOND regime\n  * : The external field is dominant and the behavior of the system is Newtonian.\n  * : The external field is larger than the internal acceleration of the system, but both are smaller than the critical value. In this case, dynamics is Newtonian but the effective value of G is enhanced by a factor of a_0/a_ex.^[50]\n\nThe external field effect implies a fundamental break with the strong\nequivalence principle (but not necessarily the weak equivalence principle).\nThe effect was postulated by Milgrom in the first of his 1983 papers to\nexplain why some open clusters were observed to have no mass discrepancy even\nthough their internal accelerations were below a_0. It has since come to be\nrecognized as a crucial element of the MOND paradigm.\n\nThe dependence in MOND of the internal dynamics of a system on its external\nenvironment (in principle, the rest of the universe) is strongly reminiscent\nof Mach's principle, and may hint towards a more fundamental structure\nunderlying Milgrom's law. In this regard, Milgrom has commented:^[51]\n\n> It has been long suspected that local dynamics is strongly influenced by the\n> universe at large, a-la Mach's principle, but MOND seems to be the first to\n> supply concrete evidence for such a connection. This may turn out to be the\n> most fundamental implication of MOND, beyond its implied modification of\n> Newtonian dynamics and general relativity, and beyond the elimination of\n> dark matter.\n\nIndeed, the potential link between MONDian dynamics and the universe as a\nwhole (that is, cosmology) is augmented by the observation that the value of\na_0 (determined by fits to internal properties of galaxies) is within an order\nof magnitude of cH_0, where c is the speed of light and H_0 is the Hubble\nconstant (a measure of the present-day expansion rate of the universe).^[2] It\nis also close to the acceleration rate of the universe, and hence the\ncosmological constant. Recent work on a transactional formulation of Entropic\ngravity by Schlatter and Kastner ^[52] suggests a natural connection between\na_0, H_0, and the cosmological constant.\n\n## Responses and criticism[edit]\n\n### Dark matter explanation[edit]\n\nWhile acknowledging that Milgrom's law provides a succinct and accurate\ndescription of a range of galactic phenomena, many physicists reject the idea\nthat classical dynamics itself needs to be modified and attempt instead to\nexplain the law's success by reference to the behavior of dark matter. Some\neffort has gone towards establishing the presence of a characteristic\nacceleration scale as a natural consequence of the behavior of cold dark\nmatter halos,^[53]^[54] although Milgrom has argued that such arguments\nexplain only a small subset of MOND phenomena.^[55] An alternative proposal is\nto modify the properties of dark matter (e.g., to make it interact strongly\nwith itself or baryons) in order to induce the tight coupling between the\nbaryonic and dark matter mass that the observations point to.^[56] Finally,\nsome researchers suggest that explaining the empirical success of Milgrom's\nlaw requires a more radical break with conventional assumptions about the\nnature of dark matter. One idea (dubbed \"dipolar dark matter\") is to make dark\nmatter gravitationally polarizable by ordinary matter and have this\npolarization enhance the gravitational attraction between baryons.^[57]\n\n### Outstanding problems for MOND[edit]\n\nThe most serious problem facing Milgrom's law is that it cannot eliminate the\nneed for dark matter in all astrophysical systems: galaxy clusters show a\nresidual mass discrepancy even when analyzed using MOND.^[4] The fact that\nsome form of unseen mass must exist in these systems detracts from the\nadequacy of MOND as a solution to the missing mass problem, although the\namount of extra mass required is a fifth that of a Newtonian analysis, and\nthere is no requirement that the missing mass be non-baryonic. It has been\nspeculated that 2 eV neutrinos could account for the cluster observations in\nMOND while preserving the hypothesis's successes at the galaxy\nscale.^[58]^[59] Indeed, analysis of sharp lensing data for the galaxy cluster\nAbell 1689 shows that MOND only becomes distinctive at Mpc distance from the\ncenter, so that Zwicky's conundrum remains,^[60] and 1.8 eV neutrinos are\nneeded in clusters.^[61]\n\nThe 2006 observation of a pair of colliding galaxy clusters known as the\n\"Bullet Cluster\",^[62] poses a significant challenge for all theories\nproposing a modified gravity solution to the missing mass problem, including\nMOND. Astronomers measured the distribution of stellar and gas mass in the\nclusters using visible and X-ray light, respectively, and in addition mapped\nthe inferred dark matter density using gravitational lensing. In MOND, one\nwould expect the \"missing mass\" to be centred on regions of visible mass which\nexperience accelerations lower than a_0 (assuming the external field effect is\nnegligible). In \u039bCDM, on the other hand, one would expect the dark matter to\nbe significantly offset from the visible mass because the halos of the two\ncolliding clusters would pass through each other (assuming, as is\nconventional, that dark matter is collisionless), whilst the cluster gas would\ninteract and end up at the centre. An offset is clearly seen in the\nobservations. It has been suggested, however, that MOND-based models may be\nable to generate such an offset in strongly non-spherically symmetric systems,\nsuch as the Bullet Cluster.^[63]\n\nSome ultra diffuse galaxies, such as NGC 1052-DF2, appear to be free of dark\nmatter. If this is indeed the case, it poses a problem for MOND because it\ncannot explain the rotation curves.^[a] Efforts are under way to show that\neither MOND is capable of reproducing the rotation curves,^[64] or that the\nobservations are incorrect.^[65]\n\nA significant piece of evidence in favor of standard dark matter is the\nobserved anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background.^[66] While \u039bCDM is\nable to explain the observed angular power spectrum, MOND has a much harder\ntime, although it is possible to construct relativistic generalizations of\nMOND that can fit the observations too.^[8] MOND also encounters difficulties\nexplaining structure formation, with density perturbations in MOND perhaps\ngrowing so rapidly that too much structure is formed by the present\nepoch.^[67] However, forming galaxies more rapidly than in \u039bCDM can be a good\nthing to some extent.^[68]\n\nSeveral other studies have noted observational difficulties with MOND. For\nexample, it has been claimed that MOND offers a poor fit to the velocity\ndispersion profile of globular clusters and the temperature profile of galaxy\nclusters,^[69]^[70] that different values of a_0 are required for agreement\nwith different galaxies' rotation curves,^[71] and that MOND is naturally\nunsuited to forming the basis of cosmology.^[72] Furthermore, many versions of\nMOND predict that the speed of light is different from the speed of gravity,\nbut in 2017 the speed of gravitational waves was measured to be equal to the\nspeed of light to high precision.^[7] This is well understood in modern\nrelativistic theories of MOND, with the constraint from gravitational waves\nactually helping by substantially restricting how a covariant theory might be\nconstructed.^[73]\n\nBesides these observational issues, MOND and its relativistic generalizations\nare plagued by theoretical difficulties.^[72]^[74] Several ad hoc and\ninelegant additions to general relativity are required to create a theory\ncompatible with a non-Newtonian non-relativistic limit, though the predictions\nin this limit are rather clear. This is the case for the more commonly used\nmodified gravity versions of MOND, but some formulations (most prominently\nthose based on modified inertia) have long suffered from poor compatibility\nwith cherished physical principles such as conservation laws. Researchers\nworking on MOND generally do not interpret it as a modification of inertia,\nwith only very limited work done on this area.\n\n## Proposals for testing MOND[edit]\n\nSeveral observational and experimental tests have been proposed to help\ndistinguish^[75] between MOND and dark matter-based models:\n\n  * The detection of particles suitable for constituting cosmological dark matter would strongly suggest that \u039bCDM is correct and no modification to Newton's laws is required.\n  * If MOND is taken as a theory of modified inertia, it predicts the existence of anomalous accelerations on the Earth at particular places and times of the year. These could be detected in a precision experiment. This prediction would not hold if MOND is taken as a theory of modified gravity, as the external field effect produced by the Earth would cancel MONDian effects at the Earth's surface.^[76]^[77]\n  * It has been suggested that MOND could be tested in the Solar System using the LISA Pathfinder mission (launched in 2015). In particular, it may be possible to detect the anomalous tidal stresses predicted by MOND to exist at the Earth-Sun saddlepoint of the Newtonian gravitational potential.^[78] It may also be possible to measure MOND corrections to the perihelion precession of the planets in the Solar System,^[79] or a purpose-built spacecraft.^[80]\n  * One potential astrophysical test of MOND is to investigate whether isolated galaxies behave differently from otherwise-identical galaxies that are under the influence of a strong external field. Another is to search for non-Newtonian behaviour in the motion of binary star systems where the stars are sufficiently separated for their accelerations to be below a_0.^[81]\n  * Testing MOND using the redshift-dependence of radial acceleration \u2013 Sabine Hossenfelder and Tobias Mistele propose a parameter-free MOND model they call Covariant Emergent Gravity and suggest that as measurements of radial acceleration improve, various MOND models and particle dark matter might be distinguishable because MOND predicts a much smaller redshift-dependence.^[82]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * MOND researchers:\n\n    * Mordehai Milgrom \u2013 Israeli physicist (born 1946)\n    * Jacob Bekenstein \u2013 Mexican-Israeli physicist\n    * Stacy McGaugh \u2013 American astronomer (born 1964)\n    * Pavel Kroupa \u2013 Czech-Australian astrophysicist\n  * Alternatives to general relativity \u2013 Proposed theories of gravity\n\n    * Entropic gravity \u2013 Theory in modern physics that describes gravity as an entropic force\n  * AQUAL \u2013 Theory of gravity\n  * Cold dark matter \u2013 Hypothetical type of dark matter in physics\n  * Dark matter \u2013 Hypothetical form of matter that interacts with gravity, but not with light or electromagnetic field\n  * Lambda-CDM model \u2013 Model of Big Bang cosmology\n  * Galaxy rotation curve \u2013 Observed discrepancy in galactic angular momenta\n  * TeVeS \u2013 Relativistic generalization of Mordehai Milgrom's MOND paradigmPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n  * Tully\u2013Fisher relation \u2013 Trend in astronomy\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ It is also a problem for standard cold dark matter, since it needs to demonstrate that it is capable of forming galaxies without dark matter.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Hossenfelder, Sabine; McGaugh, Stacy S.
