Here\u2019s the science\n\nSome people take too much, and too many get too little. Experts explain who\nneeds D supplements, and why.\n\nBy Katarina Zimmer 04.18.2024\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Pocket\n  * Reddit\n  * Flipboard\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * Republish\n\nSupport sound science and smart stories Help us make scientific knowledge\naccessible to all Donate today\n\nNutritional science is supposed to chart a course to our healthier selves. But\ncontradictory scientific results and interpretations can muddy the waters \u2014\nand few nutrients have recently demonstrated that more clearly than vitamin D.\n\nAt one point, it seemed that everyone should be taking vitamin D supplements,\nand that doing so would protect against a whole host of maladies, from bone\nproblems to heart disease and cancer. More recently, new studies appear to\nhave debunked many of those claims.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nHealth & Disease\n\n### Matching meals to metabolism\n\nHealth & Disease\n\n### Fun facts about bones: More than just scaffolding\n\nHealth & Disease\n\n### Drink your beets\n\nBut a closer look at the research reveals a more nuanced message around\nvitamin D supplements: They can be key to correcting deficiencies, though\npeople who already have enough \u2014 which is most of the American public \u2014 are\ngenerally unlikely to see benefits from taking large doses. Experts have come\nto worry about supplement enthusiasts overdosing in the belief that more is\nbetter or, at the other extreme, some nutrient-deprived people shunning them\naltogether.\n\nUltimately, says Roger Bouillon, an endocrinologist at KU Leuven in Belgium,\n\u201cit\u2019s like for most things. You need an optimal amount: not too little, not\ntoo much.\u201d\n\nYet working out who needs vitamin D supplements, how much, and what the\nspecific health benefits are, remains tricky, with questions remaining. Here\u2019s\nsome of what we know.\n\n## What does vitamin D do, and where does it come from?\n\nThe importance of vitamin D came to light at the start of the Industrial\nRevolution in the late 1700s, when people in northern climes crowded in dark,\npolluted cities and spent more time working indoors. The majority of children\nin cities like Boston developed rickets, wherein bones soften, weaken and\noften deform.\n\nScientists eventually discovered that exposure to sunlight would cure and\nprevent the disease. Later, researchers learned that UV light from the Sun\nkick-starts a reaction that generates vitamin D. The vitamin gets converted\ninto its active form in the kidneys and then is shuttled to the intestine,\nwhere it stimulates cells to move calcium, a key building block of bones, into\nthe bloodstream. \u201cThe most important thing vitamin D does is intestinal\ncalcium absorption,\u201d says Sylvia Christakos, a biochemist at Rutgers New\nJersey Medical School.\n\nSevere vitamin D deficiency can cause the disease known as rickets, in which a\nlack of calcium leads to bone deformities. The disease was common among\nchildren in dark, northern cities before the discovery of vitamin D.\n\nCREDIT: WELLCOME COLLECTION\n\nThough the effects are most severe in children, vitamin D deficiencies can\nalso cause a softening of adult bones called osteomalacia, and increase the\nrisk of osteoporosis, where bones become weak, brittle and more prone to\nfractures. Though experts debate what exactly constitutes a vitamin D\ndeficiency \u2014 and know that healthy levels may vary from person to person \u2014\neveryone agrees that blood levels should not go below 12 nanograms per\nmilliliter to avoid severe deficiency.\n\nSuch severe deficiencies \u2014 and the bone ailments they cause \u2014 are still\nrampant across the world. Surprisingly, more than 30 percent of people in some\nsunny Middle Eastern countries are severely deficient, which may be partly\nattributed to skin-covering traditional clothing. By contrast, in Finland, a\nsun-deprived country with dark winters, severe deficiencies are relatively\nrare, thanks to government policies to fortify dairy products with extra\nvitamin D.\n\nIn contrast, around 20 percent of the United Kingdom\u2019s population is severely\ndeficient by some estimates, due to its northern, cloudy weather and a lack of\nfortified foods. The United States, where many dairy products, and some juices\nand breakfast cereals, are fortified, falls somewhere in the middle: Around 6\npercent of people are severely deficient. \u201cFor the most part in the US, we\ndon\u2019t see frank nutrient deficiencies,\u201d says Regan Bailey, a nutrition expert\nat Texas A&M University who recently coauthored a review on supplement use\namong the public in the Annual Review of Nutrition. (Some research groups have\nproduced much larger deficiency estimates by using blood level thresholds that\nmany experts say are too high to qualify as nutrient deficiencies.)\n\nSince 2010, the National Academy of Medicine has recommended relatively modest\ndaily doses: 400 international units (IUs) for babies, 600 IUs for everyone up\nto age 70 and 800 IUs for older people. These doses are designed to achieve\nlevels of 20 nanograms per milliliter \u2014 more than enough to avoid severe\ndeficiencies \u2014 for otherwise healthy people in the United States.\n\nMost people should be able to get these doses through brief sun exposure, says\nJohn Christopher Gallagher, an endocrinologist at Creighton University in\nOmaha, Nebraska. Measuring vitamin D production in the skin is not an exact\nscience, but five to 10 minutes\u2019 daily exposure without sunblock of just the\nface, neck, hands and arms should do the trick in the sunnier months, even in\ntemperate places like Boston. While it\u2019s entirely possible to get enough\nvitamin D this way, the official stance of the American Academy of Dermatology\nis to not get vitamin D from sun exposure.\n\nFortified dairy products and other foods will also provide enough. Foods that\nnaturally contain vitamin D, such as fatty fish, egg yolks, red meat, liver\nand irradiated or sun-dried mushrooms, which are especially rich in vitamin D\ndue to their increased exposure to UV light, can also help. \u201cIf you\u2019re out and\nabout and you have sun exposure during some months of the year,\u201d Gallagher\nsays, \u201cyou probably get plenty of vitamin D.\u201d That\u2019s especially true if you\nhave enough dairy in your diet.\n\nA few common food items can deliver a significant portion of your daily\nvitamin D needs, either because they are naturally rich in it or because they\nare fortified with the vitamin.\n\n## Does anyone need supplements?\n\nGenerally, people need supplements only when they\u2019re not likely to get enough\nfrom natural or dietary sources, health experts say. Deficiency-prone\npopulations include breastfed infants who don\u2019t get fortified formula, elderly\npeople (whose skin makes vitamin D less efficiently) and pregnant women.\nPeople with dark skin tones should also take care to get sufficient vitamin D,\nbecause melanin pigmentation in the skin blocks UV light. People in northern\nlatitudes like England \u201cshould all take a supplement during the winter,\u201d adds\nnutritional scientist Susan Lanham-New of the University of Surrey in the UK,\nalthough that\u2019s less important in places like the United States that have food\nfortification.\n\nExperts worry that it\u2019s often the people already getting enough vitamin D\nthrough diet and lifestyle who are the most likely to take supplements,\nChristakos notes. Meanwhile, communities who need vitamin D supplements the\nmost might not realize their need and may have read news reports suggesting\nthat the supplements aren\u2019t necessary.\n\nThat\u2019s an especially dangerous message in countries where deficiencies are\ncommon \u2014 for instance in the UK, where physicians still see children with\ndeficiency-related ailments, says Martin Hewison, a molecular endocrinologist\nat the University of Birmingham in that country. One of his UK colleagues is\nstruggling to persuade some of her vitamin D-deficient patients to take\nsupplements because they believe it is a waste of time.\n\nFor anyone concerned that they\u2019re not getting enough vitamin D, experts say\nthat up to 1,000 IUs a day would more than suffice. If possible, Lanham-New\nadds, make sure it\u2019s vitamin D3, a version typically extracted from sheep wool\nthat appears to be better at raising vitamin D blood levels than D2, which is\noften vegan and mushroom-based.\n\nBut avoid the high doses \u2014 of 5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 IUs, or even higher \u2014\nthat can be found in drugstores or online, stresses JoAnn Manson, an\nendocrinologist and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard\nMedical School. Too much vitamin D, even when taken occasionally, can\nsometimes cause bone health to deteriorate and lead to an overdose of calcium\nin the blood and urine, resulting in nausea and even kidney failure. There are\nreports of people in the UK and US ending up in the hospital after taking\nexcessive doses.\n\nCertain groups of people are at greater risk of not getting enough vitamin D.\nHere are some of them.\n\nSome experts have advised that Black Americans, in particular, take higher\ndoses of supplements \u2014 for instance, 2,500 IUs \u2014 as they\u2019re especially prone\nto low levels. But here\u2019s a mystery: Even though 17.5 percent of African\nAmericans have deficient levels of vitamin D, those vitamin-deficient Blacks\ntend to have better bone health than comparably deficient Caucasians, notes\nbiomedical scientist LaVerne Brown of the National Institutes of Health. It\u2019s\npossible, she says, that African Americans need less vitamin D than other\npopulations, perhaps because they\u2019re better at metabolizing vitamin D to its\nfinal active form. If that\u2019s true, then high doses may have a greater risk of\ncausing harm in African Americans.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the studies that are focusing on these populations in\norder to come up with definitive answers,\u201d Brown says. In the meantime, an\nexpert panel meeting in 2017 concluded that the current recommended intake\nshould be enough for African Americans, the same as everyone else. \u201cAnything\nabove 800 IU, it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s a real need for that,\u201d Brown says.\n\n## Could higher doses have benefits?\n\nMore than two decades ago, scientists began to make observations suggesting\nthat vitamin D at higher doses could have benefits beyond bone health. Dozens\nof studies described strong correlations between people\u2019s vitamin D levels and\na range of diseases like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain\ncancers. The lower someone\u2019s vitamin D levels were, the likelier they were to\nhave these diseases, while higher levels were associated with being healthier.\n\nOther research showed that many cell types \u2014 in the lungs, heart and immune\nsystem \u2014 have receptors for the vitamin to dock onto, hinting at far-reaching\neffects across the body. Giving vitamin D to lab mice with conditions\nmimicking human diseases could often improve their ailments. Vitamin D, it\nseemed, might help to tackle the major diseases of our time.\n\nFrom New Zealand to Europe to North America, scientists launched large\nclinical trials, enrolling thousands of people over multiple years, to test\nwhether vitamin D supplements would decrease their risk of disease.\nImportantly, the studies focused on members of the general public, who were\nlargely healthy and had adequate levels of vitamin D. These people then\nreceived relatively large doses, of 2,000 or 4,000 IUs or even higher. The\nstudies asked whether there were benefits from getting more than the\nrecommended dietary allowance and ending up with blood levels even higher than\n20 or 30 nanograms per milliliter, Manson explains.\n\nTo the disappointment of many scientists, giving these generous doses to\nhealthy people didn\u2019t change their risk of developing cancer, heart disease or\nasthma, nor did it significantly prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes.\nExtra vitamin D beyond the recommended levels didn\u2019t even do anything to\nimprove bone health or reduce the risk of fractures.\n\nExperts recommend relatively modest daily doses of vitamin D supplements.\n\nThere may be a simple biological reason why more vitamin D isn\u2019t necessarily\nbetter: The version of vitamin D found in supplements needs to be converted in\nthe liver and kidneys to reach its final, active form \u2014 and that process is\nprobably tightly controlled, says Bouillon. \u201cThe body regulates that so you\nhave the exact amount, and not more than what you need.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway, many experts agree, is that most healthy people aren\u2019t going to\nbenefit from high doses of vitamin D if they already have enough. The\ntantalizing associations that led researchers to suspect additional powers of\nvitamin D could have been an illusion: People with illnesses may end up with\nlower vitamin D levels because of the diseases themselves, or the unhealthy\nlifestyles that caused them, says Bouillon.\n\n## Are larger doses ever helpful?\n\nA few of the recent trials hinted that some groups of people may benefit from\nhigher doses, but these possible benefits need to be confirmed in further\nstudies, says Manson, who ran one of the trials, called VITAL, which studied\nnearly 26,000 US adults over five years and looked at supplements of 2,000 IUs\nof vitamin D as well as omega-3 fatty acids. In that study, participants\ndidn\u2019t have a lower risk of developing cancer but they did have a 25 percent\nlower chance of it metastasizing or becoming fatal. Perhaps, says Manson,\nvitamin D makes tumors less likely to metastasize and kill. VITAL also\nreported that high doses of vitamin D made people less likely to develop\ncertain autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and lupus.\n\nManson notes that these benefits appeared to be most visible among people with\na healthy weight, compared to overweight or obese participants. But she\ncautions that more research is needed to understand these observations and\nconfirm the observed benefits of larger doses.\n\nPhysicians in clinical practice, of course, have leeway in prescribing higher\ndoses to certain people as they see fit, such as for osteoporosis patients, or\npeople with conditions that hamper the absorption of vitamin D through the\ndiet, like Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\n## What don\u2019t we know yet?\n\nAs they probe potential effects of higher doses in non-deficient people,\nresearchers still don\u2019t know how many roles vitamin D might have. The trouble\nis that recent trials don\u2019t tell us whether having enough vitamin D is\nimportant for maintaining healthy heart function or avoiding cancer, for\ninstance \u2014 only that having more than that won\u2019t help in most cases.\n\nTo prove that adequate vitamin D has health benefits beyond keeping bones\nstrong, scientists need more research in which some deficient people receive\nsupplements and the rest receive a placebo. But such studies are hard to\nconduct in places like the US, where severe deficiencies are relatively rare.\nIt\u2019s also not ethically justifiable to seek out people who are deficient and\nthen deprive half of them of much-needed supplements, because of the risk of\npoor bone health in vitamin D-deficient people.\n\nSome scientists believe that having enough vitamin D could be key to\nmaintaining heart and immune system health and preventing diabetes and cancer\n\u2014 and perhaps even be important for brain function, athletic performance and\nother claims. The evidence is particularly strong in the immune system, says\nHewison, whose research points to key roles of vitamin D in immune cells; and\nindeed, human trials that by chance included some deficient people show\nbenefits of supplementation in warding off infections.\n\nBut there just aren\u2019t enough data yet, Hewison says. \u201cI think this is the\nissue facing the field as a whole.\u201d\n\n10.1146/knowable-041824-1\n\nKatarina Zimmer is a science and environment journalist and a contributing\nwriter to Knowable Magazine.
