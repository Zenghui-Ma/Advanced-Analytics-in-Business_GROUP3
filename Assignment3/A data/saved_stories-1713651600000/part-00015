In\nthe guise of \u2018Y.C\u2019 (Your Corespondent), Hemingway addresses a young man who\nhad in real life hitch-hiked from upper Minnesota to the writer\u2019s home in Key\nWest, Florida, to ask him a few questions about writing.\n\nHemingway explained why he was doing it:\n\n> If they can deter anyone from writing he should be deterred. If they can be\n> of use to anyone your correspondent is pleased. If they bore you there are\n> plenty of pictures in the magazine that you may turn to. Your\n> correspondent\u02bcs excuse for presenting them is that some of the information\n> contained would have been worth fifty cents to him when he was twenty-one.\n\nWriting as both himself and as Mice, Hemingway was living his own advice to\n\u201cget in somebody else\u2019s head for a change\u201d. And not to take it too personally\n\u2013 \u201cIf I bawl you out try to figure what I\u2019m thinking about as well as how you\nfeel about it.\u201d\n\nAnd you get there by listening. \u201cWhen people talk listen completely,\u201d\nHemingway advises. \u201cDon\u02bct be thinking what you\u02bcre going to say. Most people\nnever listen. Nor do they observe.\u201d And read a lot \u2013 this column also included\nhis 16 books every writer should read.\n\n> Mice: What do you mean by good writing as opposed to bad writing?\n>\n> Your correspondent: Good writing is true writing. If a man is making a story\n> up it will be true in proportion to the amount of knowledge of life that he\n> has and how conscientious he is; so that when he makes something up it is as\n> it would truly be. If he doesn\u02bct know how many people work in their minds\n> and actions his luck may save him for a while, or he may write fantasy. But\n> if he continues to write about what he does not know about he will find\n> himself faking. After he fakes a few times he cannot write honestly any\n> more.\n>\n> Mice: Then what about imagination?\n>\n> Y.C.: Nobody knows a damned thing about it except that it is what we get for\n> nothing. It may be a racial experience*. I think that is quite possible. It\n> is the one thing beside honesty that a good writer must have. The more he\n> learns from experience the more truly he can imagine. If he gets so he can\n> imagine truly enough people will think that the things he relates all really\n> happened and that he is just reporting.\n\nThe conversation continues, with Mice asking how writing differs from\nreporting (answer: with writing you get the complete story that stands the the\nof time and place) \u2013 a reply he does not fully understand. He wants to how you\nget the first word down.\n\n> Mice (undeterred): Tell me some more about the mechanics of writing.\n>\n> Y.C.: What do you mean? Like pencil or typewriter? For chrissake.\n>\n> Mice: Yes.\n>\n> Y.C.: Listen. When you start to write you get all the kick and the reader\n> gets none. So you might as well use a typewriter because it is that much\n> easier and you enjoy it that much more. After you learn to write your whole\n> object is to convey everything, every sensation, sight, feeling, place and\n> emotion to the reader. To do this you have to work over what you write. If\n> you write with a pencil you get three different sights at it to see if the\n> reader is getting what you wanted him to. First when you read it over; then\n> when it is typed you get another chance to improve it, and again in the\n> proof. Writing it first in pencil gives you one-third more chance to improve\n> it. That is .333 which is a damned good average for a hitter. It also keeps\n> it fluid longer so that you can better it easier.\n\nAnd then to give yourself the best chance of actually finishing the book: \u201cThe\nbest way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will\nhappen next... and never be stuck\u201d; and \u201cread it all every day from the start,\ncorrecting as you go along, then go on from where you stopped the day before.\u201d\n\nMore advice from Hemingway in how to write a six-word short story; how to camp\nwell; how to eat raw lion; what to read in isolation; how to get cats to love\nyou; and the importance of keeping a notebook.\n\nVia: Diane Drake\n\n  * 6\n\nShares\n\n  * 11\n\nShare\n\n  * Post\n\n  * Pin\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Mail\n\n  * Share\n\n## Would you like to support Flashbak?\n\nPlease consider making a donation to our site.
