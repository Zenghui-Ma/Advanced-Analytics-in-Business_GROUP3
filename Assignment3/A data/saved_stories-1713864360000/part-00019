As good as Tesla\u2019s supercharging network is, it\u2019s nowhere\nnear the infrastructure buildout of gasoline vehicles, it can still be\ninconvenient on 300+ mile trips; although to be fair, ICE infrastructure has\nhad a century head start. These folks want to leave a better world to their\nkids; they are realists about the dangers presented by climate change, and\nthey think individuals can make a difference via their personal choices. Oh,\nand they believe in science.\n\nIt is not that this group is exclusively Democrats, but draw a Venn diagram\nwith the folks I described above and Dems, and the overlap is significant.\n\nNow comes the Wall St. Journal with the headline: Elon Musk Lost Democrats on\nTesla When He Needed Them Most\n\n> The proportion of Democrats buying Tesla vehicles fell by more than 60%,\n> according to car buyers surveyed in October and November by researcher\n> Strategic Vision.\n\nI\u2019m not one who\u2019s typically inclined to take a victory lap, but this one feels\nlike it was so obvious to see coming by bringing together data from very\ndisparate sources and nailed the eventual outcome.\n\nIf your politics puts you on the opposite side of the NYT/Paul Krugman, how do\nyou reconcile that now Murdoch\u2019s WSJ has come to accept this relaity as\nwell...?\n\nBR adds: What makes this so perplexing is what an unforced error this has\nbeen. Musk moved the entire auto industry towards electric, he had amassed\nenormous goodwill and had a built-in customer base that was very loyal. All he\nhad to do was not screw it up, which \u2014 apparently \u2014 was a bridge too far.\n\nAt its peak, TSLA was worth $1.29 trillion; today, it is $448.9 billion:\n\nThat is a 65% decrease in market cap + price:\n\nOf course, there is much more competition today, and Tesla\u2019s designs are\ngetting old, and looking a little stale. Their huge decade-long software\nadvantage is now probably somewhere in the 2 -4 year range.\n\nAt least it will make for a fascinating HBS case study in the future...\n\nSource: Elon Musk Lost Democrats on Tesla When He Needed Them Most Tim Higgins\nWSJ, April 20, 2024\n\nHow to Destroy a Brand, Musk Style Paul Krugman NYT, Dec. 30, 2022\n\nThis content, which contains security-related opinions and/or information, is\nprovided for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon in any\nmanner as professional advice, or an endorsement of any practices, products or\nservices.
