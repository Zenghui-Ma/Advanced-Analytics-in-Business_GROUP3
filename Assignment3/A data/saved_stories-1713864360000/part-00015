I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 I thought I was mishearing them.\n\n\u201cI asked them to repeat it three or four times because I didn\u2019t believe I was\nsitting there for saying that veganism is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt hurts me that in this country freedom of speech can now mean so little.\nIt\u2019s shocking that a Russell Group university can act this way\u201d\u2018\n\n## \u2018Eavesdroppers rewarded\u2019\n\nHe said he apologised to the officials for the disturbance but maintained his\nright to speak freely in his own room. \u201cI was totally private apart from that\nsomeone heard me through a brick wall.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Exeter has been approached for comment.\n\nEdward Skidelsky, director of the Committee for Academic Freedom, said: \u201cIt\u2019s\nextraordinary that in 21st-century Britain eavesdroppers can be rewarded, and\na student punished for remarks made to a friend in the privacy of his room.\u201d\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * University of Exeter,\n  * Exeter,\n  * Students,\n  * Freedom of speech\n\n2074\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
