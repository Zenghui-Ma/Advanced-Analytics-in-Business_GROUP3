It includes upgrades to Chromium\n124.0.6367.49, V8 12.4, and Node.js 20.11.1.\n\nThe Electron team is excited to announce the release of Electron 30.0.0! You\ncan install it with npm via npm install electron@latest or download it from\nour releases website. Continue reading for details about this release.\n\nIf you have any feedback, please share it with us on Twitter or Mastodon, or\njoin our community Discord! Bugs and feature requests can be reported in\nElectron's issue tracker.\n\n## Notable Changes\n\n### Highlights\n\n  * ASAR Integrity fuse now supported on Windows (#40504)\n\n    * Existing apps with ASAR Integrity enabled may not work on Windows if not configured correctly. Apps using Electron packaging tools should upgrade to @electron/packager@18.3.1 or @electron/forge@7.4.0.\n    * Take a look at our ASAR Integrity tutorial for more information.\n  * Added WebContentsView and BaseWindow main process modules, deprecating & replacing BrowserView (#35658)\n\n    * BrowserView is now a shim over WebContentsView and the old implementation has been removed.\n    * See our Web Embeds documentation for a comparison of the new WebContentsView API to other similar APIs.\n  * Implemented support for the File System API (#41827)\n\n### Stack Changes\n\n  * Chromium 124.0.6367.49\n\n    * New in Chrome 124 and in DevTools 124\n    * New in Chrome 123 and in DevTools 123\n  * Node 20.11.1\n\n    * Node 20.11.1 notes\n  * V8 12.4\n\nElectron 30 upgrades Chromium from 122.0.6261.39 to 124.0.6367.49, Node from\n20.9.0 to 20.11.1, and V8 from 12.2 to 12.4.\n\n### New Features\n\n  * Added a transparent webpreference to webviews. (#40301)\n  * Added a new instance property navigationHistory on webContents API with navigationHistory.getEntryAtIndex method, enabling applications to retrieve the URL and title of any navigation entry within the browsing history. (#41662)\n  * Added new BrowserWindow.isOccluded() method to allow apps to check occlusion status. (#38982)\n  * Added proxy configuring support for requests made with the net module from the utility process. (#41417)\n  * Added support for Bluetooth ports being requested by service class ID in navigator.serial. (#41734)\n  * Added support for the Node.js NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS CLI flag. (#41822)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n#### Behavior Changed: cross-origin iframes now use Permission Policy to\naccess features\n\nCross-origin iframes must now specify features available to a given iframe via\nthe allow attribute in order to access them.\n\nSee documentation for more information.\n\n#### Removed: The --disable-color-correct-rendering command line switch\n\nThis switch was never formally documented but its removal is being noted here\nregardless. Chromium itself now has better support for color spaces so this\nflag should not be needed.\n\n#### Behavior Changed: BrowserView.setAutoResize behavior on macOS\n\nIn Electron 30, BrowserView is now a wrapper around the new WebContentsView\nAPI.\n\nPreviously, the setAutoResize function of the BrowserView API was backed by\nautoresizing on macOS, and by a custom algorithm on Windows and Linux. For\nsimple use cases such as making a BrowserView fill the entire window, the\nbehavior of these two approaches was identical. However, in more advanced\ncases, BrowserViews would be autoresized differently on macOS than they would\nbe on other platforms, as the custom resizing algorithm for Windows and Linux\ndid not perfectly match the behavior of macOS's autoresizing API. The\nautoresizing behavior is now standardized across all platforms.\n\nIf your app uses BrowserView.setAutoResize to do anything more complex than\nmaking a BrowserView fill the entire window, it's likely you already had\ncustom logic in place to handle this difference in behavior on macOS. If so,\nthat logic will no longer be needed in Electron 30 as autoresizing behavior is\nconsistent.\n\n#### Removed: params.inputFormType property on context-menu on WebContents\n\nThe inputFormType property of the params object in the context-menu event from\nWebContents has been removed. Use the new formControlType property instead.\n\n#### Removed: process.getIOCounters()\n\nChromium has removed access to this information.\n\n## End of Support for 27.x.y\n\nElectron 27.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's support\npolicy. Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer\nversion of Electron.\n\nE30 (Apr'24)| E31 (Jun'24)| E32 (Aug'24)  \n---|---|---  \n30.x.y| 31.x.y| 32.x.y  \n29.x.y| 30.x.y| 31.x.y  \n28.x.y| 29.x.y| 30.x.y  \n  \n## What's Next\n\nIn the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up\nwith the development of the major components that make up Electron, including\nChromium, Node, and V8.\n\nYou can find Electron's public timeline here.\n\nMore information about future changes can be found on the Planned Breaking\nChanges page.\n\n  * Notable Changes\n\n    * Highlights\n    * Stack Changes\n    * New Features\n    * Breaking Changes\n\n      * Behavior Changed: cross-origin iframes now use Permission Policy to access features\n      * Removed: The --disable-color-correct-rendering command line switch\n      * Behavior Changed: BrowserView.setAutoResize behavior on macOS\n      * Removed: params.inputFormType property on context-menu on WebContents\n      * Removed: process.getIOCounters()\n  * End of Support for 27.x.y\n  * What's Next\n\nDocs\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * API Reference\n\nChecklists\n\n  * Performance\n  * Security\n\nTools\n\n  * Electron Forge\n  * Electron Fiddle\n\nCommunity\n\n  * Governance\n  * Resources\n  * Discord\n  * Twitter\n  * Mastodon\n  * Stack Overflow\n\nMore\n\n  * GitHub\n  * Open Collective\n  * Infrastructure Dashboard\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 OpenJS Foundation and Electron contributors.\n\nHosting and infrastructure graciously provided by\n\n", "frontpage": true}
