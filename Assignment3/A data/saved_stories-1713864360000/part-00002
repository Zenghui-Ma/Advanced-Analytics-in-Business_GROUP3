You will be testing your font to see\nif the combination of decisions you have made:\n\n  * Allows you to read the font\n  * Makes the font feel right to you\n  * Makes the font useful for the the jobs you want the font to be able to do.\n\nAs you test the design, you will have to trust your perceptions and design\nsomewhat practically. Much of type design requires that you make letters\nsimilar and that you repeat forms.\n\nIt is tempting to assume that if you measure the parts and the spaces between\nthe glyphs, then you will get reliable results. While very useful, this\napproach has real limitations. You should expect to make adjustments if\nsomething looks wrong to you. Furthermore, you should feel confident that\nmaking changes until it \u201clooks right\u201d is the correct thing to do.\n\nThe reason this is true is that there are a number of natural optical\nillusions that all readers are subject to. These illusions must be accounted\nfor by altering the shapes of letters until they look right to you.\n\nYou can get a feel of where to look and what elements to adjust in these Type\nReview Videos.\n\n## Examples of illusions\n\nSome illusions involve the perceived weight of lines, some involve the\nperceived length of lines, and others involve the eye\u2019s perception of shapes.\n\n### Horizontal vs. vertical weight\n\nThe example on the left shows an \u2018H\u2019 with bars which are precisely equal in\nthickness. This looks wrong. Can you feel it?\n\nThe other one on the right has a horizontal bar which has been thinned to\nappear equal in thickness.\n\nGlyphs in which optical adjustments have to be made are numerous and include\nA, E, F, L, H, f, t, and z.\n\n### Diagonal thickness\n\nSimilarly, if you have bars of the same width and one of them is set at a\ndiagonal, the diagonal bar will seem slightly heavier than the vertical bar\nand slightly thinner than the horizontal. If you want it look right, you will\nhave to adjust it to be lighter like the horizontal example, but just a little\nless.\n\nGlyphs in which this human perception may be relevant are quite numerous but\ninclude k, K, N, Q, R, v, V, w, W, x, X, y, Y, 7, 2, &, \u0142, \u0141, \u00f8, \u00d8, \u221a, \u2215, \u2039,\n\u203a, \u00ab, \u00bb, 1\u20442, 1\u20443, 1\u20444, \u2264, \u2265, and \u00d7.\n\n### Length and perceived diagonal angle\n\nLonger shapes need to slant less than short shapes in order to give the\nappearance of same slant.\n\nThe image below has diagonal lines that are all at the same angle. The long\none appears to be at a different angle.\n\nIn the next picture below, the slant of the longer line has been adjusted:\n\nNow let\u2019s look at an actual italic, applying these corrections to the glyphs:\n\n### Crossing diagonals\n\nWhen a bar crosses another diagonal or a straight line, it will need\nadjustments to not appear as misaligned.\n\nIn the example above, the X on the left has two unadjusted bars crossing each\nother. The example on the right has been adjusted so that they appear to be\naligned.\n\nAs you can see in this X with dotted line on top of it, the X that appears\nvisually aligned involves an offset.\n\nGlyphs in which this illusion is relevant include x, X, k, K, \u00d7, #, and the\nIcelandic letter \u2018eth\u2019 (\u00f0).\n\n### Perceived height\n\nThe shape of a glyph will contribute to how high it needs to be in order to\nlook as if it is the same height as the other glyphs. Round glyphs need to\novershoot the height of flat glyphs by a little bit. Glyphs which have\npointier shapes will need to overshoot more. The sharper the shape, the more\nit will need to overshoot in order to look correct.\n\nIn the image above, the top three shapes are unadjusted \u2014 that is, they have\nidentical heights. The three shapes on the bottom have been adjusted so that\nthey appear more similar in height.\n\nThis illusion is relevant for any glyph that has parts which are either round\nor pointy. These include O, Q, C, S, A, V, W, and so on.\n\n## You are fully qualified to correct for these illusions\n\nBecause you can see both the illusion and the effect of correcting for the\nillusion, you will be able to make these corrections for yourself. You just\nhave to trust your impressions.\n\n## Test for fitness of purpose\n\nJust like you are able to see optical illusions and correct them, you also\nhave the ability to tell if a font is working for the specific use (or uses)\nyou may have in mind. That\u2019s where you should also trust your judgment.\n\nQuite separately, it is worth noting that no font can be evaluated apart from\nthe way it is used and what it is used for. This is why it is essential to\nbegin testing from the very beginning of the design process, and to continue\ntesting until you feel the project is done.\n\nWhat will these tests be like? The tests will be simple at first, allowing you\nto test the first design choices. As your design becomes more complete, your\ntests will need to keep pace and let you evaluate the relative success or\nfailure of the newest choices you have made \u2014 or, even better, to compare two\n(or three, or more...) options you are considering.\n\nSometimes you will find you have to double back and change a design choice you\nthought was already working well. This is normal. Making a font requires\nbalancing many variables, and surprises often occur. The more you design\nfonts, the more experience you will have in making these arbitrary choices.\n\nWhen nearing the end of the process, if the font is to be used in a simple\nway, the tests should also just stay simple. However, if a font is to be used\nin many ways or in a wide range of printing or screen environments, then it\nshould be tested across all that range of situations, which includes printing\nvarious samples of the font.\n\nIt can save you design time to have a well defined idea of the final use you\nintend. However, this is not always possible and your ideas may evolve. The\nkey thing is to think about and define the use cases as completely as you can,\nthen to ensure that your tests keep pace with the questions you are asking\nyourself while designing the font.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n  * http://typographica.org/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/\n  * http://typedrawers.com/discussion/1085/the-letter-s\n\n  1.
