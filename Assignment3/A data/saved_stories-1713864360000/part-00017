Technically this is true, but a second question\nreveals the flaw: \"Why must they be followed?\" \"Rules are made to be\nfollowed.\"\n\nThis allowed writers to come up with the phrase: \"Rules are made to be\nbroken.\"\n\nThe most apparent reason for following rules is avoiding punishment that must\nbe enforced onto violators. So people start hiding that they broke the rules\nto avoid punishment. This is known to lead to disasters.\n\n> \"Rules are written in blood.\"\n\nRules are safeguards that prevent certain events from happening, but the legal\nsystem manages to obscure this fact to an incredible degree. There are members\nof society who like finding flaws in phrasing and cite them for things the\nrules were never meant or designed for.\n\nUnfortunately interpreting rules doesn't change the reasons behind them, when\nrules fail, one should fallback onto the reasons, not the wording.\n\nPeople are brainwashed from a young age that rules and laws must be followed,\nwhich is good because you can allow stupid people to do stuff without breaking\nanything. Explaining all the reasons to everybody would be far to complicated\nso Rules are an effective proxy: you don't need to know why, you just follow\nthem and bad things don't happen.\n\nBut no Rules wrap perfectly around reasons, they stick out and leave gaps, and\nit is a flaw of modern society that the excess is taken seriously and the gaps\nare ignored.\n\nThe World's Greatest Criminal\n\nSome say Albert Einstein broke Newton's Laws, but he just fixed them as flaws\nrevealed themselves.\n\nSome Rules are wrong, their meaning is twisted beyond reason, so be the\ncriminal break the rules and follow the reasons. But remember, rules are there\nfor fools like you and me, so just in case: Failsafe\n\n> Don't wear a helmet because it's the law.
