WIRED took it for a spin.\n\nPhoto-illustration: Jacqui VanLiew; Getty Images\n\nIt seems as though we\u2019ve arrived at the moment in the AI hype cycle where no\nidea is too bonkers to launch. This week\u2019s eyebrow-raising AI project is a new\ntwist on the romantic chatbot\u2014a mobile app called AngryGF, which offers its\nusers the uniquely unpleasant experience of getting yelled at via messages\nfrom a fake person. Or, as cofounder Emilia Aviles explained in her original\npitch: \u201cIt simulates scenarios where female partners are angry, prompting\nusers to comfort their angry AI partners\u201d through a \u201cgamified approach.\u201d The\nidea is to teach communication skills by simulating arguments that the user\ncan either win or lose depending on whether they can appease their fuming\ngirlfriend.\n\nSign Up Today\n\nThis is an edition of WIRED's Fast Forward newsletter, a weekly dispatch from\nthe future by Will Knight, exploring AI advances and other technology set to\nchange our lives. This week, WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs is filling in.\n\nThe central appeal of a relationship-simulating chatbot, I\u2019ve always assumed,\nis that they\u2019re easier to interact with than real-life humans. They have no\nneeds or desires of their own. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll reject you or mock\nyou. They exist as a sort of emotional security blanket. So the premise of\nAngryGF amused me. You get some of the downsides of a real-life\ngirlfriend\u2014she\u2019s furious!!\u2014but none of the upsides. Who would voluntarily use\nthis?\n\nObviously, I downloaded AngryGF immediately. (It\u2019s available, for those who\ndare, on both the Apple App Store and Google Play.) The app offers a variety\nof situations where a girlfriend might ostensibly be mad and need \u201ccomfort.\u201d\nThey include \u201cYou put your savings into the stock market and lose 50 percent\nof it. Your girlfriend finds out and gets angry\u201d and \u201cDuring a conversation\nwith your girlfriend, you unconsciously praise a female friend by mentioning\nthat she is beautiful and talented. Your girlfriend becomes jealous and\nangry.\u201d\n\nThe app sets an initial \u201cforgiveness level\u201d anywhere between 0 and 100\npercent. You have 10 tries to say soothing things that tilt the forgiveness\nmeter back to 100. I chose the beguilingly vague scenario called \u201cAngry for no\nreason,\u201d in which the girlfriend is, uh, angry for no reason. The forgiveness\nmeter was initially set to a measly 30 percent, indicating I had a hard road\nahead of me.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nReader: I failed. Although I genuinely tried to write messages that would\nappease my hopping-mad fake girlfriend, she continued to interpret my words in\nthe least generous light and accuse me of not paying attention to her. A\nsimple \u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d text from me\u2014Caring! Considerate! Asking\nquestions!\u2014was met with an immediately snappy answer: \u201cOh, now you care about\nhow I\u2019m doing?\u201d Attempts to apologize only seemed to antagonize her further.\nWhen I proposed a dinner date, she told me that wasn\u2019t sufficient but also\nthat I better take her \u201csomewhere nice.\u201d\n\nDATING APPS ONLINE LTD via Kate Knibbs\n\nIt was such an irritating experience that I snapped and told this bitchy bot\nthat she was annoying. \u201cGreat to know that my feelings are such a bother to\nyou,\u201d the sarcast-o-bot replied. When I decided to try again a few hours\nlater, the app informed me that I\u2019d need to upgrade to the paid version to\nunlock more scenarios for $6.99 a week. No thank you.\n\nAt this point I wondered if the app was some sort of avant-garde performance\nart. Who would even want their partner to sign up? I would not be thrilled if\nI knew my husband considered me volatile enough to require practicing lady-\nplacation skills on a synthetic shrew. While ostensibly preferable to AI\ngirlfriend apps seeking to supplant IRL relationships, an app designed to\ncoach men to get better at talking to women by creating a robot woman who is a\ntotal killjoy might actually be even worse.\n\nI called Aviles, the cofounder, to try to understand what, exactly, was\nhappening with AngryGF. She\u2019s a Chicago-based social media marketer who says\nthat the app was inspired by her own past relationships, where she was\nunimpressed by her partners\u2019 communication skills. Her schtick seemed sincere.\n\u201cYou know men,\u201d she says. \u201cThey listen, but then they don\u2019t take action.\u201d\n\nAviles describes herself as the app\u2019s cofounder but isn\u2019t particularly well-\nversed in the nuts and bolts of its creation. (She says a team of \u201cbetween 10\nand 20\u201d people work on the app but that she is the only founder willing to put\nher name on the product.) She was able to specify that the app is built on top\nof OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and wasn\u2019t made with any additional custom training data\nlike actual text messages between significant others.\n\n\u201cWe didn't really directly consult with a relationship therapist or anything\nlike that,\u201d she says.
