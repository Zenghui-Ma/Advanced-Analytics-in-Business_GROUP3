If I had to\nguess, when Apple was ready to launch the Vision Pro back in February and word\ngot out that YouTube and Netflix were absent, some VP sent another VP a\nmessage and it finally got back to the VP of PR and they said:\n\n> Now is our f*&^#&@ chance to crush Apple, how fast can you get commitments\n> from some big names like Netflix, YouTube, Sony, Valve saying that they are\n> development partners for our new OS?\n\nPR person: \"Give me a few days.\"\n\nPR person, a few days later:\n\n> Alright, I got ASUS, Lenovo and Xbox... is that good enough?\n\nVP (thinking)\n\n> Those will do.\n\nThen, it's all a mad scramble to actually sign some deals and get money\nchanging hands ie: my guess is that Meta is paying Asus, Lenovo and Microsoft\nto build / prototype or at very least say they are building for this new\nplatform.\n\nAll of this, I wager, to say F-You to Apple.\n\nThis is the key section in the article\n\nAlong with a more open app store, Meta Horizon OS will continue to give people\nmore choice in how to access apps. Because we don\u2019t restrict users to titles\nfrom our own app store, there are multiple ways to access great content on\nMeta Horizon OS, including popular gaming services like Xbox Game Pass\nUltimate, or through Steam Link or our Air Link system for wirelessly\nstreaming PC software to headsets.\n\nApple is being dragged through the mud for exactly the opposite stance that\nMeta is taking here. This is spatial war, and Meta is likely going to win if\nApple doesn't correct it's course.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love this announcement. I use my Quest 2 several times a\nweek and am a big beleiver that the future of work and meetings is in VR. I am\nreally just applauding how very little was actually said in this announcement\nand in order to put this together it's actually quite simple from a PR / DB\nside. What's more, now every developer, including myself who read this today\nis questioning downloading that 10.5GB version of XCode that doesn't have AI\nbuilt into it, that will require Apple's approval or... I could buy the Quest\n3 and know that Meta is moving to a more open future.\n\nHonestly, kudos to Mark Zuckerberg. These are high IQ moves and it could\nreally hurt Apple if Meta wins the hearts and minds of developers.\n\n## What Apple needs to do... tomorrow\n\nHopefully someone at Apple has thought of this, but if not, here goes.\n\nThey need to drive to Netflix HQ, get down on their knees and beg them to\nbuild the best movie experience on the Vision Pro.\n\nThey then need to drive to YouTube HQ, get down on their knees and beg them to\nbuild the best video experience on the Vision Pro.\n\nThey then need to drive to Steven Spielberg's office and beg him to make a\nmovie using the Vision Pro's unique camera system.\n\nThey then need to drive to Capcom / Hideo Kojima's house and beg for them to\nmake exclusive AAA games, not game for the Vision Pro.\n\nBasically, Apple needs to remember that without the other people making\namazing shit for their devices, their devices aren't as cool, and no matter\nhow rich Apple is, they can't beat the free market and creativity that\nindividuals can come up with in a decentralized way.\n\nApple needs to remember that devs are what drives their business, and\npartnerships like the one with Google in the early days of the iPhone made the\nproduct what it is today.\n\nApple needs to make more deals and less software.\n\n## Read more\n\n### The AI Race Has Begun\n\nToday marks the beginning of the AI race.
