In addition, AI technology can mimic human biases, as a\nparticular AI image generator has been reported by Mia Sato on The Verge to\nhave problems generating images of couples with Asian Males White Females.\nThat particular type of couple (aka AMWF) doesn\u2019t seem to happen as often as\nthe reverse, as has been discussed on our site many times. Technology evolves\nquickly, so I decided to it out for myself as well as try out another AI Image\nGenerator. Note that all of the pictures in this post were generated on April\n15, 2024.\n\nThe AI image generator in question comes from Meta and can be found at\nimagine.meta.com. The above picture is what I got when I tried \u201casian man with\nwhite wife\u201d as a prompt. Apparently \u201casian woman with white male\u201d can be\nconceived but the reverse cannot not. The image generator gave a number of\nchoices, and all of them wrong in the same way. It made me wonder how other\nprompts would do as well as another AI image generator.\n\nI decided to explore how using specific Asian ethnicities in the prompt would\nhave an effect. It was a little bit better. \u201cChinese man with white wife\u201d had\n25% of its suggestions correct, and the first suggestion was correct, and the\nother pictures were of a Chinese husband and Chinese wife.\n\nHow about \u201cFilipino man and white wife?\u201d This one was a little worse than the\nprevious. The first suggestion is incorrect, but one of the four suggestions\nis correct. You might think that the third suggestion is correct, but closer\nexamination shows an Asian woman with her hair dyed blond with her dark roots\nshowing. Interesting.\n\nI decided to try Thai Man and white wife. Complete failure on this one.\n\nHow do other image generators do? Microsoft Designer, powered by OpenAI\u2019s\nDall-E, was better, although it had an incorrect second choice as you can see\nbelow.\n\nAs noted above, I took these samples on April 15, about week after Sato\u2019s\noriginal article came out. I think it would be interesting to revisit these\nimage generators in a few months and seeing if and how they have been\nadjusted. In any case, this is a good example that shows how results from some\nof the latest AI tools need to be considered carefully.\n\nThanks for rating this!
