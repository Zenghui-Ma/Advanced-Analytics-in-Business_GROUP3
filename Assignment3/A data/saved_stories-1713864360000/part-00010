But it's also bespoke Raspberry Pi\nhardware, in Yellow and Green. It's entirely free, but it also receives\nfunding through a private cloud services company, Nabu Casa. It contains tiny\nboard project ESPHome and other inter-connected bits. It has wide-ranging\nvoice assistant ambitions, but it doesn't want to be Alexa or Google\nAssistant. Home Assistant is a lot.\n\nAfter an announcement this weekend, however, Home Assistant's shape is a bit\neasier to draw out. All of the project's ambitions now fall under the Open\nHome Foundation, a non-profit organization that now contains Home Assistant\nand more than 240 related bits. Its mission statement is refreshing, and\nrefreshingly honest about the state of modern open source projects.\n\nThe three pillars of the Open Home Foundation.\n\nOpen Home Foundation\n\n\"We've done this to create a bulwark against surveillance capitalism, the risk\nof buyout, and open-source projects becoming abandonware,\" the Open Home\nFoundation states in a press release. \"To an extent, this protection extends\neven against our future selves\u2014so that smart home users can continue to\nbenefit for years, if not decades. No matter what comes.\" Along with keeping\nHome Assistant funded and secure from buy-outs or mission creep, the\nfoundation intends to help fund and collaborate with external projects crucial\nto Home Assistant, like Z-Wave JS and Zigbee2MQTT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite video.\n\nHome Assistant's ambitions don't stop with money and board seats, though. They\naim to \"be an active political advocate\" in the smart home field, toward three\nprimary principles:\n\n  * Data privacy, which means devices with local-only options, and cloud services with explicit permissions\n  * Choice in using devices with one another through open standards and local APIs\n  * Sustainability by repurposing old devices and appliances beyond company-defined lifetimes\n\nNotably, individuals cannot contribute modest-size donations to the Open Home\nFoundation. Instead, the foundation asks supporters to purchase a Nabu Casa\nsubscription or contribute code or other help to its open source projects.\n\n## From a few lines of Python to a foundation\n\nHome Assistant founder Paulus Schoutsen wanted better control of his Philips\nHue smart lights just before 2014 or so and wrote a Python script to do so.\nThousands of volunteer contributions later, Home Assistant was becoming a real\nthing. Schoutsen and other volunteers inevitably started to feel overwhelmed\nby the \"free time\" coding and urgent bug fixes. So Schoutsen, Ben Bangert, and\nPascal Vizeli founded Nabu Casa, a for-profit firm intended to stabilize\nfunding and paid work on Home Assistant.\n\nThrough that stability, Home Assistant could direct full-time work to various\nprojects, take ownership of things like ESPHome, and officially contribute to\nopen standards like Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter. But Home Assistant was\n\"floating in a kind of undefined space between a for-profit entity and an\nopen-source repository on GitHub,\" according to the foundation. The Open Home\nFoundation creates the formal home for everything that needs it and makes Nabu\nCasa a \"special, rules-bound inaugural partner\" to better delineate the\nbusiness and non-profit sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Home Assistant as a Home Depot box?\n\nIn an interview with The Verge's Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, and in a State of\nthe Open Home stream over the weekend, Schoutsen also suggested that the\nFoundation gives Home Assistant a more stable footing by which to compete\nagainst the bigger names in smart homes, like Amazon, Google, Apple, and\nSamsung. The Home Assistant Green starter hardware will sell on Amazon this\nyear, along with HA-badged extension dongles. A dedicated voice control\nhardware device that enables a local voice assistant is coming before year's\nend. Home Assistant is partnering with Nvidia and its Jetson edge AI platform\nto help make local assistants better, faster, and more easily integrated into\na locally controlled smart home.\n\nThat also means Home Assistant is growing as a brand, not just a product. Home\nAssistant's \"Works With\" program is picking up new partners and has broad\nambitions. \u201cWe want to be a consumer brand,\u201d Schoutsen told Tuohy. \u201cYou should\nbe able to walk into a Home Depot and be like, \u2018I care about my privacy; this\nis the smart home hub I need.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere does this leave existing Home Assistant enthusiasts, who are probably\nfamiliar with the feeling of a tech brand pivoting away from them? It's hard\nto imagine Home Assistant dropping its advanced automation tools and YAML-\nediting offerings entirely. But Schoutsen suggested he could imagine a split\nbetween regular and \"advanced\" users down the line. But Home Assistant's open\nnature, and now its foundation, should ensure that people will always be able\nto remix, reconfigure, or re-release the version of smart home choice they\nprefer.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n91\n\nKevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a\nvariety of technology topics and reviewing products.
