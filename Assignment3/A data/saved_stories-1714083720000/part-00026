Radius is a\ncloud-native, cloud-agnostic application platform that the CNCF has recognized\nas having the potential to contribute to the cloud-native ecosystem.\n\nRadius empowers developers and platform engineers to collaborate easily in\ndelivering and managing cloud-native applications that align with corporate\nbest practices for cost, operations, and security. It was initiated by the\nMicrosoft Azure Incubations Team, the same group behind CNCF projects like\nKEDA (CNCF Graduated), Dapr (CNCF Incubating), and Copacetic (CNCF Sandbox).\n\nThe open-project has rapidly gained traction since its announcement in October\n2023, as Mark Russinovich writes:\n\n>   * The main Radius GitHub repository has received ~1300 stars. A total of\n> ~73 community contributors have made over ~350 contributions to Radius, both\n> for code and documentation changes across all Radius GitHub repositories.\n>   * There are ~750 members engaging in support channels at the Radius\n> Discord server.\n>   * The Radius project roadmap is updated monthly, and the Radius Community\n> Meeting is held after each monthly release.\n>\n\nSince the public release, the Radius team and community added enhancements\nlike deeper integration with Kubernetes and Helm, the introduction of the\nRadius Dashboard for visualizing application graphs, and the rollout of Radius\nsimulated environments for improved development and testing workflows.\nAdditionally, support for Terraform Recipes from private git repositories\nexpands the platform's flexibility and usability for enterprises.\n\nRadius Dashboard (Source: Radius docs)\n\nHowever, the community response to Radius has been varied. Geert Baeke, an\nAzure MVP, responded to the release on X in a tweet:\n\n> For most of our customers, it\u2019s too early. For a big part of those, it\u2019s an\n> extra layer of abstraction and complexity they do not need. I think it\u2019s a\n> great solution though and would love to use it in production to get a feel\n> for its real world applicability.\n\nAnd Carl in 't Veld, an Azure engineer at CloudNation, tweeted:\n\n> Radius separates out recipe owners and recipe users which is key in driving\n> secure self-service building blocks. The main blockers for me are: rbac,\n> gitops, git identity, terraform identity, approval flows, other hosting\n> models. This is very promising tech!\n\nLastly, more details are available on the documentation pages, and Bilgin\nIbryam, a product manager at Diagrid, tweeted:\n\n> The FAQ has a great section with comparison to other tools.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Steef-Jan Wiggers\n\nSteef-Jan Wiggers is one of InfoQ's senior cloud editors and works as an\nIntegration Architect at i8c in The Netherlands.
