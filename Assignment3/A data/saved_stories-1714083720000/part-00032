In addition to upstream improvements, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS\nhas merged low-latency kernel features into the default kernel, reducing\nkernel task scheduling delays.\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS also enables frame pointers by default on all 64-bit\narchitectures so that performance engineers have ready access to accurate and\ncomplete flame graphs as they profile their systems for troubleshooting and\noptimisation.\n\n\u201cFrame pointers allow more complete CPU profiling and off-CPU profiling. The\nperformance wins that these can provide far outweigh the comparatively tiny\nloss in performance. Ubuntu enabling frame pointers by default will be a huge\nwin for performance engineering and the default developer experience\u201d, said\nBrendan Gregg, Computer Performance Expert and Fellow at Intel. Tracing with\nbpftrace is now standard in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, alongside pre-existing profiling\ntools to provide site reliability engineers with immediate access to essential\nresources.\n\nIntegrated workload accelerators bring additional performance improvements.\nCanonical and Intel worked together to integrate Intel\u00ae QuickAssist Technology\n(Intel\u00ae QAT) for the first time ever in an LTS. Intel QAT enables users to\naccelerate encryption and compression in order to reduce CPU utilisation and\nimprove networking and storage application performance on 4th Gen and newer\nIntel Xeon Scalable processors.\n\n\u201cUbuntu is a natural fit to enable the most advanced Intel features. Canonical\nand Intel have a shared philosophy of enabling performance and security at\nscale across platforms\u201d, said Mark Skarpness, Vice President and General\nManager of System Software Engineering at Intel.\n\n## Increased developer productivity with LTS toolchains\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS includes Python 3.12, Ruby 3.2, PHP 8.3 and Go 1.22 with\nadditional focus dedicated to the developer experience for .NET, Java and\nRust.\n\nWith the introduction of .NET 8, Ubuntu is taking a significant step forward\nin supporting the .NET community. NET 8 will be fully supported on Ubuntu\n24.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS for the entire lifecycle of both releases, enabling\ndevelopers to upgrade their applications to newer .NET versions prior to\nupgrading their Ubuntu release. This .NET support has also been extended to\nthe IBM System Z platform.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased about the release of Canonical Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and the\nincreased performance, developer productivity, and security that it provides\nour joint customers,\u201d said Jeremy Winter, Corporate Vice President, Azure\nCloud Native. \u201cUbuntu is an endorsed Linux distro on Microsoft Azure, and an\nimportant component for many of Microsoft\u2019s technologies, including .NET,\nWindows Subsystem for Linux, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure confidential\ncomputing. Microsoft and Canonical have a close engineering relationship\nspanning everything from update infrastructure in Azure to developer tooling,\nnotably .NET 8 which is part of the Noble Numbat release from day one. We look\nforward to continuing our strong collaboration with Canonical to enhance\ndeveloper productivity and provide a robust experience for Ubuntu on Azure.\u201d\n\nFor Java developers, OpenJDK 21 is the default in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS while\nmaintaining support for versions 17, 11, and 8. OpenJDK 17 and 21 are also TCK\ncertified, which means they adhere to Java standards and ensure\ninteroperability with other Java platforms. A special FIPS-compliant OpenJDK\n11 package is also available for Ubuntu Pro users.\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS ships with Rust 1.75 and a simpler Rust toolchain snap\nframework. This will support the increasing use of Rust in key Ubuntu\npackages, like the kernel and Firefox, and enables future Rust versions to be\ndelivered to developers on 24.04 LTS in years to come.\n\n## New management tools for Ubuntu Desktop and WSL\n\nFor the first time in an LTS, Ubuntu Desktop now uses the same installer\ntechnology as Ubuntu Server. This means that desktop administrators can now\nuse image customisation tools like autoinstall and cloud-init to create\ntailored experiences for their developers. The user interface has also\nreceived a makeover, with a modern design built in Flutter.\n\nFor those managing mixed Windows and Ubuntu environments, the Active Directory\nGroup Policy client available via Ubuntu Pro now supports enterprise proxy\nconfiguration, privilege management and remote script execution.\n\nCanonical continues to invest in Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\nas a first class platform for developers and data scientists. Starting with\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS, Ubuntu on WSL now supports cloud-init to enable image\ncustomisation and standardisation across developer estates.\n\n## Confidential computing on the cloud and private data centres\n\nConfidential computing secures data at runtime from vulnerabilities within the\nhost privileged system software, including the hypervisor. It also protects\ndata against unauthorised access by\n\ninfrastructure administrators. Today, Ubuntu offers the most extensive\nportfolio of confidential virtual machines, available across Microsoft Azure,\nGoogle Cloud, and Amazon Web Services.\n\nUbuntu is also the first and only Linux distribution to support confidential\nGPUs on the public cloud, starting with a preview on Microsoft Azure. Building\non the silicon innovation of NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and AMD 4th Gen EPYC\nprocessors with SEV-SNP, Ubuntu confidential VMs are ideal to perform AI\ntraining and inference tasks on sensitive data.\n\nUbuntu also supports confidential computing in private data centres. Thanks to\na strategic collaboration between Intel and Canonical, Ubuntu now seamlessly\nsupports Intel\u00ae Trust Domain Extensions (Intel\u00ae TDX) on both the host and\nguest sides, starting with an Intel-optimised Ubuntu 23.10 build. With no\nchanges required to the application layer, VM isolation with Intel TDX greatly\nsimplifies the porting and migration of existing workloads to a confidential\ncomputing environment.\n\n## 12 years of support with new Ubuntu Pro add-on\n\nTo meet the needs of Canonical\u2019s enterprise customers, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS gets a\n12 year commitment for security maintenance and support. As with other long\nterm supported releases, Noble Numbat will get five years of free security\nmaintenance on the main Ubuntu repository. Ubuntu Pro extends that commitment\nto 10 years on both the main and universe repositories. Ubuntu Pro subscribers\ncan purchase an extra two years with the Legacy Support add-on.\n\nThe 12 year commitment also applies to earlier Ubuntu releases, starting with\n14.04 LTS. The LTS expansion offers benefits for individuals and organisations\nwho want to gain even more stability while building on top of Ubuntu\u2019s wide\narray of open source software libraries.\n\n## Next steps\n\n  * Download Ubuntu 24.04 LTS\n  * Read the full release notes\n  * What\u2019s new in Ubuntu Desktop \u2013 Deep Dive\n  * Read more about Legacy Support\n\n## About Canonical\n\nCanonical, the publisher of Ubuntu, provides open source security, support and\nservices.
