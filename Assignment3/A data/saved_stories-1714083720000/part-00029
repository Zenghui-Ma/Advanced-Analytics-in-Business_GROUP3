Meanwhile, we\u2019re frequently asked: How does\nCody understand my codebase? And what exactly does that mean?\n\nIn building Cody, we found that Large Language Models (LLMs), when applied to\nspecific use cases, are only as good as the context they\u2019re given. For Cody,\nthose use cases are writing, understanding, and answering questions about\ncode. Cody needs the context of a user\u2019s codebase to do those things\neffectively.\n\nThis blog unpacks why context matters and how we\u2019ve built Cody Enterprise to\nuse the right context to help you write and understand code.\n\n### Why does context matter?\n\nWhen it comes to AI chat and asking questions of an LLM, you can think of\nquestions loosely falling into two categories as they relate to context:\n\n  * General coding questions that are not dependent on a user\u2019s context\n  * Specific questions that are dependent on a user\u2019s existing code/context\n\nGeneral questions that aren\u2019t context-dependent can be answered purely based\non the LLM\u2019s training data. LLMs are typically trained on a huge corpus of\ntext, code, and other data and can answer questions by drawing information\nfrom that data.\n\nFor example, you might ask ChatGPT, \u201cIn what year was COBOL invented?\u201d or\n\u201cWhat food is the state of Wisconsin best known for?\u201d ChatGPT can answer these\nquestions easily. They aren\u2019t dependent on any context that isn\u2019t included in\nthe query itself or any information the model hasn\u2019t been exposed to.\n\nSimilarly, you might ask Cody all sorts of general knowledge coding questions,\nlike:\n\n  * \u201cHow do I build a Flask application?\u201d\n  * \u201cCan you give me a hashing algorithm?\u201d\n  * \u201cWhat are some best practices to prevent SQL injection?\u201d\n\nCody can answer all of these questions easily; all of the information required\nto answer them is incorporated in the underlying model\u2019s training data, so no\noutside context is needed for Cody to provide an answer.\n\nContext-dependent questions are trickier. For example, you can\u2019t ask ChatGPT,\n\u201cWhat color is my dog?\u201d since ChatGPT has never seen your dog. You could ask\nChatGPT to critique your resume, but only if you include that outside context,\ni.e., the actual content of your resume, alongside the question. Put simply,\nasking LLMs about things they\u2019ve never seen before confuses them.\n\nYou might ask Cody, \u201cWhat does this piece of code do?\u201d For this question, you\nneed to provide context for Cody to understand and answer the question\nentirely. For this relatively simple question, you could ask ChatGPT and paste\nin a snippet of your code as context, or you could highlight a piece of code\nin your editor and ask this question.\n\nA more specific and challenging question is, \u201cHow can I fix this error where\nthe user object is null when accessing the 'username' field?\u201d You probably\ncan\u2019t paste in a single snippet of code to answer this question, and even if\nyou could, a good coding assistant shouldn\u2019t require a developer to find all\nthe authentication code themselves.\n\nThis is where context retrieval comes in. Instead of making you find the\nrelevant pieces of code and paste them in alongside your query, Cody can\nsearch your codebase to retrieve the context that is relevant to your question\n(even if that context entails multiple files from around a codebase, including\nthose that are not even open in your editor).\n\nIn short, context and context retrieval take Cody from being able to answer\nonly general questions to also being able to answer context-dependent\nquestions, which are very common in a developer's day-to-day work. After all,\nmost software development is just about building on top of existing context.\n\n### Methods of using context: RAG vs fine-tuning\n\nTo use the context of your codebase, Cody uses a technique called RAG:\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation. RAG is a technique where an LLM generates a\nresponse using additional context that is included alongside a user request.\nIn our case, Cody programmatically retrieves context when a user submits a\nrequest. Then, it uses RAG to submit that context alongside the user request\nto the underlying model.\n\nWe\u2019re often asked about fine-tuning as a way to use context with AI, too.\nFine-tuning is a method of extending a model with additional training data\nbeyond the data used during its primary training cycle. Since models are fine-\ntuned with a point-in-time snapshot of data, they\u2019re typically fine-tuned on\ninformation that doesn\u2019t change quickly; otherwise, the fine-tuning quickly\nbecomes outdated. This is especially important to consider for dynamic data\nsources like codebases.\n\nRAG and fine-tuning are different tools for different jobs, so neither is\nstrictly better than the other. Fine-tuning is typically used to teach a model\nabout a desired form, e.g., how users want the model to act. For example,\ndevelopers might want a model to always return responses in a given format\n(e.g., preferring a given programming convention, like arrow functions) or to\nbe exceptionally good at answering a style of question not seen in the\noriginal training data. RAG is more relevant for teaching a model about\ncontent, especially content that changes over time, like code, since fresh\ncontent is retrieved at the time of invocation.\n\nToday, we use RAG to power Cody\u2019s responses. It suits that purpose well\nbecause it can use up-to-date, relevant code that is retrieved at the time\nCody is invoked. This doesn\u2019t mean Cody will never use fine-tuning in the\nfuture, but for code retrieval specifically, we find RAG to be the more\nappropriate tool for the job.\n\n### How context is used in a prompt\n\nWhen a user queries Cody (either via a chat message or a command), the first\nthing that happens is Cody compiles a prompt. Cody takes the user\u2019s input and\nmolds it into a prompt designed to get the best response back from the LLM.\nThe prompt can be divided into three parts:\n\n  * Prefix: An optional description of the desired output. Cody uses prefixes often, and one example is when a developer is triggering a command, which is a predefined task intended to return a specific output format. For instance, for the \u201cTest\u201d command, Cody is looking for an output in the format of a unit test and will use a prefix to define this.\n  * User input: The query provided by the user.\n  * Context: The additional information that Cody finds and retrieves to help the LLM provide a relevant answer.\n\nFor example, when a user triggers the \u201cExplain\u201d command in Cody, the resulting\nprompt that Cody generates to send to the LLM may look like this:\n\nPrefix:\n\n    \n    \n    Explain the following Go code at a high level. Only include details that are essential to an overall understanding of what's happening in the code.\n\nUser input:\n\n    \n    \n    zoekt.QueryToZoektQuery(b.query, b.resultTypes, b.features, typ)\n\nContext:\n\n    \n    \n    [Contents of sourcegraph/sourcegraph/internal/search/zoekt/query.go]\n\nThis full prompt, containing all three parts, is then sent to the LLM. The LLM\nworks off of the information contained in the prompt along with the\ninformation contained in its baseline model. Any questions pertaining to the\nuser\u2019s codebase will only be answerable if the context (sent as part of the\nprompt) gives the LLM enough information to address the question.\n\n### How Cody finds context from your codebase\n\nKnowing how critical context is to an LLM prompt, we still have an open\nquestion: how does Cody select the right context to send along to the LLM? We\nhave diverse context sources available between the user\u2019s IDE and code that is\nremotely stored on Sourcegraph (more on that in a second). For each of Cody\u2019s\nfeatures, we need to consider the most appropriate approach for both accuracy\nand speed.\n\n### Chat and commands\n\nFor chat and commands, it\u2019s important that Cody has access to broad context.\nIn an ideal case, this means context that spans the entire surface area of a\ncodebase that a user might want to ask a question about.\n\nThis is where Sourcegraph\u2019s Code Intelligence Platform comes in. Sourcegraph\u2019s\nunderlying platform functions as an engine that understands code. Our\ncustomers have codebases ranging from ~100 repositories on a single code host\n(like Bitbucket or GitLab) to 100,000+ repositories living across a spectrum\nof code hosts. In all of these cases, Sourcegraph indexes and understands all\nof this code.\n\nWe use this platform to power search experiences through our product Code\nSearch. Code Search uses a high-performance search engine to help developers\nsearch and navigate broad codebases in one place.\n\nNow, we\u2019re using this same underlying platform to power Cody, and we\u2019re able\nto pass information from the platform to Cody\u2019s LLM as context for\nunderstanding your codebase.\n\nWhen a user invokes Cody, they\u2019re able to select repositories they\u2019d like to\npull context from (as of this post, users can select up to 10 repositories at\na time). Cody will contact the Sourcegraph instance and run a search over the\nselected repositories.\n\nThe search request pre-processes the user query, splitting the text into\ntokens and applying a series of cleansing steps so that we are left with a\nstandardized representation without any extraneous information. That list of\ntokens is then processed by the Sourcegraph search engine, which scans the\nuser-selected repositories and ranks file snippets (a snippet is a subset of\nthe overall file) according to their relevance to the search query.\n\nTo compute relevance, Cody incorporates an adapted form of the BM25 ranking\nfunction alongside other signals learned and tuned to the specific task at\nhand. Ranking the right context at this phase is a critical piece of the\nprocess for users to get relevant answers from Cody, so we\u2019re constantly\ntuning our approach to this ranking. Once snippets are ranked, the most\nrelevant ones are sent back to the Cody client for use in the prompt context.\n\nOn top of the file snippets returned by Sourcegraph search, Cody also has\naccess to local context (the project that is open in the user\u2019s IDE). Cody\npulls snippets from open files in the IDE to add to the remotely retrieved\ncontext.\n\nCody then looks at the relevance of all the snippets provided by each context\nprovider and creates a global ranking. From this global ranking, Cody takes\nthe first N snippets returned (N being a function of the length of each\nsnippet) and packages them into the \u2018context\u2019 of the prompt it is building.\nThis context, alongside the prefix and user input, completes the full prompt\nthat Cody will then send to the LLM. The LLM will then read and consider the\nfull text of the context it receives when building a response to return to the\nuser.\n\n### What about autocomplete?\n\nAutocomplete, both inline and multi-line, uses different methods of context\nretrieval. Since autocomplete has to be extremely fast to be most useful\n(helpfully interjecting while users are typing), Cody uses algorithms that\nprioritize searching local context for autocomplete rather than running remote\nsearches on an enterprise Sourcegraph instance. Autocomplete also uses\ndifferent LLMs, favoring options that are tuned for code completion tasks and\nfor low latency.\n\nAs a user is typing, Cody is constantly evaluating the intent of the actions a\nuser is taking. Using a parsing library called Tree-Sitter, Cody can quickly\nidentify what type of completion experience will fit best into the active\nworkflow, e.g., filling in the body of a function, writing a docstring, or\nimplementing a method call. This identified intent helps Cody understand what\ncontext will best suit the task at hand.\n\nOnce intent is classified, Cody reaches out to various local context sources,\nincluding the contents of the active file, other open tabs, recently closed\ntabs, and more. Cody identifies similar or relevant sections of code from\nthese context streams that are useful reference examples to guide the\ncompletion. Like context selection for chat, Cody then packages the most\nrelevant snippets into a prompt and sends that to our completions-tuned LLM.\nThe response from the LLM is then parsed and rendered as ghost text ahead of\nthe user\u2019s cursor.\n\nOf course, this is an overly simplistic summary of completions, which is a\nspace rich with ongoing research and development. If you are interested in\nlearning more, we encourage you to check out our recent deep dive into the\nlifecycle of a completion.\n\n### So what happened to embeddings?\n\nEmbeddings have been at the backbone of Cody\u2019s retrieval stack since we\nlaunched the product in beta, and now that Cody Enterprise is generally\navailable, we\u2019re leaving them behind (for now). So why the change?\n\nFirst, as background, it\u2019s important to understand embeddings at a high level.\nSuccinctly, embeddings are a dense vector representation of high-dimensional\ndata. We previously used an embedding model (text-embedding-ada-002 from\nOpenAI) to collapse tokens (source code) into a vector. We could then run a\nvector-based retrieval system for context. When a user queried Cody, the query\nwould be converted into a vector, and that vector would be compared against\nthe vectors representing the user\u2019s codebase. This comparison would yield\nfiles and code snippets that we\u2019d use as context for Cody.\n\nWhile embeddings worked for retrieving context, they had some drawbacks for\nour purposes. Embeddings require all of your code to be represented in the\nvector space and to do this, we need to send source code to an OpenAI API for\nembedding. Then, those vectors need to be stored, maintained, and updated.\nThis isn\u2019t ideal for three reasons:\n\n  * Your code has to be sent to a 3rd party (OpenAI) for processing, and not everyone wants their code to be relayed in this way.\n  * The process of creating embeddings and keeping them up-to-date introduces complexity that Sourcegraph admins have to manage.\n  * As the size of a codebase increases, so does the respective vector database, and searching vector databases for codebases with >100,000 repositories is complex and resource-intensive. This complexity was limiting our ability to build our new multi-repository context feature.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to Cody having the best context of any coding assistant on the\nmarket, which pushed us to find a solution for these issues. We were able to\nreplace embeddings for context retrieval with Sourcegraph\u2019s native platform,\nas described in the preceding sections. This new solution doesn\u2019t require\nsending code to an embedding processor, it requires zero additional config,\nand it scales to massive codebases.\n\nAlthough we\u2019re excited about the improvements coming from this change, we\nbelieve there are likely opportunities to leverage embeddings in some form in\nthe future as we continue to improve context even further. This is an active\narea of research for us, and we are excited to share more in the future.\n\n### The future of context\n\nTL;DR, Cody Enterprise has two main ways of retrieving context today:\n\n  * For chat and commands, Cody uses a combination of local context + remote Sourcegraph search to find context from a user\u2019s entire codebase\n  * For autocomplete, Cody identifies a user\u2019s intent and then pulls local context from the IDE to generate a response extremely quickly\n\nHowever, we\u2019re constantly experimenting with new ways to improve Cody\u2019s\ncontext retrieval in various dimensions:\n\n  * Making context retrieval faster\n  * Making context retrieval more accurate (e.g., finding the most relevant files to bring to the LLM)\n  * Bringing in new sources of context\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the methods of context retrieval outlined in this post evolve\nover time just as they\u2019ve evolved since we first announced Cody last year. In\nthe future, we see an opportunity to expand Cody\u2019s total domain of knowledge\nby bringing in entirely new sources of context like wikis, docs, and\nengineering tickets. More context will open up Cody to answer more, broader\nquestions for users about parts of their work adjacent to their actual code.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to try Cody yourself, you can sign up for free.
