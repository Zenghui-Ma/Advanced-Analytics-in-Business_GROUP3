The Geologic Atlas of the Lunar Globe, which\ntook more than 100 researchers over a decade to compile, reveals a total of\n12,341 craters, 81 basins and 17 rock types, along with other basic geological\ninformation about the lunar surface. The maps were made at the unprecedented\nscale of 1:2,500,000.\n\n\u201cEvery question in geology starts with looking at a geological map,\u201d says Ross\nMitchell, a geophysicist at the CAS Institute of Geology and Geophysics in\nBeijing. The new lunar atlas is \u201creally a resource for the whole world\u201d, he\nsays.\n\nThe CAS also released a book called Map Quadrangles of the Geologic Atlas of\nthe Moon, comprising 30 sector diagrams which together form a visualization of\nthe whole Moon.\n\nJianzhong Liu, a geochemist at the CAS Institute of Geochemistry in Guiyang\nand co-leader of the project, says that existing Moon maps date from the 1960s\nand 1970s. \u201cThe US Geological Survey used data from the Apollo missions to\ncreate a number of geological maps of the Moon, including a global map at the\nscale of 1:5,000,000 and some regional, higher-accuracy ones near the landing\nsites,\u201d he says. \u201cSince then, our knowledge of the Moon has advanced greatly,\nand those maps could no longer meet the needs for future lunar research and\nexploration.\u201d\n\nChina will use the maps to support its lunar ambitions and Liu says that the\nmaps will be beneficial to other countries as they undertake their own Moon\nmissions. Three spacecraft have launched aiming for the Moon so far this year,\nand in May, China intends to send a craft to collect rocks from the Moon\u2019s far\nside.\n\nWith the updated atlas, scientists will be able to better understand the\nhistory of the Moon, evaluate potential lunar resources and conduct\ncomparative geological studies. It will also inform the location choices of\nfuture missions including where to build a lunar research base, Liu says.\n\nCarolyn van der Bogert, a planetary geologist at the University of M\u00fcnster in\nGermany, says she was impressed by the amount of work that Chinese colleagues\nhave put into compiling the new atlas.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to being able to interact with the map in a very\ndetailed way,\u201d she says.\n\n## Other-worldly cartography\n\nThe atlas, which is available in both Chinese and English, was assembled using\ndata from China\u2019s lunar exploration programme, especially the Chang\u2019e-1\nmission, which surveyed the lunar surface from orbit between 2007 and 2009,\naccording to Liu. \u201cChang\u2019e-1\u2019s camera conducted observation of lunar\ntopography and geological structures, while its interference imaging\nspectrometer played a key role in identifying different rock types,\u201d he says.\n\nObservations made on the Moon\u2019s surface by the Chang\u2019e-3 and Chang\u2019e-4 lander\nmissions in 2013 and 2019, respectively, helped to verify the accuracy of the\nChang\u2019e-1 data. The atlas team also used data from missions such as the\nGravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) and the Lunar Reconnaissance\nOrbiter, both launched by NASA, and India\u2019s Chandrayaan-1 probe. \u201cSome\nobservations were highly complementary to the Chang\u2019e missions. For instance,\nGRAIL\u2019s data helped us identify all the deep fractures on the lunar surface,\u201d\nLiu says.\n\nChinese researchers started to compile the maps in 2012 as they were searching\nfor the next targets to explore on the Moon. In partnership with Russia and\nmore than a dozen other countries and organizations, China is leading the\nconstruction of the International Lunar Research Station, which is intended to\ntake shape in the mid-2030s at the Moon\u2019s south pole for scientific\nexploration and resource exploitation.\n\n\u201cContributing to lunar science is a profound way for China to assert its\npotential role as a scientific powerhouse in the decades to come,\u201d says\nMitchell.\n\nLiu says that his team has already started work to improve the resolution of\nthe maps, and will produce regional maps of higher accuracy on the basis of\nscientific and engineering needs. In the meantime, the completed atlas has\nbeen integrated into a cloud platform called the Digital Moon, and will\neventually become available to the international research community.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01223-0\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * First private Moon lander touches down on lunar surface to make history\n\n  * Japan\u2019s successful Moon landing was the most precise ever\n\n  * Strange blobs in Earth\u2019s mantle are relics of a massive collision\n\n  * Mission failure feared for private US Moon lander \u2014 what\u2019s next?\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Astronomy and astrophysics\n  * Planetary science\n  * Geology\n\n## Latest on:\n\nA magnetar giant flare in the nearby starburst galaxy M82\n\nArticle 24 APR 24\n\nGalaxy found napping in the primordial Universe\n\nNews & Views 24 APR 24\n\nStar Formation Shut Down by Multiphase Gas Outflow in a Galaxy at a Redshift\nof 2.45\n\nArticle 22 APR 24\n\nThe Maldives is racing to create new land.
