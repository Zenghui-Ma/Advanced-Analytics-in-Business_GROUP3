Indeed, cons \u2218 dup is never well-typed, because cons\ntakes inputs of different types but dup returns outputs of identical types.\nWhat went wrong here?\n\nMore generally, suppose we have an equivalence of polymorphic families of\nmorphisms: For some objects X,Y,..., we have a diagram over those objects.\nEach commuting pair of morphisms in that diagram should be equivalent, even if\nwe paste it into a larger diagram. But not all equivalences type-check under\nsubstitution. Why not?\n\n  * category-theory\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited 1 hour ago\n\nCorbin\n\nasked 14 hours ago\n\nCorbinCorbin\n\n36222 silver badges1313 bronze badges\n\n5\n\n  * 1\n\nCould be moved to CS, TCS, or PLDI. Please note: I think I understand the\nunderlying polymorphism issues well enough to not be blocked or in need of\nhelp. Rather, I want to know exactly why multiple important principles of\ncategory theory (polymorphism, universality, diagrams, equivalences) seem to\nclash here and whether there's something deeper and non-obvious.\n\n\u2013 Corbin\n\n14 hours ago\n\n  * 3\n\nWhat are the types of nil and cons that you're using? The usage suggests that\ncons is [[X]]\u00d7[[X]]\u2192[[X]], rather than the [[X]]\u00d7X\u2192[[X]] that I'd expect.\n\n\u2013 S.C.\n\n12 hours ago\n\n  * @AlexKruckman: Operationally, yes; in models, there might only be one empty list. However, the two nil have different inferred types; one is an empty list of X, and one is an empty list of lists of X. If we try unifying the types, we'll get a unification error.\n\n\u2013 Corbin\n\n2 hours ago\n\n  * @S.C.: Fair question! I'm giving cons:X\u00d7[X]\u2192[X], although you could also flip(cons):[X]\u00d7X\u2192[X]. Note that [X] is a list of X and [[X]] is a list of lists of X.\n\n\u2013 Corbin\n\n2 hours ago\n\n  * Oh, now that you've added more details, I understand what you're asking. Isn't the obvious issue just that the equality pair(f,f)=dup\u2218f only makes sense when f names a single arrow, but when you write pair(nil,nil), the two things called \"nil\" are actually two different arrows that you've given the same name? You write \"Rather, I want to know exactly why multiple important principles of category theory (polymorphism, universality, diagrams, equivalences) seem to clash here\" - but isn't polymorphism really an important principle of computer science, not category theory?\n\n\u2013 Alex Kruckman\n\n1 hour ago\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## 0\n\nReset to default\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nBrowse other questions tagged\n\n  * category-theory\n\n.\n\n  * Featured on Meta\n  * New Focus Styles & Updated Styling for Button Groups\n\n  * Upcoming initiatives on Stack Overflow and across the Stack Exchange network\n\n#### Related\n\n5\n\nWhy not just define equivalence relations on objects and morphisms for\nequivalent categories?\n\n1\n\nDoes a categorical product make any restrictions on an object that has no\nmorphisms to one of the factors?\n\n1\n\nWhy are limits defined by terminal morphisms?\n\n3\n\nProperty of n-morphism in \"weak sense\" in higher category theory\n\n0\n\nTerminology for the restriction of the product of two morphisms to its image\n\n0\n\nGroup product in Aluffi's book\n\n#### Hot Network Questions\n\n  * How to answer pre screening question \"do you have a car\" if I currently don't but could get one?\n\n  * Data Science undergrad degree isn't what I expected to be\n\n  * Why would two different sized bikes not arrive at the same time starting from rest on the same slope?\n\n  * If an object is accelerating when it enters water, will the buoyant force change?\n\n  * Taking a scene from a video I made\n\n  * Are gate-checked bags screened for items not allowed in the hold?\n\n  * Can I enter the US with a Canadian passport, without my green card?\n\n  * Booking hotel relative to local or home timezone\n\n  * Proof explanation of result 5.11 in Linear Algebra Done Right, Sheldon Axler\n\n  * Why does a motor or ceiling fan exhibits low torque after capacitor-to-inductor swap?\n\n  * Diode clipping question on output of opamp\n\n  * Conservative cocompletion of categories of geometric shapes for homotopy theory\n\n  * Bismarck urged not to hinder Russia from going deeper into the \"oriental dead end.\" What did he mean by \"oriental dead end?\"\n\n  * Make a command robust (unbreakable)\n\n  * Can I say \"keep your head tipping backwards for 2 minutes\" to mean to keep the head still and in a state that it is fixed at a tipping position?\n\n  * How do flyback converters operating in CCM regulate their output?\n\n  * Apex (de)serialize JSON with Map<String, Object> properties\n\n  * Why does the BRK instruction set the B flag?\n\n  * How to plan a trail route?\n\n  * Unable to Understand How Current Divides in Parallel Circuits\n\n  * Can an undergraduate student be penalized for exceeding what is expected of a work?\n\n  * Why does no historian speak of the torn veil and how do we reconcile it with scripture?\n\n  * How precise should I expect to be with metronome?\n\n  * At the start of Dune, who knew about the Spacing Guild's dependence on spice?\n\nmore hot questions\n\nQuestion feed\n\n# Subscribe to RSS\n\n  * Blog\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n\nSite design / logo \u00a9 2024 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed\nunder CC BY-SA. rev 2024.4.24.8132\n\n## We Care About Your Privacy\n\nWe and our 4 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
