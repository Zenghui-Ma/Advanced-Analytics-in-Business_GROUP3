In this paper, we describe the\narchitecture of MemoryDB and how we leverage open-source Redis, a popular data\nstructure store, to build an enterprise-grade cloud database. MemoryDB\noffloads durability concerns to a separate low-latency, durable transaction\nlog service, allowing us to scale performance, availability, and durability\nindependently from the in-memory execution engine. We describe how, using this\narchitecture, we are able to remain fully compatible with Redis, while\nproviding single-digit millisecond write and microsecond-scale read latencies,\nstrong consistency, and high availability. MemoryDB launched in 2021.\n\nResearch areas\n\n  * Cloud and systems\n\nTags\n\n  * Databases\n\n### Conference\n\n  * SIGMOD 2024\n\n## Latest news\n\n  * Virtual try-all: Visualizing any product in any personal setting\n\nKarim Bouyarmane\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nFirst model to work across a wide range of products uses a second U-Net\nencoder to capture fine-grained product details.\n\nComputer vision\n\n  * A quick guide to Amazon's 20+ papers at ICASSP 2024\n\nStaff writer\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nThis year\u2019s papers address topics such as speech enhancement, spoken-language\nunderstanding, dialogue, paralinguistics, and pitch estimation.\n\nConversational AI\n\n  * Using Amazon web traffic to track the eclipse\n\nKenny Shirley\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nAn animation that projects traffic fluctuations onto the U.S. map offers an\nexample of how the Supply Chain Optimization Technologies team uses data\nvisualization to glean insights.\n\nOperations research and optimization\n\n## Work with us\n\nSee more jobs See more jobs\n\nSenior Economist, Economic Decision Science\n\nGB, London\n\nEconomic Decision Science is a central science team working across a variety\nof topics in the EU Stores business and...
