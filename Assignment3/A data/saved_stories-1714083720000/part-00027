The purpose of this review is to provide\n> an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a\n> manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by\n> covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-\n> variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient\n> descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and\n> unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models,\n> deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization,\n> energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann\n> Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many\n> natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of\n> the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern\n> ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the\n> Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton-\n> proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible\n> uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical\n> world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to\n> contribute.
