Conventional methods such as surveys are limited by their sampling\n> scope, time efficiency, and expense. On the other hand, crowdsourcing\n> through online platforms presents an opportunity for decision-makers to tap\n> into a user-generated source of information that is widely available and\n> cost-effective. To demonstrate such potential, we collect Google Maps\n> reviews for 23,906 points of interest (POIs) in Atlanta, Georgia. Next, we\n> use the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model\n> to classify reviewers' attitudes toward urban density and the Robustly\n> Optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa) to compute sentiment. Finally, a partial\n> least squares regression is fitted to examine the relationships between\n> average sentiment and socio-spatial factors. The findings reveal areas in\n> Atlanta with predominantly negative sentiments toward urban density and\n> highlight the variation in sentiment distribution across different POIs.\n> Further, the regression analysis reveals that minority and low-income\n> communities often express more negative sentiments, and higher land use\n> density exacerbates such negativity. This study introduces a novel data\n> source and methodological framework that can be easily adapted to different\n> regions, offering useful insights into public sentiment toward the built\n> environment and shedding light on how planning policies can be designed to\n> handle related challenges.\n\nSubjects:| Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.13156 [cs.SI]  \n(or arXiv:2404.13156v1 [cs.SI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.13156arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Lingyao Li [view email] [v1] Fri, 19 Apr 2024 19:49:25 UTC (5,820 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Crowdsourcing public attitudes toward local\nservices through the lens of Google Maps reviews: An urban density-based\nperspective, by Lingyao Li and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
