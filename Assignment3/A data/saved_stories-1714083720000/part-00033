Researchers write that, prior to the experiment, they had\n591 participants answer a political questionnaire that provided insights into\ntheir political beliefs. Those same participants were then scanned by\nresearchers\u2019 AI algorithm, which attempted to assess where they fell on the\npolitical spectrum. The algorithm could generally tell what a person\u2019s\npolitical orientation was with a high degree of accuracy, even when that\nperson\u2019s identity was \u201cdecorrelated with age, gender, and ethnicity,\u201d\nresearchers write. The \u201calgorithm\u2019s predictive accuracy was even higher\u201d when\nit had access to \u201cparticipants\u2019 age, gender, and ethnicity,\u201d researchers\nwrite. The levels of accuracy were broken down in different situations and\nexpressed in formulas, but the researchers summarized it as being \u201con par with\nhow well job interviews predict job success, or alcohol drives\naggressiveness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nWhat's The Point of Expanding Album Covers with AI?\n\nMicrosoft Exec Says AI Is \u2018a New Kind of Digital Species\u2019\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Creator Buddies Up to Congress | Future Tech\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Creator Buddies Up to Congress | Future Tech\n\nPrior to this experiment, researchers studied the \u201cdifferences between average\nfacial outlines\u201d of the \u201cmost liberal and most conservative males and females\u201d\nand integrated this research into their analysis. According to this\nanalysis\u2014and, I have to warn you, it\u2019s kinda funny\u2014liberals and conservatives\nhave markedly different facial morphology. Liberals have \u201csmaller lower faces\u201d\nand \u201clips and noses [that] are shifted downward,\u201d and chins that \u201care smaller\u201d\nthan conservatives, researchers write. Researchers repeat the key conclusion\nlater on: \u201cliberals tended to have smaller faces.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, according to this theory, if you have a tiny face, you\u2019re probably a\nprogressive. Or, by contrast, if you have a big fat face, there\u2019s a good\nchance you might be a Trump voter. Face/head is destiny, apparently.\nResearchers justify this assessment by pointing to the ways in which social\nexpectations relative to physical appearances can influence personality\ndevelopment:\n\n> ...facial appearance can shape psychological traits...People largely agree\n> when judging political orientation from faces (Todorov et al., 2015).\n> Regardless of whether such judgments are accurate, the self-fulfilling\n> prophecy effect (Merton, 1936) postulates that people perceived as having a\n> particular attribute are treated accordingly; internalize such attributions;\n> and, over time, may engage in behaviors consistent with others\u2019 perceptions\n> (Slepian & Ames, 2016). For example, people with larger jaws, often\n> perceived as more socially dominant (a trait associated with political\n> conservatism), might over time become more so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce researchers had established this alleged correlation between specific\nfacial morphologies and political orientations, they could create a database\nof faces that fall into those distinct categories and test their facial\nrecognition algorithm to see if it could accurately predict which faces were\ncorrelated with specific political orientations. According to them, it worked.\n\n\u201cWe demonstrate that political orientation can be predicted from neutral\nfacial images by both humans and algorithms, even when factors like age,\ngender, and ethnicity are accounted for. This indicates a connection between\npolitical leanings and inherent facial characteristics, which are largely\nbeyond an individual\u2019s control,\u201d the study claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers went on to say, \u201cMost crucially, our findings suggest that\nwidespread biometric surveillance technologies are more threatening than\npreviously thought.\u201d Especially in the case of targeting political messaging\nonline, the ability of AI to guess a person\u2019s political orientation could be\nvery valuable.\n\nSo, in conclusion: If your face is large, you\u2019re a conservative; if it\u2019s\nskinny, you\u2019re a liberal; and facial recognition is bad\u2014we all know that. That\nseems to be all you need to know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
