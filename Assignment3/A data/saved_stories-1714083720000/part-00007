But in the United States, scientists\nare setting out to see whether seaweed has another particularly valuable trick\nhidden up its proverbial sleeve: to act as a salty, slimy source of precious\nminerals.\n\nWithin the US Department of Energy is the Advanced Research Projects Agency-\nEnergy (ARPA-E), a scientific branch devoted to tackling challenging, high-\nrisk projects on energy technologies. ARPA-E takes big swings and looks for\nbig rewards. And so far, the agency has awarded US $5-million to three\nventures investigating whether seaweed can serve as a practical source of\ncritical materials, such as platinum and rhodium, as well as rare earth\nelements, including neodymium, lanthanum, yttrium, and dysprosium.\n\nThese valuable elements, which can be captured and concentrated by seaweed,\nare essential to the green energy transition\u2014and to technology more broadly.\nSeaweed could represent an alternative to conventional mining and other\nprospects, such as deep-sea mining.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of complexities in the entire process, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s in\nthe category of \u2018very exploratory,\u2019\u201d says Schery Umanzor, a seaweed expert at\nthe University of Alaska Fairbanks and a lead researcher on one of the\nprojects funded by ARPA-E. \u201cThe chances of success are low. But if we succeed,\nthen the implications are huge.\u201d\n\nTwo key principles underlie this research, Umanzor says. For one, seaweed\ngrows quickly and sucks minerals out of the water to do so. For two, seaweed\u2019s\ncell walls are structured from sulfated polysaccharides\u2014compounds made of long\nchains of sugar molecules. Sulfated polysaccharides are negatively charged,\nmeaning they attract positively charged minerals floating nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s pure\nchemistry,\u201d Umanzor says. \u201cPositive with negative, and then it just collects.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, Scott Edmundson, at the US Department of Energy\u2019s Pacific\nNorthwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, began digging into\nwhether seaweed could store valuable minerals. He\u2019d come across a paper\ndescribing how rare earth elements were accumulating in seaweed in polluted\nareas along Morocco\u2019s Atlantic coast and was struck by the potential.\n\nReading about seaweed\u2019s natural propensity to sieve minerals from seawater\nsparked a \u201cwacky idea\u201d to test how far the process could go, Edmundson says.\nSo he and other PNNL scientists ran an experiment to see if they could\ndeliberately grow seaweed to take up minerals. The project\u2014which was also\nfunded by ARPA-E\u2014finished last year, though they\u2019re continuing to dig into the\ntopic. So far, the team\u2019s work suggests that seaweed can be processed to\nproduce a carbon-rich component used in concrete or biofuel manufacturing and\na second mineral component containing elements such as phosphorus.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns, says Edmundson. Different seaweeds appear to have\ndistinct mechanisms for getting minerals out of seawater and unique ways of\nincorporating or concentrating them in their tissues. \u201cThere\u2019s layers upon\nlayers of variability that are unclear at the moment,\u201d he adds.\n\nUnderpinning all of this research are important, unanswered questions,\nincluding why seaweed absorbs these minerals at all, whether it can do so in\nconcentrations high enough to be useful, and whether the elements can be\npulled out in a financially viable way.\n\nThe key to making all this work, says Umanzor, is figuring out how to extract\nmetals and rare earth elements from seaweed without destroying it. For seaweed\nmining to make financial sense, the process needs to leave the algae in good-\nenough condition to still be used for other applications, including as fuel,\nfood, or a component in bioplastic production.\n\nAnother crucial piece of the puzzle is finding the right spot to grow the\nseaweed. Despite their name, rare earth elements are not all that rare. These\nand other critical minerals are present throughout the ocean in tiny amounts.\nYet there are areas where they likely exist in higher concentrations\u2014like\ndownstream from large deposits on land. That\u2019s why Umanzor and her\ncollaborators are examining if rare earth elements are sloughing off Bokan\nMountain in southeast Alaska and ending up in the ocean, and whether growing\nseaweed in a nearby bay can snag what runs off. Bokan Mountain is being\nconsidered for conventional mining, but if it works, seaweed extraction could\noffer a more sustainable alternative.\n\nSusete Pint\u00e9us, a marine biologist at the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria in\nPortugal, coauthored a 2022 review paper on seaweed\u2019s role in the green energy\ntransition. She says seaweed extraction alone\u2014if it works\u2014cannot completely\neliminate conventional mining for these metals because the demand is so great.\n\u201c[Seaweeds] can contribute,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they will not solve the problem\nthemselves.\u201d\n\nEven though seaweed collection can\u2019t fully replace mining, Umanzor says that\nby extracting materials as they leach naturally out of the land\u2014as they might\non Bokan Mountain\u2014algal mining offers a way to scoop up minerals that were\ngoing to be lost to the sea.\n\nUmanzor never imagined that the humble seaweed could become a vessel to\ncapture valuable materials. But in this role, it might support a more\nsustainable future.\n\n\u201cMetals have to come from somewhere, and extracting them is very destructive,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cIt\u2019s worth exploring other possibilities that align more with our\nideas of a greener world\u2014or a bluer world.\u201d\n\n### Article footer and bottom matter\n\n### Share this article on social media\n\nShare this\n\nTweet this\n\nFlip this\n\n### Sign up for the weekly newslstter\n\n### Sign up for our free weekly newsletter\n\n### Additional Contributors\n\n#### Edited by:\n\nColin Schultz\n\n### Author bio\n\nMoira Donovan is an independent journalist and radio producer based on the\nEast Coast of Canada, with a body of work focused on the environment and\nclimate change.
