The prognosis was seemingly hopeless, to say the least. \u201cIt was very,\nvery bad at the time. It basically shattered our world,\u201d Yu recalls with a\nheavy heart. Despite the devastating news, she didn\u2019t give up the search for\nhope.\n\nYu started spending \u201c5 hours or 6 hours a day\u201d looking into every new study,\nupdate, and announcement regarding clinical trials. This search for hope\nbecame her mission, yet it came at a big personal cost. Precious moments that\ncould have been spent making memories with her husband were instead spent\nsearching for a lifeline.\n\nYu\u2019s story is a reflection of a challenge faced by countless people worldwide.\nFinding and getting into clinical trials is hard and emotionally draining.\nThere is a critical need for a more straightforward, easier approach to\nconnect patients with potentially life-saving trials.\n\nDriven by her own experience, Yu eventually joined forces with Clinical Net,\nan online platform that changes how people find clinical trials. Clinical Net\nuses artificial intelligence to look at over 72,000 ongoing clinical trials,\nto match patients and healthy volunteers with the most suitable clinical\ntrial. \u201cDoctors are incredibly busy, handling numerous patients and may not\nalways have the ability to explore every potential trial.

The trial team, the candidate and the candidate\u2019s medical team are\nautomatically connected to share details of the clinical trial and discuss the\noption of starting the pre-enrollment process.\n\nThis quick method directly addresses the difficulties Yu faced, offering hope\nmore quickly to those needing it. This represents a significant advancement in\nenhancing patient care and speeding up medical research.\n\nBy simplifying the search for clinical trials, Clinical Net not only speeds up\nthe path to hope and treatment but also shows a huge advancement in patient-\ncentered care and research.
