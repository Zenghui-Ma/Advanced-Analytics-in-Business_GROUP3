The more\ndesperate the fight, the more experimentation is accelerated. Some of these\ncreations can be revolutionary, some can be incremental successes, but the\nmajority are total failures. And, yes, many of them can be pretty damn weird.\nCase in point, this turtle shell-like contraption that just showed up on the\nbattlefield in Ukraine \u2014 a shed-like steel apparatus that covers the entire\nRussian tank concealed beneath it. This early ironclad-looking vehicle is a\nproduct of a desperate search for a defense against marauding first-person\nvideo (FPV) drones that have been raining hellfire on both sides of the front\nlines.\n\nNext to nothing is known about this modification, but what's clear is that it\ncovers nearly the entire tank and massively restricts its situational\nawareness, field of fire, and mobility while installed.\n\nAfter the initial drone footage of the tank moving along with a convoy first\nemerged, close-up footage of it in a garage surfaced, which shows a crude\ntrapezoidal steel structure with its tacked-on supports. It isn't clear if\nnetting or chain link fencing was installed at its front and rear after this\nwas shot, but it would make sense considering its intended use. The tank has a\nmine plow, which could have been why it was picked for this modification, as\nde-mining operations activity slows down the vehicle, which also leads the way\nfor other armor. This would make it the top target for enemy drones.\n\nThis appears to be the current extreme evolution of the 'cope cage' that first\nappeared shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, the threat from\nlower-end drones, both FPV types and those that drop bomblets from above, has\nabsolutely exploded in magnitude and frequency. The once improvised cope cages\non tanks are now being seen on other types of armor in increasingly complex\nconfigurations. They are also showing up around the world, including in\nIsrael, and factory production versions of them are becoming export options\nfor some armor types. They also appear to be popping up on very different\nkinds of non-armored vehicles, possibly including submarines.\n\nThe advent of highly maneuverable FPV suicide drones has resulted in the\naforementioned larger and more elaborate cages, as the drones can fly at\nshallow angles under the cages and even into vehicle hatches and doors. This\nlatest configuration goes a long way in limiting the ability of such drones to\nmake an easy attack, but in doing so, it makes the tank largely useless and\npossibly a bigger liability than an asset.\n\nIt's hard to imagine there can be anything more elaborate than this when it\ncomes to improvised armor focused on countering low-end drones, but there is\nalways something even more bizarre waiting around the corner, at least as long\nas this horrific war continues.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nIt looks like the Turtle Tank may have had a very short life:\n\nContact the author: tyler@twz.com\n\nArmiesAround The GlobeDronesEuropeRussiaRussian ArmyTanksUkraine\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
