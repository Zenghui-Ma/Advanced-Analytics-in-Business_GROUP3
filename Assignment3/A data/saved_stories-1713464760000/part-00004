It was just days ago talking about AlmaLinux\nrestoring old hardware support that's been deprecated by upstream Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux. Now over on the Rocky Linux side, CIQ as the principal\norganization behind them is rolling out support for upstream Linux kernels.\n\nCIQ announced this week that they will be supporting upstream stable kernels\ninto Rocky Linux. They wrote in a press release:\n\n> \"CIQ, the company building the next generation of software infrastructure\n> for enterprises, today launched fully supported, upstream stable kernels for\n> Rocky Linux via the CIQ Enterprise Linux Platform, providing enhanced\n> performance, hardware compatibility and security.\n>\n> The new offering from CIQ was built to meet the ultra-high performance,\n> compatibility and security needs of the most advanced customers, and is now\n> available to everyone. Development of the new offering stemmed from a\n> storage use case where leveraging the large PCIe footprint of AMD EPYC\n> processors was critical. Since then, additional use cases have emerged as\n> organizations are realizing benefits of the upstream kernels.\"\n\nUnfortunately though there isn't much public information available regarding\ntheir upstream kernel support plans on Rocky Linux. Additionally, it appears\nthat the upstream kernel endeavor on Rocky Linux may be gated to their\ncommercial customers as opposed to making all the assets freely available and\njust gating their commercial support. In any event great seeing Rocky Linux\nsupporting the option of upstream kernels for those wanting to ride the latest\nupstream innovations, performance improvements, and new hardware support for\nthose not concerned about being on a RHEL-compatible kernel.\n\nPerformance and speed, broader hardware compatibility, and security were among\nthe expressed reasons for the interest in upstream kernel support on Rocky\nLinux.\n\n2 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nAlmaLinux 9.4 Beta Restores Support For Some Hardware Deprecated By RHEL\n\nGentoo Linux Now An SPI Project\n\nLinux Mint Aims For More Reliable & Faster Repository Access\n\nCachyOS Making Use Of Plymouth For Better Boot Experience, Mitigates For XZ\nFiasco\n\nLinux Mint 22 Will Use The PipeWire Sound Server, Support JPEG-XL Images\n\nSerpent OS Hopes To Ship Pre-Alpha ISOs In The Coming Weeks\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
