The Open Source Security (OpenSSF) and\n> OpenJS Foundations are calling all open source maintainers to be alert for\n> social engineering takeover attempts, to recognize the early threat patterns\n> emerging, and to take steps to protect their open source projects.\n\nVigilance is good, and it\u2019s worth heeding the advice and paying attention to\nthe evidence presented here. The XZ Utils backdoor was a smart attack that\nvery nearly caused havoc.\n\nI think it\u2019s also worth pointing out that we know about the exploit because it\nwas in an open source project. Andres Freund was debugging a server resource\nissue when he uncovered the issue. Because the project \u2014 and its downstream\nclient \u2014 were open source, he could investigate and find the intrusion.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how this would have panned out if this had been proprietary\nsoftware: particularly on a team that was resource strapped or moving at\nspeed. The same social engineering exploits that allowed Jia Tan to become a\nmaintainer of the XZ Utils project would also see someone hired as a\ncontractor by a tech team. If I was a nefarious actor who wanted to place an\nexploit in an important software library, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d do: go send\nsomeone to join the team as a contractor. While there are mandatory identity\nverification procedures for full-time employees (which we can certainly argue\nthe pros and cons of), contractors have no such requirements.\n\nI bring this up because all the advice I\u2019ve seen to date has been directed at\nopen source maintainers. Again, this is smart and good and should absolutely\nbe heeded \u2014 but there\u2019s a world of other software out there that is also\ncritical infrastructure and which doesn\u2019t enjoy the sunlight of open source\nprojects. This isn\u2019t an open source software problem; it\u2019s a software problem.\nEveryone should be vigilant, regardless if there are eyes on their source code\nor not. And perhaps we should be even warier of projects whose code we can\u2019t\naudit ourselves.\n\n42 minutes ago \u00b7 Asides \u00b7 Share this post\n\nShare this post on social media.\n\nI\u2019m writing about the intersection of the internet, media, and society.
