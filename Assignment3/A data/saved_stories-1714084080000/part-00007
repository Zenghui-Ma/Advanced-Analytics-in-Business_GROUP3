A good data visualization can save hours, days, or\neven weeks of development time by providing insights that would be hard to\nglean from purely numerical summaries of data.\n\nThis week, we had an opportunity to use our data visualization expertise to\ntrace the path of the 2024 North American solar eclipse. We measured traffic\nto the Amazon website on eclipse day, April 8, during the roughly four-hour\npassage of the eclipse across the US, at a \u201czip3\u201d spatial resolution (that is,\nusing the first three digits of a zip code). Our hypothesis was that during\nthe eclipse, people would pause their daily routines (including online\nshopping) to go outside and look at the sky. Comparing our eclipse-day traffic\nmeasurements to a baseline level, measured from prior, non-eclipse dates,\nconfirmed our hypothesis: we could easily trace the path of the eclipse, from\nTexas to Maine.\n\nTo make things more interesting, we animated our visualization by binning our\ndata into 10-minute bins. The result was the animation above, which shows\ntraffic anomalies to our website between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. EDT on\nMonday. The movement of the moon across the eclipse path in the US is easily\nvisible!\n\nThis is just one example of how well-crafted visualizations can bring data to\nlife and instantly yield information that would be hard to extract from even\nthe most sophisticated numerical summary.\n\nResearch areas\n\n  * Operations research and optimization\n\nTags\n\n  * Demand forecasting\n  * Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT)\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKenny Shirley\n\nKenny Shirley is a principal research scientist with Amazon's Supply Chain\nOptimization Technologies organization.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * Optimizing neural networks for special-purpose hardware\n\nSankalp Dayal, Mahdi Heydari\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nCurating the neural-architecture search space and taking advantage of human\nintuition reduces latency on real-world applications by up to 55%.\n\nCloud and systems\n\n  * New tool, dataset help detect hallucinations in large language models\n\nXiangkun Hu, Dongyu Ru\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nRepresenting facts using knowledge triplets rather than natural language\nenables finer-grained judgments.\n\nConversational AI\n\n  * The science behind Echo Frames\n\nStaff writer\n\nApril 09, 2024\n\nHow the team behind Echo Frames delivered longer battery life and improved\nsound quality inside the slim form factor of a pair of eyeglasses.\n\n## Work with us\n\nSee more jobs See more jobs\n\nSenior Economist, Economic Decision Science\n\nGB, London\n\nEconomic Decision Science is a central science team working across a variety\nof topics in the EU Stores business and...
