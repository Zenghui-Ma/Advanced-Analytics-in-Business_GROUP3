Last\nyear, the company worked with Okta, a cybersecurity firm, to build a \u201csign in\nwith Worldcoin\u201d authentication service, which developers could use as an\nalternative or in addition to similar tools by Apple and Google, according to\nBloomberg.\n\nThree Arrows participated in Tools for Humanity\u2019s $25 million funding round in\nOctober 2021 that valued the company at $1 billion, according to data from\nfunding tracker Dealroom. FTX cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried was an early\ninvestor as well.\n\n## What is Worldcoin?\n\nAccording to its website, Worldcoin a \u201cfree, privacy-preserving, open protocol\nintended to be the world\u2019s largest identity and financial public network.\u201d\n\nIt hopes to authenticate one\u2019s \u201chumanness\u201d in an age of bots and deepfakes by\nasking users to stare into an orb, which then converts one\u2019s biometric image\ninto an impenetrable string of numbers. When combined with an algorithm, the\ncode verifies an individual as a unique human, providing confirmation via a\nWorld ID, which is stored in one\u2019s World App. As a reward for the scan, users\ncan be airdropped Worldcoin tokens, which are currently priced around $5.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s not whether there will be proof of personhood\u2014the\nquestion is, will it be open-source, decentralized, and privacy preserving?\u201d\nTiago Sada, head of product for Tools for Humanity, previously told Fortune.\n\nBut the Orbs have been banned in various European countries over concerns\nabout data harvesting; Germany is the only market where Worldcoin is currently\nable to collect biometrics. Moreover, others have noted how Altman, the\ncofounder and chairman of Tools for Humanity, is selling a solution to issues\naccelerated by another of his companies, OpenAI.\n\nThe rate of new interest in the plan remains unclear, as the market cap of\nWorldcoin tokens has almost halved over the past month, to around $942\nmillion, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nIn a bid to expand adoption, Worldcoin Foundation, the company behind\nWorldcoin, last week announced World Chain, a permissionless, open-source\nlayer-2 that\u2019s expected to launch mid-2024. The blockchain will be deeply\nentwined with the Worldcoin protocol and will give preferential treatment to\nusers with a World ID.\n\nLearn more about all things crypto with short, easy-to-read lesson cards.\nClick here for Fortune's Crypto Crash Course.\n\n## Latest in Crypto\n\n  * 2 hours ago\n  * Companies - Sam Altman\n\n## Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin eyeing partnerships with PayPal and OpenAI\n\nBYNiamh Rowe\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n  * 2 hours ago\n  * Companies - cryptocurrency\n\n## Movement Labs raises $38 million to build layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum\nwith Facebook tech\n\nBYLeo Schwartz\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n  * 4 hours ago\n  * Newsletters - Fortune Crypto\n\n## Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block is the most interesting company in crypto right now\n\nBYJeff John Roberts\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Regulators - cryptocurrency\n\n## DOJ seeks 3-year sentence\u2014double federal guidelines\u2014for Binance\u2019s Changpeng\nZhao\n\nBYNiamh Rowe\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Newsletters - Fortune Crypto\n\n## Former SEC crypto lawyer bumps into the revolving door\n\nBYLeo Schwartz\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * The Coins - Bitcoin\n\n## Old Bitcoin wallets keep waking up: How many of the 1.8 million \u2018lost\u2019\ncoins are really gone?\n\nBYJeff John Roberts\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Tech\n\n## On a crucial earnings call, Musk reminds the world Tesla is a tech company.\n\u2018Even if I\u2019m kidnapped by aliens tomorrow, Tesla will solve autonomy\u2019\n\nBYPaolo Confino\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Tech\n\n## Spotify CEO Daniel Ek surprised by how much laying off 1,500 employees\nnegatively affected the streaming giant\u2019s operations\n\nBYRyan Hogg\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Personal Finance\n\n## A 60-year-old worker in Texas says she\u2019s dependent on apps that let her get\npaid early: \u2018They get you hooked on having that money\u2019\n\nBYCora Lewis and The Associated Press\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Finance\n\n## The outlook for home prices has changed drastically in just the past month\nas Fed rate cuts look more and more distant\n\nBYJason Ma\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Finance\n\n## American Airlines changes its frequent flyer rules\u2014again\n\nBYChris Morris\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * 6 days ago\n  * Health\n\n## Your reusable water bottle may be a breeding ground for strep and fecal\nbacteria.
