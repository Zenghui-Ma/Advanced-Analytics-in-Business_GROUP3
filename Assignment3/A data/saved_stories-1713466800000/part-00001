What is the best way to cope with such\nhigh temperatures?\n\nTarly, a 52-year-old carpenter, has seen his colleagues faint due to the heat\nin his home suburb of Abobo in Ivory Coast in recent months. \u201cThe first thing\nI do when I wake up is shower. But when I get on the gbakka [a popular urban\nminibus], I\u2019m already sweating, and it stays that way until the afternoon.\u201d\n\nAlthough he does not have \u201ccooling breaks\u201d at work, he says colleagues\noccasionally pause to drink coffee or tea.\n\nThis year, west Africa was hit by a searing heatwave, with the most severe\nheat occurring from 11-15 February, and temperatures peaking above 40C and\naveraging 36C.\n\nAccra, Ghana. The national meteorological organisation warned of extreme heat.\nPhotograph: Truba7113/Shutterstock\n\nHumidity was also high, making it harder for people to cool down by sweating.\nThe heat index, a measure combining temperature and humidity to reflect how\nheat feels, reached 50C. \u201cThat is very dangerous for the human body,\u201d said\nIzidine Pinto, a researcher in weather and climate extremes at the Royal\nNetherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\nWasiu Adeniyi Ibrahim, an official at the Nigerian Meteorological Agency,\nsaid: \u201cThe February heatwave happened early in the year, meaning many people\nwould not have been acclimatised to the heat. With every fraction of a degree\nof global warming, heatwaves like this will become even hotter.\u201d\n\nGlobally, last month was the hottest February recorded, the ninth month in a\nrow that such a record has been broken. Carbon emissions, which continue to\nrise, and the return of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon have driven the high\ntemperatures.\n\nMeteorological organisations in Nigeria and Ghana issued warnings about the\nhigh temperature but many of the other countries affected did not prepare for\ndangerous heat.\n\nMaja Vahlberg, a risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre,\nsaid: \u201cMany people do not appreciate the dangers of heat [but high\ntemperatures] are silent killers. They can be incredibly deadly for the\nelderly, people with existing health conditions and outdoor workers. Roughly\nhalf of the west African population also lives in informal housing, rendering\nmillions of people highly vulnerable to extreme heat.\u201d\n\nPeople separate cocoa beans at a farm in San Pedro, western Ivory Coast. The\nsearing temperatures have damaged crops. Photograph: Luc Gnago/Reuters\n\nFarmers in Ivory Coast said in February the high temperatures and lack of rain\nwere damaging crops. In March, cocoa factories in the country, and in Ghana,\nstopped or reduced processing because they could not afford to buy the beans,\nReuters reported. The price of cocoa beans has risen to an unprecedented high\nof more than $8,000 a tonne, more than three times the price in March 2020.\n\nA study published this week by the World Weather Attribution group of\nscientists found that the heatwave would have happened less than once a\ncentury in a world without the climate crisis. Instead, it was a once-a-decade\nevent, with an average of 1.2C of global heating over the past four years.\n\nThe heat affected millions of people but the number of early deaths or cases\nof illness are unknown, due to a lack of reporting. The WWA report used\nweather data and climate models to compare the frequency and intensity of the\nheatwave in today\u2019s heated planet with that in a world without global heating,\na well-established methodology used in hundreds of studies.\n\nTarly\u2019s neighbour found the heat difficult, too. The film-maker Richard Lamah\nsaid they had had to adapt their shooting schedules to the temperature.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Down to Earth\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe planet's most important stories.

His colleagues were starting to\nwork in indoor spaces with ventilation as well as \u201ctaking breaks to cool off\nand even taking a shower\u201d in the middle of the shoot.\n\nAt home, it was more of the same. \u201cNeither I nor my children sleep well\nbecause of the heat; we feel like there\u2019s no air,\u201d he said.\n\nA street market in Lagos, Nigeria. The intense heat has made it difficult to\nwork. Photograph: peeterv/Getty/iStockPhoto\n\nIn Lagos, the most populous city in Nigeria, people continued to struggle with\nthe high temperatures, even after the heatwave eased. Yussuf, a resident,\nsaid: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to work. I feel dehydrated all day, so I have to\nkeep stopping to drink water.\u201d\n\nThe heat is affecting his work because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the same strength to\ngo out for walks\u201d, and his job involves travelling around the country and\nconducting field visits.\n\nTarly in Ivory Coast added: \u201cAll I can do is open the windows and the door to\nlet the air flow, but even the air doesn\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nHe lives with a one-year-old child, who cries at night because he is hot, and\nhis two teenage daughters, who wake up in the middle of the night to shower\nbefore returning to bed where they lie in front of the fan. Still, the heat\nclings; it does not go away.\n\n\u201cAt four in the morning, it\u2019s when it\u2019s least hot and you can sleep better,\nbut I have to wake up to go to work,\u201d Tarly said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s this hot, mixed\nwith humidity, time stands still.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Ivory Coast\n  * Nigeria\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Africa\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Desert city of Dubai floods as heaviest rainfall in 75 years hits UAE\n\n21h ago\n\n  * ### Strasbourg court\u2019s Swiss climate ruling could have global impact, say experts\n\n5d ago\n\n  * ### World Bank must take \u2018quantum leap\u2019 to tackle climate crisis, UN expert says\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Human rights violated by Swiss inaction on climate, ECHR rules in landmark case\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### MPs accuse Charity Commission of legal breach over climate sceptic thinktank\n\n5 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### US banks \u2018sabotaging\u2019 own net zero plans by livestock financing, report claims\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Millions go hungry as a billion meals binned every day, says UN report\n\n27 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Geologists reject declaration of Anthropocene epoch\n\n22 Mar 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
