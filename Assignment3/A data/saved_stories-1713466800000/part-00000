Scientists who use\necoacoustics to measure habitats and species say that quiet is falling across\nthousands of habitats, as the planet witnesses extraordinary losses in the\ndensity and variety of species. Disappearing or losing volume along with them\nare many familiar sounds: the morning calls of birds, rustle of mammals\nthrough undergrowth and summer hum of insects.\n\nToday, tuning into some ecosystems reveals a \u201cdeathly silence\u201d, said Prof\nSteve Simpson from the University of Bristol. \u201cIt is that race against time \u2013\nwe\u2019ve only just discovered that they make such sounds, and yet we hear the\nsound disappearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe changes are profound. And they are happening everywhere,\u201d said US\nsoundscape recordist Bernie Krause, who has taken more than 5,000 hours of\nrecordings from seven continents over the past 55 years. He estimates that 70%\nof his archive is from habitats that no longer exist.\n\nProf Bryan Pijanowski from Purdue University in the US has been listening to\nnatural sounds for 40 years and taken recordings from virtually all of the\nworld\u2019s main types of ecosystems.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe sounds of the past that have been recorded and saved represent\nthe sounds of species that might no longer be here \u2013 so that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.\nThe recordings that many of us have [are] of places that no longer exist, and\nwe don\u2019t even know what those species are. In that sense they are already\nacoustic fossils.\u201d\n\nBurned trees at Lassen Volcanic national park, California, August 2023. More\nintense wildfires are destroying ecosystems.

A 2021 study in the journal Nature of\n200,000 sites across North America and Europe found \u201cpervasive loss of\nacoustic diversity and intensity of soundscapes across both continents over\nthe past 25 years, driven by changes in species richness and abundance\u201d. The\nauthors added: \u201cOne of the fundamental pathways through which humans engage\nwith nature is in chronic decline with potentially widespread implications for\nhuman health and wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe shift in ecosystem sound is happening in the air, the forests, the soil,\nand even under the water. During the cold war, the US navy used underwater\nsurveillance systems to track Soviet submarines \u2013 and found they struggled to\ndo so near coral reefs due to all the sounds reefs produced. It wasn\u2019t until\n1990 that civilian scientists could listen to this classified data.\n\n\u201cWhenever we went to a healthy reef it blew our minds \u2013 the cacophony of\nsounds we heard,\u201d said Simpson, who has been monitoring coral reefs using\nhydrophones for more than 20 years. \u201cA healthy reef was a carnival of sound.\u201d\n\nAt the outset of his research, noise pollution from motorboats was his main\nconcern, but 2015 and 2016 brought significant bleaching events, which\nresulted in 80% mortality of corals. \u201cThey cooked the reef,\u201d he said. More\nthan half of the world\u2019s coral reef cover has now been lost since 1950. If\nglobal heating reaches 2C, more than 99% of coral reefs are expected to start\ndying.\n\nThe result of these bleaching events is a \u201cdeathly silence\u201d, said Simpson. \u201cWe\nswam around those reefs crying into our masks.\u201d\n\nMass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. Photograph: Brett Monroe\nGarner/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThese sounds and silences speak back to us like in a mirror,\u201d said Hildegard\nWesterkamp, a Canadian sound ecologist who has been recording soundscapes for\nhalf a century, during which time wildlife populations have experienced\naverage declines of almost 70%.\n\nShe started working on the World Soundscape Project in 1973 with the intention\nof documenting disappearing ecosystems. \u201cWe proposed to start to listen to the\nsoundscape, to everything, no matter how uncomfortable it may be \u2013 how\nuncomfortable the message.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cThe act of listening itself can be both comforting and highly\nunsettling. But most importantly it tends to connect us to the reality of what\nwe are facing.\u201d\n\nSound data is now being used alongside visual data as a way to monitor\nconservation efforts and ecosystem health. More sophisticated and cheaper\nrecording equipment \u2013 as well as increasing concerns about environmental\ndestruction \u2013 are driving the boom in ecoacoustic monitoring.\n\nTell us how the sound of nature is changing in your local area\n\nRead more\n\nAs the sophistication of microphones has increased, scientists are using them\nto monitor life that would not usually be audible to human ears. Marcus\nMaeder, an acoustic ecologist and sound artist from Switzerland, has been\ninvestigating the noises trees make under stress, pushing a microphone into\nthe bark of a tree to listen to the living tissue. Stress sounds like pulses\ncome from within the cavity, he said.\n\nWhen he first pushed a microphone into the soil of a mountain meadow he\ndiscovered it was also alive with noise, \u201ca completely new kingdom of sounds\u201d.\n\nIntensively managed agricultural land, often doused with pesticides, sounds\nvery different, Maeder said: \u201cThe soil becomes quiet.\u201d\n\nResearchers listening to soundscapes in the soil to learn more about its\nbiodiversity. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nFor many researchers, disappearing soundscapes are a source of grief as well\nas of scientific interest. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad thing to be doing, but it\u2019s also\nhelping me tell a story about the beauty of nature,\u201d said Pijanowski. \u201cAs a\nscientist I have trouble explaining what biodiversity is, but if I play a\nrecording and say what I\u2019m talking about \u2013 these are the voices of this place.\nWe can either work to preserve it or not.\n\n\u201cSound is the most powerful trigger of emotions for humans. Acoustic memories\nare very strong too. I\u2019m thinking about it as a scientist, but it\u2019s hard not\nto be emotional.\u201d\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters\nPhoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Biodiversity\n  * Soundscapes\n  * Coral\n  * Endangered habitats\n  * Endangered species\n  * Animals\n  * Conservation\n  * Wildlife\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
