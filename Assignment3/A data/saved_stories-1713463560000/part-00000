For those that\nmissed it, the key takeaway is that EKS extended support will cost 6x what\nstandard support did. The switch to extended support occurred on January 31\nfor v1.24, and will go into effect on May 1 for v1.25, June 11 for v1.26, and\nJuly 24 for v1.27. For some organizations, these could result in a significant\nincrease in cloud costs. These cost increases impact budgeting but also bring\ngreater attention to version control as a critical responsibility for FinOps\nteams.\n\n## Understanding AWS Extended Support Price Increases\n\nRecent changes to the AWS pricing model for extended support services\nintroduced new cost dynamics for businesses that rely on EKS. The control\nplane, critical to Kubernetes clusters, now costs $0.60 per hour per cluster\nfor EKS as opposed to the normal $0.10. Kubernetes and EKS release three to\nfour versions per year and EKS typically offers 14 months of standard support\nafter the release date. That means you need to have a continuous process in\nplace for updating your clusters to ensure that you stay on supported EKS\nversions.\n\nEKS extended support automatically gives you an extra year to catch up if you\nfall behind, but it\u2019s not a comfortable spot to be in because of the\nadditional costs. Plus, you will need to upgrade eventually. Amazon EKS does\nsend a notice through the AWS Health Dashboard about 12 months after the\nKubernetes version was released on Amazon EKS, which includes the end of\nsupport date (about 60 days from the date of notice).\n\n## FinOps, Version Control, and Cost Management\n\nBased on these extended support fees, version control becomes an important\naspect of financial operations in technology-driven companies. FinOps teams\nmust now navigate these price increases, working to ensure that EKS is in\nstandard support to avoid the high costs associated with extended support.\nThis change underscores the importance of considering AWS end of service life\nmanagement as an aspect of financial planning, yet another reason to embrace\nFinOps when it comes to cloud infrastructure cost management.\n\n### Build a Business Case for Upgrades\n\nWhile the hit of extended support costs presents a challenge, it\u2019s also an\nopportunity for organizations to reevaluate their cloud infrastructure and\nupgrade processes. By identifying the need for an upgrade as an investment\nrather than a basic cost, FinOps teams can create a compelling business case\nfor keeping their technology stack up to date with newer versions. This\nperspective will help organizations avoid extended support fees and ensure use\nof the latest features and improvements in Kubernetes.\n\n### The Cost of Inaction\n\nThere are tangible costs associated with remaining on outdated versions after\nstandard support expires. Platform engineering teams can leverage extended\nsupport fees as a clear metric that demonstrates the financial impact of\ninaction, showing a quantifiable incentive for pursuing timely upgrades,\nwhether that is completed in-house or through a service provider .\n\n## Operational Efficiency, Compatibility, and Performance\n\nBeyond cost avoidance, upgrading to an EKS version in standard support offers\nsignificant benefits in terms of operational efficiency, compatibility with\nnewer software in the cloud native ecosystem , and performance. Outdated\nversions may have performance limitations that cause increased latency and\nreduced throughput. Plus, running unsupported versions makes it harder to get\nhelp from a community that\u2019s currently focused on the latest version of\nKubernetes. And using the latest supported version enhances security because\nit includes the newest security patches to protect your infrastructure against\nnewly disclosed vulnerabilities and evolving threats.\n\n### Simplify Upgrades and Operations\n\nFor businesses strained by the constant cycle of Kubernetes upgrades and\nrelated operational tasks, managed services offer a compelling alternative.\nOutsourcing the management of Amazon EKS services to a dedicated team of\nKubernetes experts can alleviate the stresses of version control, allowing\nbusinesses to focus on their core activities, accelerate their time-to-market,\nand deploy applications with confidence.\n\n### Offload the Upgrade Cycle\n\nManaged service providers specialize in maintaining up-to-date infrastructure,\nensuring that businesses can benefit from the latest AWS features without the\nchallenges of managing the upgrade process with internal resources. For many\norganizations, K8s upgrades require time from your senior engineers to\nprepare, research, and test before rolling out the changes. Leveraging managed\nservices both minimizes the risk of paying extended support fees and enables\ninternal resources to focus your organization\u2019s strategic initiatives.\n\n### Eliminate the Pager Burden\n\nBeyond upgrade management, managed services can also take on the operational\nresponsibilities associated with cloud infrastructure, including on-call\nduties for your infrastructure. It can be difficult to hire the right person\nto carry responsibility for the pager, because you need a site reliability\nengineer who is experienced enough to handle all your organization\u2019s internal\nneeds who is also willing to carry a pager. Outsourcing responsibility for\nyour Kubernetes infrastructure ensures that your infra is quiet and secure ,\nso you can skip those 3 AM pages if there\u2019s an infrastructure issue.\n\n## Transform an EKS Challenge into a FinOps Opportunity\n\nAWS's extended support price increases illustrate a change in how businesses\nneed to manage their cloud infrastructure management. By viewing version\ncontrol as a key FinOps responsibility and approaching EKS upgrades as\nstrategic investments, engineering teams can navigate these changes to better\nmanage cloud spend and Kubernetes infrastructure. Partnering with a managed\nservice provider can help organizations quickly upgrade to a supported version\nof EKS, improving reliability, security, and cost efficiency.\n\n### Talk to a K8s expert about how to manage your EKS upgrades and control\ncloud costs effectively.\n\nExplore Managed Kubernetes\n\n  * Fairwinds Insights\n\n    * Insights Overview\n    * Features\n    * Pricing and FAQ\n    * Documentation\n    * Support\n  * Open Source\n\n    * Polaris\n    * Polaris Upgrade\n    * Goldilocks\n    * Open Source User Group\n  * Solutions\n\n    * Compliance\n    * Cost Optimization\n    * Developer Enablement\n    * Kubernetes Guardrails\n    * Kubernetes Security\n    * Managed Kubernetes\n  * About\n\n    * Company\n    * Team\n    * Careers\n    * News\n    * Partners\n  * Resources\n\n    * Customer Stories\n    * Blog\n    * Library\n    * Kubernetes Maturity Model\n  *     * Fairwinds is the trusted software and services partner for running and optimizing mission-critical applications on Kubernetes.\n    * Contact Us\n\n\u00a92024 Fairwinds Ops, Inc., 1337 Massachusetts Avenue, Ste 274, Arlington, MA\n02476|Privacy Policy|Responsible Disclosure|Terms Of Use\n\n", "frontpage": true}
