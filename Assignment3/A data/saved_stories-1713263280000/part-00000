You can also\nfinally continue a past conversation by restoring it from an API call.\n\n\u179f\u17bd\u179f\u17d2\u178a\u17b8\u1786\u17d2\u1793\u17b6\u17c6\u1790\u17d2\u1798\u17b8, happy Khmer New Year! I\u2019ve also added custom Khmer fonts as a\nless noticeable change. I was encouraged by initial successes with ChatGPT\nbeing able to find the right Khmer word for me to use. You see, the current\nKhmer textbook I\u2019m studying was written for people who haven\u2019t learned the\nscript yet, and so it spells out Khmer words in an Anglicized fashion. For\nexample, the book tells me that the Khmer word for \u201cinstead\u201d is \u201cjum-neurh.\u201d\nBut using the Latin alphabet to represent Khmer words makes it hard for me to\nknow exactly what sounds are expected in the pronunciation, and makes it\nimpossible for me to recognize the word when I read it in a piece of Khmer\ntext.\n\nSometimes, as in the case of \u201cjum-neurh\u201d, my usual online dictionaries at\ndict.antkh.com and dictionary.tovnah.com won\u2019t list the specific word I\u2019m\nlooking for as a translation of \u201cinstead.\u201d ChatGPT, on the other hand, was\nindeed able to guess that the word was \u1787\u17c6\u1793\u17bd\u179f:\n\nBut then it was unable to figure out that \u201cbee-jayng\u201d for MSG in Khmer is\nactually \u1794\u17ca\u17b8\u1785\u17c1\u1784:\n\n(\u1794\u17ca\u17b8\u1785\u17c1\u1784 does not appear on either antkh or tovnah. These online dictionaries\ndo have somewhat spotty coverage of Khmer words.)\n\nWhenever I correct ChatGPT on its Khmer, it always responds as if it knew that\nall along. \u201cAh, yes, it is indeed commonly used in this manner!\u201d I was curious\nhow true this actually was:\n\nOkay, so it actually has no clue whatsoever. Oh well. Khmer fonts are added\nanyways, even if it looks like I won\u2019t be asking ChatGPT about Khmer for a\nwhile.\n\nThere\u2019s also other small tweaks, like getting the settings page columns to\nlook neat and aligned, and to show the dedication upfront rather than waiting\nuntil the credits finish scrolling:\n\nBehind the scenes, I started using SSIM for test screenshot comparisons to cut\ndown on test flakiness, because WebKit somehow doesn\u2019t render text with the\nsame exact kerning every single time. As such, I suppose I\u2019m not technically\nalerted anymore if a single pixel changes, but I should be alerted if enough\npixels change for a screenshot to look noticeably different.\n\nMeanwhile, to implement the list of API calls, I had to create a page that\nlists out all the API calls for the user to click on:\n\nTo do that properly, I had to make the list scrollable. I could\u2019ve just fallen\nback on the browser default of having the whole page be scrollable instead,\nbut that doesn\u2019t fit my desired aesthetics.\n\nTo do that properly, I should reuse the scrollable implementation I made for\nthe chat component. But that implementation was baked directly into the chat\ncode, so I had to refactor out that scrollable code to make it usable across\ndifferent components. (Refactoring refers to the process of reorganizing and\ndecluttering your code so that new parts can be added without too much hassle.\nIn this case, refactoring meant extricating code that was enmeshed with one\ncomponent, so that the same code could now be reused across different\ncomponents in the app.) For what it\u2019s worth, I did find out about Melt UI\nafterwards \u2014 although even if I had used it, I would\u2019ve still had to implement\nscroll shadows and infinite scroll callbacks myself.\n\nTo do that conveniently, it seemed best to upgrade to SvelteKit 2, which\nallows for non-module exports from child components. Fortunately, this one\nwent off without a hitch. The battery of tests I have accumulated over time\nreally paid off by giving me high confidence that all was well despite the\nunusually silent upgrade.\n\nThis sort of cascade of problems happens to me quite frequently while coding,\nand I am slightly embarassed to say that I sometimes approach real life\nproblems this way as well. Two years ago, I was living in Phnom Penh in an\napartment that had poor air conditioning. The room would feel warm even with\nthe AC at full blast. The landlord of course said that there\u2019s nothing wrong\nwith the AC, that this is simply as good as it gets in the building. This\nbeing the first time I\u2019ve encountered such a problem, I thought the best\nsolution would be to splurge on a second portable AC to add to the room. Lo\nand behold, the AC hose came up just short of the window:\n\nReturns in Cambodia aren\u2019t really a thing, especially once you\u2019ve opened the\nbox. So I went back to the store, and they told me that while they don\u2019t have\nany longer hoses, they could sell a second hose of the same length to me. I\nbought that second hose, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a good way to connect\nboth hoses together, so I just duct-taped them. This setup technically worked,\nbut because the hose is so fat, the window had to be opened wide. Now there\u2019s\nso much warm air coming in from outside that the AC isn\u2019t really making much\nof a difference.\n\nTo deal with that, I ordered a window seal that\u2019s designed to solve exactly\nthis problem for portable ACs. I also ordered a tube end that minimizes the\namount the window needs to be open by. The result did finally turn out to give\nme a more tolerable temperature inside the room on hot days:\n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have a picture of the entire final contraption, but it\nlooked janky as hell. Next time this situation crops up, I wager I\u2019ll just get\nmyself a large fan.\n\nOutside of coding, I\u2019ve fully settled into my new life in Siem Reap. Unlike\nAustralia, it took all of two days to find and sign a lease for an apartment I\nliked, and all I had to do was to provide my passport and payment for the bond\n+ first month\u2019s rent. I got a one year self-employment business visa here,\nwhich again unlike Australia took only two weeks, my passport, and the visa\nprocessing fee. I don\u2019t know why this society is so implicitly trusting in\nthis particular way, without even so much as a background check on me, but I\ndon\u2019t personally mind it of course.\n\nAfter I finished procuring the usual essentials for my apartment, I started\nlearning Khmer again, this time at Be Like Khmer. I have to say, I much prefer\nthis school over the IFL that I studied at two years ago. It\u2019s not that the\nIFL is bad, it\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t get to learn as much informal daily speak\nthere. I\u2019d learn things like \u178f\u17be\u17a2\u17d2\u1793\u1780\u179f\u17bb\u1781\u179f\u1794\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1799\u1787\u17b6\u1791\u17c1? (the equivalent of \u201cHow do\nyou do today, sir?\u201d) rather than \u1794\u1784\u179f\u17bb\u1781\u179f\u1794\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1799? (the equivalent of \u201cHow are ya\ndude?\u201d). Okay, I exaggerate slightly \u2014 they didn\u2019t actually teach us to use\nthe \u178f\u17be there, although they did teach us to use it in other questions. Also,\nas a proper university, they\u2019re perhaps more concerned about preparing you for\nbusiness meetings than preparing you to hang out with randos on the street.\n\nI\u2019m proud to say that my progress is finally paying off somewhat. I\nsuccessfully conversed enough in Khmer to know that I didn\u2019t want to buy a\nmotorbike from one particular shop, then to get the motorbike I did buy fixed,\nand finally to schedule an appointment with the cleaning lady. It\u2019s not much,\nbut at least I no longer feel completely helpless when talking to someone who\ndoesn\u2019t know English. It\u2019s more common here in Siem Reap than in Phnom Penh,\nwhich I actually kind of enjoy as someone trying to learn the language,\nbecause back in Phnom Penh the person I\u2019m talking to would usually switch to\nEnglish as soon as I hit any difficulty talking in Khmer, and I would also be\ntoo diffident to insist on talking in broken Khmer. I feel this unspoken\nsocial pressure to use the easiest mode of communication available. But when\nthe easiest mode of communication is conversing in Khmer, as difficult as that\nmight be for both of us, I no longer feel as if I have to choose between\npracticing Khmer or making things harder on the other person.\n\nSpeaking of motorcycle shops, I did end up buying my first motorbike, a used\n50cc Honda Giorno. It\u2019s perhaps a bit concerning that the one time I took a\nmotorcycle course back when I lived in Seattle, I failed it. In my defense,\n80% of my class failed too. In the instructor\u2019s defense, he usually has a 97%\npass rate, and was also perplexed at why our batch in particular did so\npoorly. Anyways, I\u2019ve been practicing riding a lot, and have gotten much more\ncomfortable with casual rides to nearby spots in the neighborhood. April is\nthe hottest month in Cambodia, and this year temperatures have been regularly\nreaching 40C and above, with humidity making it feel like 45C and above.\nRiding a scooter instead of walking has been a major improvement in my quality\nof life. And of course, it\u2019s fitting for ZAMM to include motorcycles, although\nI clearly have yet to actually learn any motorcycle maintenance.\n\nI also did my taxes for 2023. Even back when I was a high earner, I never\nreally minded paying my taxes because my family used to be poor enough that I\ngot free healthcare as a sickly child from Medicaid for children, and I got\nfree college from a combination of federal and state aid that was actually\nenough to cover all of my tuition, rent, and food. In a way, I\u2019m perhaps a\nposter child for how government investment into public welfare programs can\npay for itself many times over in the long run, and I do wish most Americans\ncould also get the free education and healthcare that I was so fortunate to\nreceive. So I don\u2019t mind paying my taxes, but I do hate the process of having\nto scrounge up all the different tax documents from each financial institution\nI\u2019ve interacted with over the last year, and I do hate that at least some of\nthe difficulties around tax preparation come from lobbying efforts by TurboTax\nand H&R Block.\n\n(Also, when I had trouble accessing certain details about my past year\u2019s\nreturn, TurboTax\u2019s customer service hotline nonchalantly explained to me that\n\u201call bets are off\u201d if I\u2019m trying to access my account from overseas.\nSeriously, billions in revenue every year, and you can\u2019t even be arsed to\nsupport overseas access? Needless to say, I did my taxes with a small\naccounting business this year.)\n\nAt this point, this blog is starting to also become a personal chronicle of\nhow I\u2019ve spent my time and effort outside of ZAMM. But the original impetus\nfor that was due to a lack of validation from visible progress on the project.\nWriting about life outside of ZAMM is a way of reminding myself that I have\nactually been quite productive in life overall, in ways that I absolutely do\ncare about. From my time in the tech industry, I\u2019m quite familiar with the\nneed for performance visibility \u2014 the idea that it\u2019s not just the work you do\nthat matters, it\u2019s also how your contributions come across to others. In a\nsense, you\u2019re not hired to be a productive employee, you\u2019re casted to play the\nrole of a productive employee. A great way to play that role is to actually be\nproductive, of course, but part of the job is also making sure that you\u2019re\nbeing perceived as productive.\n\nThis may seem like such corporate bullshit \u2014 and it is \u2014 but think about it\nfrom the boss\u2019s perspective too. None of us have raw direct access to reality.\nReality is always filtered through our perceptions, and we are forced to make\ndecisions based on these flawed perceptions. We don\u2019t live in external\nreality, we live in an internal reality reconstructed from our biased\nperception filters \u2014 and so in a sense, perception is reality for us. Even if\nyou have an honest boss, when it comes time for them to recommend someone for\na promotion, they can only go off of how good of an employee they perceive you\nto be, not how good of an employee you actually are. (What does it even mean\nto say how good you \u201cactually\u201d are, when you yourself also have a flawed\nperception of how good of an employee you are to the organization?)\n\nA good, skilled boss may be better at perceiving than an unskilled boss, but\n\u201cbetter\u201d is never going to be perfect. A less cynical view of managing your\nperformance visibility is that you\u2019re helping to shore up your boss\u2019s\ninevitable shortcomings in perceptive abilities. But of course, the more\ncynical interpretation is that this is now just an adversarial signalling game\nto be played. You try your best to send signals that you\u2019re an excellent\nemployee, and your boss does their best to determine whether you actually are\nthe excellent employee you present yourself as, or whether you are just better\nat playing the game than others. (This assumes that the boss even cares about\nwho is best at doing their job, as opposed to who is best at currying favors\nwith the boss, which I\u2019ve heard is common for Cambodian government officials.)\nGame theoretic incentives means that others are likely to defect to play the\nsignaling game too, and you opt out at your own detriment.\n\nThis gets worse the further up the hierarchy you go. Your manager may spend a\nlot of time around you, but his manager? And their manager? Imagine yourself\nas the entire organization itself. (An organization is just another cybernetic\nsystem, with its own feedback loops, environmental perceptions and actions,\nsurvival, and death.) Just as we humans don\u2019t know anything about ourselves by\ndefault (a lot of ancient people thought the heart was the source of\ncognition), an organization doesn\u2019t know anything about its members by\ndefault. There is a need for legibility. As introduced in Seeing Like A State,\nthis is a need to reduce complicated reality down to a few bits of information\nthat are simple enough for the bureaucracy to act on.\n\nLegibility is the means by which the organization perceives reality. If the\norganization wants to perceive more, then reality may have to be warped to\nmeet the organization\u2019s perception needs. Do your peasants have a complicated\nsystem of land sharing that works for them? No matter, reduce all the\npeasants\u2019 informal agreements down to a proper one-to-many mapping of people\nto property. The State needs to collect its taxes; how can it do so\neffectively if it is unable to perceive who is or isn\u2019t rich enough to pay up\nmore? And how can it perceive if the arrangements are too messy for the\nstate\u2019s limited bureaucratic manpower to deal with?\n\nDo your employees generally do honest work in ways that help progress the\norganization\u2019s goals? No matter, make everyone spend multiple days (multiple\nweeks if they want a promotion) writing essays on their own accomplishments as\nwell as those of their peers. The Company needs to know exactly how much to\nreward or nudge each employee; how can it do so effectively if it is unable to\nperceive who is or isn\u2019t being productive? How can it do so objectively, so as\nto avoid giving undue influence to one\u2019s direct manager, if it is unable to\nperceive an employee\u2019s productivity from multiple perspectives? (Google has in\nfact recently streamlined its performance review process somewhat, so perhaps\nthere wasn\u2019t such a strong need for such comprehensive reporting after all.\nEven \u201cneeds\u201d can potentially be falsely perceived as such.)\n\nBut perceiving reality is a slippery business. Act on your perceptions, and\nthose responsible for your perceptions react to you. Goodhart\u2019s law comes into\nplay: \u201cWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d As\nsoon as a metric becomes the name of the game, everyone tries to game that\nvery metric into uselessness. The dictator\u2019s trap is perhaps a more individual\nversion of this, wherein an extreme of concentration power acts like a black\nhole that bends and warps all the information flowing into it, causing the\ndictator to live in a fantasy reality and make decisions that are only\ncoherent within that fantastical inner reality.\n\nI\u2019ve been aware of this sort of phenomenon for some time now, but I didn\u2019t\nexpect it to crop up for myself when I\u2019m dealing with just myself. I know\nmyself and the work I\u2019ve done better than anyone else, and yet when I look at\nwhat I really care about from ZAMM \u2014 which is what I can personally use ZAMM\nfor \u2014 I see that very little has budged. In writing about all that\u2019s gone on\nunder the hood, and all that\u2019s gone on beyond the confines of this project, I\nmake the rest of everything else much more legible to myself. It reminds me\nthat there is a whole lot going on in life, and perhaps I needn\u2019t be concerned\nor despondent over the fact that a couple of hours spent on ZAMM per day\nresults in slow visible progress. It\u2019s probably worth examining why I feel the\nneed to maintain an internal narrative of personal progress in the first\nplace, but 1) that\u2019s a subject for another blog post, and 2) so long as I do\nfeel such a need, it feels worthwhile to challenge the misperception of\nstagnation.\n\n\u00a9 2024 ZAMM Consulting, LLC.\n\nGo to the zamm.dev GitHub profile\n\n", "frontpage": false}
