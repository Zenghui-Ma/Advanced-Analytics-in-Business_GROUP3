A subset of finalists will be\nselected to present their projects virtually and will have their work\nspotlighted on the NeurIPS homepage. In addition, the leading authors of up to\nfive winning projects will be invited to attend an award ceremony at NeurIPS\n2024 in Vancouver.\n\nEach submission must describe independent work wholly performed by the high\nschool student authors. We expect each submission to highlight either\ndemonstrated positive social impact or the potential for positive social\nimpact using machine learning. Application areas may include but are not\nlimited to the following:\n\n  * Agriculture\n  * Climate change\n  * Education\n  * Healthcare\n  * Homelessness\n  * Hunger\n  * Food security\n  * Mental health\n  * Poverty\n  * Water quality\n\nAuthors will be asked to confirm that their submissions accord with the\nNeurIPS code of conduct and the NeurIPS code of ethics.\n\nSubmission deadline: All submissions must be made by June 27th, 4pm EDT. The\nsystem will close after this time, and no further submissions will be\npossible.\n\nWe are using OpenReview to manage submissions. Papers should be submitted\nhere. Submission will open June 1st. Submissions under review will be visible\nonly to their assigned program committee. We will not be soliciting comments\nfrom the general public during the reviewing process. Anyone who plans to\nsubmit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update)\ntheir OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline.\n\nFormatting instructions: All submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions\nare limited to four content pages, including all figures and tables;\nadditional pages containing only references are allowed. You must format your\nsubmission using the NeurIPS 2024 LaTeX style file using the \u201cpreprint\u201d option\nfor non-anonymous submission. The maximum file size for submissions is 50MB.\nSubmissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or\nfont sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review. Papers may\nbe rejected without consideration of their merits if they fail to meet the\nsubmission requirements, as described in this document.\n\nMentorship and collaboration: The submitted research can be a component of a\nlarger research endeavor involving external collaborators, but the submission\nshould describe only the authors\u2019 contributions. The authors can also have\nexternal mentors but must disclose the nature of the mentorship. At the time\nof submission, the authors will be asked to describe the involvement of any\nmentors or external collaborators and to distinguish mentor and collaborator\ncontributions from those of the authors. In addition, the authors may\n(optionally) to include an acknowledgements section acknowledging the\ncontributions of others following the content sections of the submission. The\nacknowledgements section will not count toward the submission page limit.\n\nProof of high school attendance: Submitting authors will also be asked to\nupload a signed letter, on school letterhead, from each author\u2019s high school\nconfirming that the author was enrolled in high school during the 2023-2024\nacademic year.\n\nSupplementary artifacts: In their submission, authors may link to\nsupplementary artifacts including videos, working demonstrations, digital\nposters, websites, or source code. Please do not link to additional text. All\nsuch supplementary material should be wholly created by the authors and should\ndirectly support the submission content.\n\nReview process: Each submission will be reviewed by anonymous referees. The\nauthors, however, should not be anonymous. No written feedback will be\nprovided to the authors.\n\nUse of Large Language Models (LLMs): We welcome authors to use any tool that\nis suitable for preparing high-quality papers and research. However, we ask\nauthors to keep in mind two important criteria. First, we expect papers to\nfully describe their methodology. Any tool that is important to that\nmethodology, including the use of LLMs, should be described also. For example,\nauthors should mention tools (including LLMs) that were used for data\nprocessing or filtering, visualization, facilitating or running experiments,\nor proving theorems. It may also be advisable to describe the use of LLMs in\nimplementing the method (if this corresponds to an important, original, or\nnon-standard component of the approach). Second, authors are responsible for\nthe entire content of the paper, including all text and figures, so while\nauthors are welcome to use any tool they wish for writing the paper, they must\nensure that all text is correct and original.\n\nDual submissions: Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that\nthe authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-\nreviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS.\nPapers previously presented at workshops or science fairs are permitted, so\nlong as they did not appear in a conference proceedings (e.g., CVPRW\nproceedings), a journal, or a book. However, submissions will not be published\nin formal proceedings, so work submitted to this call may be published\nelsewhere in the future. Plagiarism is prohibited by the NeurIPS Code of\nConduct.\n\nPaper checklist: In order to improve the rigor and transparency of research\nsubmitted to and published at NeurIPS, authors are required to complete a\npaper checklist. The paper checklist is intended to help authors reflect on a\nwide variety of issues relating to responsible machine learning research,\nincluding reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact.\nThe checklist does not count towards the page limit and will be entered in\nOpenReview.\n\nContact: highschool@neurips.cc\n\nSuccessful Page Load\n\nNeurIPS uses cookies to remember that you are logged in.
