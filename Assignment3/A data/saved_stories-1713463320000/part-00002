They believe they\ncan hide behind digital identities and platforms such as LabHost and have\nabsolute confidence these sites are impenetrable by policing.\n\n\"But this operation and others over the last year show how law enforcement\nworldwide can, and will, come together with one another and private sector\npartners to dismantle international fraud networks at source.\"\n\nAdrian Searle, director of the National Economic Crime Centre in the NCA,\nsaid: \"This operation again demonstrates that UK law enforcement has the\ncapability and intent to identify, disrupt and completely compromise criminal\nservices that are targeting the UK on an industrial scale.\"\n\n## Sky News Footer\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n\n### About Sky News\n\n  * About Us\n  * Sky News Profiles\n  * Sky News International\n  * Sky News Library Sales\n  * Site Map\n  * Editorial Guidelines\n  * Sky News Board\n\n### Sky News Services\n\n  * Sky News RSS\n  * Sky News For Your Phone\n  * Sky News Radio\n\n### Sky Channels\n\n  * Sky Witness\n  * Sky Atlantic\n  * Sky Arts\n  * Sky Cinema\n  * Sky Sports\n\n### More Sky Sites\n\n  * NOW\n  * Sky Zero\n  * Sky Academy Studios\n  * Bigger Picture\n  * Sky Group\n  * Sky Bet\n  * Sky.com\n  * Sky News Arabia\n  * Advertise With Us\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * Privacy Options\n  * Accessibility\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sky UK\n\n", "frontpage": false}
