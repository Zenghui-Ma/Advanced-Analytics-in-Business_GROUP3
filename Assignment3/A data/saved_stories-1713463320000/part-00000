The Met said\narrests were made at Manchester and Luton airports, and in Essex and London.\n\nPolicing in the UK is under pressure to show it is successfully tackling the\nexplosion in cyberfraud.\n\nThe infiltration of the site is a relative drop in the ocean compared to the\nscale of the problem, but police hope to shatter the confidence of criminals\nwho believe they can act with impunity, and plan to take down more cyberfraud\nsites.\n\nFraud and cybercrime are seen as difficult to solve within policing amid\nbattles for resources against other crime priorities such as protecting\nchildren and boosting what is widely seen as inadequate protection of women.\n\nFor now, the Met is celebrating its success. In the UK, 25,000 victims have\nbeen contacted and arrests of the site\u2019s main users have taken place. However,\nsome of those who used it will not be detained as their real identity remains\nunknown to investigators.\n\n\u2018Many-shot jailbreak\u2019: lab reveals how AI safety features can be easily\nbypassed\n\nRead more\n\nLabHost amassed 480,000 debit or credit card numbers, 64,000 pin numbers and\nmade \u00a31m from membership fees alone from 2,000 people, which were up to \u00a3300 a\nmonth for membership, to be paid in cryptocurrency. It advertised itself as a\n\u201cone-stop-shop for phishing\u201d.\n\nIt offered a tutorial video on how to use the site to commit crime, similar to\na video on how to use a new consumer product. The video said the software took\nfive minutes to install, and offered \u201ccustomer service\u201d if there were any\nproblems. It ended by wishing its criminal users to: \u201cStay safe and good\nspamming.\u201d\n\nDI Oliver Richter said five years ago a cyber fraudster would need technical\nskills, like being able to code. Now users are in their late-teens to\nlate-20s.\n\nHe said: \u201cA lot of these users, they are younger, they\u2019re at university, they\nare very likely to go on to perhaps perfectly legitimate careers.\n\n\u201cThey see this, because it is so easy to do, as something that is anonymous.\n\n\u201cThey are entering into this, I think, not fully understanding the risks and\npotential outcomes.\u201d\n\nAfter the site was disrupted, 800 users received a message telling them that\npolice \u201cknow who they are and what they\u2019ve been doing\u201d.\n\nPolice did not reveal how they gained entry to the inner workings of the site,\nwhich occurred in June 2022.\n\nDet Supt Helen Rance, head of the Met\u2019s cybercrime unit, said taking down the\n\u201cincredibly slick\u201d LabHost was part of a Met effort to target those who\n\u201cindustrialised\u201d crimes like fraud and 17 forces across the world were\ninvolved, as well as the private sector.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to infiltrate this service so we could see those\nresponsible for it and the scale of the operation.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Internet\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
