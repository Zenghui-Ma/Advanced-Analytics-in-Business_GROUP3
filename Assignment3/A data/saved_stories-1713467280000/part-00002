When the price of something goes up, producers bring more to\nmarket. What, then, is going on in global stockmarkets?\n\nGlobal share prices have never been higher, having risen by 14% over the past\nyear. At the same time, the supply of stocks is shrinking. As analysts at\nJPMorgan Chase, a bank, note, the pace of company listings is slower this year\nthan last, and last year was already a slow one. This means that equity\nissuance net of stock buy-backs so far this year is already negative, at minus\n$120bn\u2014the lowest such figure since at least 1999. Companies including\nByteDance, OpenAI, Stripe and SpaceX have valuations in the tens or even\nhundreds of billions of dollars, and remain private.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get unlimited access to The Economist\n\n### Explore all our independent journalism with a one-month free trial.
