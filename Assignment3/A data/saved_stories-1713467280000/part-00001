Here we report on the discovery of a second\nsurangular from the lower jaw of a giant ichthyosaur from Somerset, UK. The\nnew find is comparable in size and morphology to a specimen from Lilstock,\nSomerset, described in 2018, but it is more complete and better preserved.\nBoth finds are from the uppermost Triassic Westbury Mudstone Formation\n(Rhaetian), but the new specimen comes from Blue Anchor, approximately 10 km\nwest along the coast from Lilstock. The more complete surangular would have\nbeen >2 m long, from an individual with a body length estimated at ~25 m. The\nidentification of two specimens with the same unique morphology and from the\nsame geologic age and geographic location warrants the erection of a new genus\nand species, Ichthyotitan severnensis gen. et sp. nov. Thin sections of the\nnew specimen revealed the same histological features already observed in\nsimilar giant ichthyosaurian specimens. Our data also supports the previous\nsuggestion of an atypical osteogenesis in the lower jaws of giant\nichthyosaurs. The geological age and giant size of the specimens suggest\nshastasaurid affinities, but the material is too incomplete for a definitive\nreferral. Ichthyotitan severnensis gen. et sp. nov., is the first-named giant\nichthyosaur from the Rhaetian and probably represents the largest marine\nreptile formally described.\n\n## Figures\n\nCitation: Lomax DR, de la Salle P, Perillo M, Reynolds J, Reynolds R, Waldron\nJF (2024) The last giants: New evidence for giant Late Triassic (Rhaetian)\nichthyosaurs from the UK.

The recent\ndiscovery of Cymbospondylus youngorum from the early Middle Triassic (Anisian,\n~245 Ma) of Nevada, USA, estimated to be around 15\u201317 m in length, shows that\nichthyosaurs reached giant body size as little as 3\u20135 million years after\ntheir first appearance [1, 2]. It was during the Late Triassic, however, when\nthe largest known ichthyosaurs emerged, belonging to the family\nShastasauridae. These include the Carnian (~230 Ma) Shonisaurus popularis (16\nm) [3, 4] and middle Norian (~215 Ma) Shonisaurus sikanniensis (21 m) [5]. The\nremains of giant ichthyosaurs from the Swiss Late Triassic have also been\ndescribed recently, including what is believed to be the largest ichthyosaur\ntooth yet discovered [6].\n\nIn 2018, Lomax et al. [7] reported on a large, isolated jaw fragment (an\nincomplete left surangular) from a giant ichthyosaur collected by PdlS in 2016\nfrom the latest Triassic (Rhaetian) in the UK, which provided a reassessment\nof the purported Aust \u2018dinosaurian\u2019 bones that were reinterpreted to belong to\nthe jaws of giant Rhaetian ichthyosaurs. As discussed in Lomax et al., body\nsize estimates (ranging from 22\u201330+ metres) based on these isolated bones\nsuggest that they probably represent the largest ichthyosaurs known to date,\nlarger even than S. sikanniensis.\n\nThis work reports the discovery of another large surangular from a giant\nTriassic (Rhaetian) ichthyosaur in the UK. The new specimen is a right\nsurangular that is morphologically identical but more complete than the left\nsurangular described by Lomax et al. [7]. A combination of unique\nmorphological characters observed in both examples suggest that they represent\na new taxon. Both specimens were discovered in Somerset, UK, and were\ncollected from strata dating to the latest Rhaetian, approximately 202 Ma [7,\n8]. The stratigraphic horizon present immediately above the level of both\nfinds represents a period of cataclysm with extensive seismite and tsunamite\nrocks [9, 10], indicative of the Late Triassic global mass extinction event.\nThis extinction greatly reduced both ecomorphological disparity and species\ndiversity and is considered the most poorly understood of the \u2018Big Five\u2019 mass\nextinctions [11\u201314]. It is probable that this lineage of giant ichthyosaurs\nvanished during the end-Triassic mass extinction event, and that ichthyosaurs\nnever reached this size again before their extinction in the early Late\nCretaceous (Cenomanian), around 94 Ma [15].\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nThe newly found specimen that is the focus of this study, BRSMG Cg3178 (herein\nreferred to as the BAS specimen, i.e. the Blue Anchor Surangular), is a large\nportion of an ichthyosaur surangular from the Westbury Mudstone Formation\n(latest Rhaetian), or Westbury Formation, collected at Blue Anchor, Somerset,\nUK (Figs 1\u20133; DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.25290661). A 3D photogrammetry model of\nthe specimen can be found here, DOI:\nhttps://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ichthyotitan-severnensis-\nsurangular-2d8556bc9cbd4cf1bd93b33044770a4f. BRSMG Cg2488, known as the\nLilstock surangular, is also from the Westbury Mudstone Formation (latest\nRhaetian), but was found at Lilstock, Somerset, UK (Figs 1 and 3; see\nsupplementary data from [7] DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.5975440). As described by\nLomax et al. [7], specimens BRSMG Cb3869, BRSMG Cb3870, and BRSMG Cb4063 are\nisolated, fragmentary bones from the jaws of giant ichthyosaurs collected from\nthe \u2018Rhaetic Bone Bed\u2019 at the base of the Westbury Mudstone Formation\n(Rhaetian) of Aust Cliff, Gloucestershire, UK; specifically, BRSMG Cb3869 is\nprobably a portion of a very large surangular. Comparisons are made with\nspecimens of Shonisaurus popularis (those discussed in [3] and also figured in\n[7]), the holotype of Shonisaurus sikanniensis (TMP 1994.378.02, [5]), and the\nholotype of Cymbospondylus youngorum (LACM DI 157871, [1]). For further\ncomparative purposes, we also examined MJML K2577, a comparable section of\nsurangular belonging to an example of Ophthalmosaurus icenicus from the Oxford\nClay Formation (163 Ma) of the upper Thames Valley, England. No permits were\nrequired for the described study, which complied with all relevant\nregulations. Whilst this manuscript was under review, the authors were made\naware of a recent discovery of another large, albeit much smaller fragment of\njaw from a giant ichthyosaur collected from Lilstock. The specimen is\npresently in a private collection, but it adds yet another example to the\ngrowing collection of giant Triassic ichthyosaurs in the UK. The specimen is\nnot discussed further.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 1.

The core was extracted from the most anterior\nfragment of the posterior section of the surangular, in the immediate\nposterior portion of the clearly visible furrow (nutrient foramen), to match\nthe sample area in BRSMG Cg2488 R-101 and BRSMG Cb3869 (see Fig 5). Two thin\nsections were produced from the core using wet silicon carbide powder of grit\nsizes 600 and 800 for grinding and polishing processes. Once covered, the thin\nsections were studied under a Leica DMLP light microscope with transmitted,\ncross-polarized light and circular polarized light. Circular polarized light\n[21] was obtained using a pair of commercially available 3D polarized lenses\nto replace the crossed polarizers. Photo-micrographs were obtained using a\nMounted Dino-Eye camera (software DinoCapture 2.0 ver 1.5.45 \u00a9 2016 AnMo\nElectronics Corporation). Photo-micrographs were merged using Image Composite\nEditor (ver. 2.0.3 \u00a92015 Microsoft).\n\nHistological terminology follows [22, 23] for general osteohistology. Networks\nof coarse collagenic fibres integrated in the periosteal bone matrix with no\nclear connection to external structures are defined as periosteal intrinsic\nfibres (PIF). PIF appear as a widespread structural character of the entire\nprimary bone matrix scaffold not connected to external structures. A\ncombination of PIF set in amorphous background matrix is defined as intrinsic\nfibre matrix (IFM). A woven-parallel complex with longitudinal osteons\nintegrating IFM as a woven matrix, is defined as periosteal intrinsic fibre\ntissue (PIFT). The concepts of PIF, IFM, PIFT, and the concept of \u2018template\u2019\nremodelling follow [18].\n\n### Nomenclatural acts\n\nThe electronic edition of this article conforms to the requirements of the\namended International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and hence the new names\ncontained herein are available under that Code from the electronic edition of\nthis article.

The first piece, representing a large, slightly worn bone\nsection was collected on May 28, 2020, by JR and RR who were fossil collecting\nat the Blue Anchor location (Fig 1). An anonymous member of the public had\nleft the bone on a large boulder at the top of the beach, presumably thinking\nthat it might be something of interest. JR and RR searched the vicinity of the\narea and RR found a better preserved, larger section clearly showing the\ndistinct Meckelian canal of an ichthyosaurian surangular. Together, both\nidentified the material as bone and compared the finds with the surangular\ndescribed by Lomax et al. [7]. As a result, they informed DRL and PdlS of the\ndiscovery. Several trips to the site led to the recovery of additional remains\nof BRSMG Cg3178, which were found by JR, RR, PdlS, DRL and others (see\nAcknowledgments).\n\nThe most recently collected piece of BRSMG Cg3178 was recovered by PdlS on\nOctober 16, 2022. Despite searching the foreshore and in situ location, no\nmore material has come to light, although there remains the strong possibility\nthat more of this individual is out there. As a result, the precise location\nof the BAS site is not being divulged at this stage due to the potential for\nmore material to be found.\n\nAdditional remains collected on the foreshore include eroded pieces of bone,\nalong with isolated rib fragments, vertebrae, and a phalanx all found loose on\nthe beach in the vicinity of the area where BRSMG Cg3178 was found. It is not\npossible to confidently associate any of the material with the surangular. Two\nlarge rib sections were also found embedded in a mass mortality bivalve\nmollusc bed which is stratigraphically just above where the rest of the\nsurangular pieces were found, which demonstrates these rib sections do not\ncome from the same individual but another potentially large-bodied\nichthyosaur. Additionally, a large coprolite containing fish scales was found\nin the vicinity. Unless stated otherwise, these additional elements are not\ndiscussed further.\n\nSimilar to the left surangular described by Lomax et al. [7], the BAS specimen\ncomes from the highest part of the Westbury Mudstone Formation (Upper\nTriassic, Rhaetian) and was found in twelve distinct pieces (Fig 2A). Like the\nLilstock surangular, the specimen shows signs of abrasion and encrusting\norganisms, including multiple bivalves (Atreta intrusstriata and Plagiostoma\ngiganteum, DRL pers. comm. Crispin Little 2023) and probable\nscavenging/scratch-like marks (see also [7] Fig 4; Fig 4). Considering the\nstratigraphical position of this specimen, as in the Lilstock surangular, it\nnarrowly predates the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event found in the above\nCotham Formation ([7, 24, 25]). Together, these specimens represent the latest\nTriassic occurrence of giant ichthyosaurs in the UK.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 4.

The referred\nspecimen was collected from the Upper Triassic Westbury Mudstone Formation\n(latest Rhaetian) 0.8 m below the junction with the Cotham Formation, at\nLilstock, Somerset, UK.\n\n#### Diagnosis.\n\nGiant, probable shastasaurid ichthyosaur distinguished by the presence of the\nfollowing unique characters of the surangular: upturned, almost 90 degree\nangle bend at posterior end; subcircular cross section morphology of the shaft\nat the position of the coronoid, oblong in Shonisaurus; minor eminence of\ncoronoid process in lateral view, compared with prominent projection in\nShonisaurus; bulbous coronoid process displaced laterally and only occupying\nhalf of the width of the dorsal surface; massively developed dorsoventral\nM.A.M.E. ridge; spatulate shaped posterior end; and possibly dorsoventral\nheight of posterior end in adults being more than 20% larger than in either\nShonisaurus popularis or Shonisaurus sikanniensis.\n\n#### Remarks.\n\nFurther to the last character in the diagnosis, this feature can be used to\ndistinguish the new taxon from other giant ichthyosaurs, as mentioned, but\nthis could be problematic for assigning immature or juvenile individuals of I.\nsevernensis that would be smaller than adult specimens of Shonisaurus spp.\nTherefore, we feel that this character can be used to compare large,\npresumably adult specimens but might not be useful (unless scaling is taken\ninto consideration) in assigning smaller individuals that may be discovered in\nthe future. Another notable feature that might be of interest is a continuous,\nstraight thin groove in the ventral surface of the BAS specimen. For further\ndetails, see the description below. Probable shastasaurid affinities are based\non the large size of the ichthyosaur combined with the Upper Triassic age, a\ntime when the largest-known ichthyosaurs (the Shastasauridae) existed.\n\n### Description and analysis\n\nThe holotype of Ichthyotitan severnensis (BRSMG Cg3178, BAS specimen) is a\nlarge, robust but incomplete right surangular, uncrushed and preserved in\nthree dimensions (Figs 2, 3A and 3C). The only referred material comprises the\nLilstock specimen (BRSMG Cg2488), which represents a near identical albeit\nless complete left surangular, preserved in three dimensions with a length of\n96 cm (Fig 3B and 3D). The BAS specimen was chosen as the holotype because it\nis more complete and is generally better preserved. The Lilstock surangular\nwas described in detail by Lomax et al. [7] and is, where appropriate,\ncompared here with the new specimen. Relatively few surangulars are known from\nthe largest Triassic ichthyosaurs and uncrushed three-dimensional preservation\nof isolated ones is rare. This is partly the reason why such bones have\npreviously been misidentified [7].\n\nThe holotype is separated into at least 12 distinct sections that are\nassociated and split into two main portions, termed Part #A and Part #B to aid\nwith description (Fig 2A). The best-preserved part of the surangular is the\nmiddle to posterior portion (Part #A), made up of five key segments, which is\napproximately 99 cm in length. A more anterior section (Part #B) of the\nsurangular was found scattered in five pieces on the foreshore and shows a\nmoderate amount of wear from erosion. This section measures 46 cm long. The\nconnecting material between these two sections of the surangular, along with\nthe anterior-most portion, have not been found. Two additional pieces of the\nanterior portion were collected but the position of only one of them could be\napproximately located on the surangular (see Fig 2A). We can be confident of\nthe association between the anterior and posterior portions due to them being\nfound in the immediate vicinity of each other, along with their size and their\nshared morphology. The combined preserved length of Part #A and Part #B\nmeasures 145 cm. Based on the extrapolation of measurements of the tapering\nthickness of the anterior portion, which indicates a potential minimum gap\nbetween the two main sections of 38 cm (Fig 2A), combined with the additional\npiece from the anterior region suggests a significant portion of the anterior\nis missing. We estimate the total length of the surangular to be >2 m (Fig\n2A).\n\nAs in the Lilstock specimen, the posterior end of the BAS surangular is thick\nand dorsoventrally tall with an almost 90-degree curve (Figs 2A and 3). Lomax\net al. [7] considered that the curvature might be the result of taphonomic\ndistortion in the Lilstock specimen, but the preservation in BAS is much\nbetter and confirms that the curvature is natural. Nevertheless, when compared\nside-by-side in medial view, the Lilstock surangular is clearly distorted at\nthe posterior-most end where the straightened edge of the dorsal surface is\nrotated posteriorly, a feature that is correctly oriented and in a natural\nposition in the BAS specimen (compare Fig 3C and 3D). As discussed in [7], a\nsimilar but less marked curvature occurs in the surangular of Shonisaurus\nsikanniensis and a slight curve is present in S. popularis. Lomax et al. [7]\nfurther noted that there might be some differences in the degree of curvature\namong taxa, stating that it is impossible to determine the significance with\nsuch a small sample size. However, we now have both the Lilstock and BAS\nspecimens with the same degree of dorsoventral curvature. Overall, the rear\nsection of the BAS surangular is remarkably similar in size and morphology to\nthe Lilstock specimen. The maximum dorsoventral height is at the posterior end\nof the surangular and is 26 cm, as preserved.\n\nA small, bulbous coronoid process with minor eminence is present and is\nlaterally directed and laterally displaced, making it difficult to observe in\nlateral view (Figs 2B, 2C, 3A and 3C); this morphology differs greatly from\nShonisarus popularis which has a prominent triangular coronoid process\n(compare Fig 2A with [7], Fig 7A). It only occupies half of the width of the\ndorsal surface in the coronoid region and the medial side shows a slight\nconcavity in this region (Fig 2C). Its surface is pitted with numerous\nforward-directed foramina and muscle scars. Note that due to distortion\npresent in the Lilstock specimen, the identification observed herein on the\nBAS specimen shows that the coronoid process was misidentified in Lomax et al.\n[7] leading to the incorrect placement of the M.A.M.E. (M. adductor mandibulae\nexternus) process in the Lilstock surangular (Fig 3). Slightly anterior to the\ncoronoid process, this part of the bone is subcircular in cross section,\nunlike in the surangular of Shonisarus popularis, which is distinctly oblong\nin cross section (see Fig 19 in [3]). As a result of the robustness at the\npoint of the coronoid process, this section of the surangular is wider than it\nis anteriorly (Fig 2D).\n\nThere is a minor reduction in the dorsoventral height immediately posterior to\nthe coronoid process. However, the height then greatly increases dorsally at\nthe point of the almost 90-degree curve, marked by the presence of a massive,\nprominent and extensive M.A.M.E. ridge on the medial side for muscle\nattachment (Fig 3). The ridge shows clear muscle attachment scars, as in the\nLilstock specimen. A thin process curves dorsally from a point posterior to\nthe M.A.M.E. at an angle of 90 degrees to the main shaft of the bone. This\nprocess carries prominent vertical ridges and furrows on its medial side (Figs\n2E, 2F, 3C and 3D), as reported in the Cuers ichthyosaur [26]. The purpose of\nthis feature is unknown.\n\nThe Meckelian canal is prominently visible along the medial side of both parts\n(Part #A and #B; Figs 2A, 3C) and would have provided a conduit for the\npassage of nerves and blood vessels (and cartilage during bone growth). It is\npartially filled with a light grey matrix and preserves bivalves in some\nplaces (Figs 2H and 4B). The distalmost part of the posterior end of the ramus\nnarrows laterally and expands dorsoventrally forming a large, spatula-shaped\nconcavity for the reception of the articular bone (not present). Towards the\nanterior-mid section of Part #A, there is evidence of a broken, overhanging\nshelf enclosing the Meckelian canal dorsally along most of its length, from\nthe anterior to the region of the coronoid process. In one area this is\ncomplete (Figs 2G, 2H and 3C) and is likely for the reception of the dentary.\nIn the posterior region, the Meckelian canal opens up posteriorly into a large\nfossa pierced by a number of foramina, the largest of which connects through\nthe bone to the fossa surangularis on the lateral side (Fig 3). The fossa\nsurangularis opens into a number of forward-directed, elongated foramina on\nthe lateral side of the rear section of the bone and into a continuous fossa\nalong the lateral side of the anterior section (Figs 2A and 3A); this fossa is\nvisible in the bone cross sections. It is also observed in the Lilstock\nspecimen and another large section of probable surangular (BRSMG Cb3869),\nwhere those bones also bear multiple, fine longitudinal indentations,\npreserved across the lateral and dorsal surfaces.\n\nAs described above, the posterior part of the surangular (Part #A) is the\nbetter preserved of the two main portions, showing little erosion or\ndistortion. However, the anterior part of the surangular (Part #B) is more\ncomplex in cross-sectional outline than the posterior, showing complex concave\nfacets on both the medial and lateral surfaces. Presumably, these are for the\nreception of the dentary on the lateral side, and the splenial on the medial\nside. The large lateral groove on this anterior portion probably represents\nthe fossa surangularis in this region. This feature is also seen in the Cuers\nichthyosaur ([26] Fig 2), a large incomplete surangular [see 7].\n\nA damaged portion of bone is present ventral to the Meckelian canal, best\nviewed along the lower medial side (see e.g. Fig 2H). Through direct\ncomparison with the holotype of the Early Triassic Cymbospondylus youngorum\n(DRL and JFW pers. obs.), for which a well-preserved and articulated skull\nexists, the position of the bone suggests that it is probably part of the\nangular. It is present along the entire length of the surangular and can be\nseen on both the anterior and posterior sections, although best preserved on\nthe posterior part (Part #A). There is a distinct, continuous, and straight\nthin groove (a probable suture) visible between the two bones at the surface.\nHowever, a close examination of the internal bone structure, visible in cross\nsection, shows that it is continuous across the bone junction, with no\ndiscontinuity in cell structure and no intervening matrix. This may indicate\nthat the bones were possibly fused together in life with no fossa separating\nthem. If so, this would be unusual and possibly unique among ichthyosaurs,\nperhaps related to the large size and presumed mature nature of the\nindividual. On a section of bone just anterior to the coronoid process, a\nvestigial suture between the surangular and (?)angular can be seen to\ndisappear completely, further confirming the apparent fusion. A similar\nmorphology is present in at least one of the Aust bones (BRSMG Cb3869), as\nalso alluded to by Huene [27]. The Lilstock surangular is poorly preserved in\nventral view, but direct observations suggest that there might also be a faint\ngroove.\n\n### Results of core sampling\n\nThe section taken from BRSMG Cg3178, the BAS specimen (Fig 5A and 5B middle),\nshows good preservation, although multiple osteons showing irregular breakage\nrims without clear Howship\u2019s lacunae, and a long diagonal fracture in its\nlower half (Figs 5B and 6A) indicate diagenetic or taphonomic-related damage.\nThe bone histology is characterized by a highly vascularized woven-parallel\ncomplex [22, 23] (Figs 5B, 6A and 6B). Vascular canals are strictly\nlongitudinally oriented (Figs 5B and 6A). The primary bone matrix is\ncharacterized by a complex of networks of intrinsic longitudinal mineralized\ncollagen fibres (periosteal intrinsic fibres, or PIF [18]) (Fig 6D, 6E and\n6G). Under cross-polarized light, PIF appear bright against an isotropic\namorphous dark background matrix (Fig 6D). PIF appear as circular or spirally\ncoiled structures under circularly polarized view (Fig 6D, 6E and 6G). The\nnetwork of PIF set in an amorphous dark matrix (Fig 6D) defines an intrinsic\nfibre matrix, IFM, [18] (and see Materials and methods). IFM is identifiable\nboth in the trabeculae interstitial bone (Fig 6G) and, as primary matrix of\nthe rest of the cortex (Fig 6D and 6E). The section can be subdivided into an\ninnermost half of spongious trabecular bone (trabecular region), and a compact\ncortex that can be further subdivided for description purposes, into a deep\ncortex and an outer cortex (Fig 5B).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 5.\n\nA.

The presence of primary matrix and concentric secondary osteons indicate\nthat the trabeculae are secondary, produced from compact bone made cancellous.\nWhite arrows (D, E, G) point at PIF; white arrowheads point at resorption\nlines in concentric osteons (C, F, G); white dotted lines indicate borders of\nprimary osteons (C, F, G); yellow arrow heads (B, D) point at rows of GMs.\nAbbreviations. LB, Lamellar bone; NC, Nutrient canal; OC, Open periosteal\ncanal; PO, Primary osteon; RC, Resorption cavity; SC, Simple canal; SO,\nSecondary osteon.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0300289.g006\n\nThe trabecular region presents secondary trabeculae constituted by compact\nbone made cancellous (sensu [22]) (Figs 5B, 6A and 6G). The trabeculae are\ncomposed by islands of IFM bordered by large resorption cavities (RC) and\nhemiosteons (Fig 6A and 6G). RC and hemiosteons are lined by relatively few\nlayers of lamellar bone (Fig 6G). It is possible to observe a preferential\norientation of the trabecular bone in the horizontal plane (Figs 5B and 6A).\n\nPassing from the trabecular region to the deep cortex, the size of the RC\ngradually diminishes (Figs 5B and 6A), giving space to a highly vascularized,\nwell-arranged compact bone showing large numbers of secondary osteons that\ngenerally appear in an in-row arrangement (Fig 6A). The in-row arrangement\nappears parallel or slightly subparallel to the subperiosteal outer surface.\nThe primary tissue constituting the compact cortex is periosteal intrinsic\nfibre tissue (PIFT) observed by Perillo and Sander [18].\n\nA close inspection following the methods described in [16, 18] shows that\nsecondary osteons present successive resorption lines inside the osteon\nlamellar infill (Fig 6C and 6F). This phenomenon results from a consistent\nspatial correspondence between basal metabolic unit development and previously\nexisting vascular canals. Secondary osteons develop preferentially inside\npreexisting osteons, either primary or secondary (in the latter case these are\nnamed concentric osteons). This phenomenon defines a \u2018template\u2019 remodelling\n[18]. It is nonetheless possible to see many resorption cavities in the deep\ncortex, although some of this may be related to preparation damages due to\ntheir shape. The number of resorption cavities present in the deep cortex\nincreases the overall porosity of the bone structure (Figs 5B and 6A) and\nsuggests an advanced resorption front [28].\n\nIn the deep cortex, going toward the subperiosteal surface, the number of\nprimary osteons, immature secondary osteons and concentric secondary osteons\nincreases, while the amount of resorption cavities and non-concentric osteons\ndecreases. Compared to the cancellous bone, the compact cortex shows also an\nincreased amount of PIF clearly visible (Fig 6B and 6E). In the upper deep\ncortex and outer cortex, it is possible to identify numerous (~15) closely\npositioned wavey GMs formed by the alternation of brighter and darker layers\nof PIF (Fig 6B and 6D). The width and colour of the GMs is variable with\ndarker and brighter ones alternating with no clear pattern. These GMs embrace\nthe primary osteon and vascular canals and originate from periosteal\napposition but do not show changes in tissue type, being always composed of\nIFM. Given the absence of a change of tissue type, these GMs are not\nidentifiable as LAGs (see Discussion). By close inspection, a scarce number of\nsimilar GMs, are identifiable in the rest of the deep cortex, always embracing\nthe parallel rows of osteons but showing less continuity due to the higher\nnumber of RC.\n\nA large longitudinal resorption cavity (diameter around 0.75 mm, area around 2\nmm^2) occupies the upper central area of the section in the deep cortex (Figs\n5B and 6A), and is identifiable as a nutrient canal. The rim of the canals\nshows primary IFM (Fig 6E), primary osteons and simple canals, as well as\nHowship\u2019s lacunae, indicating that this area was actively subjected to\nosteogenic and osteoclastic processes through the developmental stages of the\nanimal. The large nutrient canal is connected to the outer surface by a large\ndiagonal canal (Fig 6A and 6B). The section of the canal lumen measuring 0.3\nmm in diameter (but tapering to 0.15 mm in its middle, assuming an hourglass\nshape). The diagonal canal is detectable by the darker colour of its lumen\nwall compared to the surrounding bone (Fig 6A and 6B). The borders of the\ndiagonal canal show a clear continuity with the surrounding periosteal rims of\nthe outer cortex as suggested by the organization of osteons and GMs (Fig 6B).\nThe lumen wall of the diagonal canal shows longitudinal simple canals and\nsecondary osteons orderly arranged parallel to its diagonal orientation (Fig\n6B). Both under cross polarized view and circularly polarized view the canal\nlumen wall shows the presence of PIF (Fig 6B and 6D), indicating it is made of\nIFM.\n\nIn correspondence with the border of the large nutrient canal, the GMs show a\nclear descending down turning (Fig 6B). This skewed arrangement indicates that\nthe periosteal apposition process was influenced by the presence of the major\nnerve and/or blood vessel occupying the nutrient canal.\n\nThe outer cortex shows simple canals, primary osteons and incipient concentric\nsecondary osteons (Fig 6B and 6D). It is not possible to identify an External\nFundamental System. The subperiosteal surface is characterized by various open\nperiosteal canals (Figs 5B, 6A and 6B). The latter show rims with no signs of\nbreakage, therefore are identifiable as genuine biological open canals. The\noccurrence of open periosteal canals and simple canals indicates active growth\nat the time of death, as for some of the Aust bones described by [16]; see\nalso [7]. The borders of the nutrient canal show primary bone tissue with\nsimple vascular canals and primary osteons, resembling the condition observed\non the outer cortex (Fig 5B, 5D and 5E). Numerous osteocyte lacunae are\nevident in the entirety of the section: dynamic flattened osteocytes are\ncommonly found in lamellar bone (Fig 5C, 5E and 5G), while plump or irregular\nshaped ones are found both in the PIFT matrix and in its lamellar bone (Fig 5F\nand 5C).\n\n### A note on size estimations\n\nWhen describing the Lilstock surangular, Lomax et al. [7] used large\nshastasaurid ichthyosaurs to provide a rough total length estimate of the\nichthyosaur and for one of the Aust bones (BRSMG Cb3869), but emphasised the\nneed for caution with such estimates when dealing with isolated remains. To\ndetermine these size estimates, using a simple scaling factor, they compared\n(1) the maximum dorsoventral height at the posterior end of the Lilstock\nsurangular with the same point in the surangular of the large Shonisaurus\nsikanniensis and (2) the height of the Lilstock surangular at the coronoid\nprocess compared with the same in a smaller shastasaurid, Besanosaurus\nleptorhynchus [29]. Based on these comparisons, Lomax et al. [7] found that\nthe Lilstock ichthyosaur had an estimated total length of between 26 and 22 m\nrespectively and further stated that it is reasonable to suggest that the\nLilstock ichthyosaur was on the order of 20\u201325 m long.\n\nHowever, being better preserved than the Lilstock specimen, the BAS surangular\nhas revealed that the identification of the position of the coronoid process\nand M.A.M.E. process on the Lilstock surangular are incorrect (see Fig 3) and\ntherefore the size estimate compared with B. leptorhynchus is inaccurate. The\nposition used by [7] for the measurement of the coronoid process (2) in the\nLilstock surangular is actually the position of the M.A.M.E. Therefore, we use\nthe position of the dorsoventral height of the M.A.M.E. in BAS, which measures\n19 cm, and is the same height as that previously identified as the coronoid\n(now M.A.M.E.) in Lilstock, compared with the same point in B. leptorhynchus\nthat measures approximately 3.5\u20134 cm at the M.A.M.E. (based on the\nillustration by Bindellini et al., [30], Fig 4; see also [7]). Note, however,\nthat [30] follow a different terminology and refer to the M.A.M.E. in B.\nleptorhynchus as the coronoid process, but we regard their coronoid process as\nthe M.A.M.E.; nevertheless, the measurement and scaling remains the same\nregardless of the identification. Based on this revised comparison, it\nsuggests that the Lilstock/BAS ichthyosaurs are almost five times larger than\nBesanosaurus (which has a total body length of 5.4 m) with the largest total\nlength estimate of 25 m, thus still in the 20\u201325 m range given by Lomax et al.\n[7].\n\nTo test the simple scaling further, we also compared the BAS specimen with a\nposterior section of surangular from an example of the common Upper Jurassic\nophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur, Ophthalmosaurus icenicus (MJML K2577; Fig 7).\nThis specimen was chosen due to the same portion of surangular being three-\ndimensionally preserved and the fact that the M.A.M.E. and coronoid processes\ncan easily be identified and compared between both specimens (see Fig 7). As a\nresult, we could provide a new scaling comparison. This time, by comparing the\ndistance between the M.A.M.E. and coronoid processes in the Ophthalmosaurus\nspecimen (measuring 4 cm) and the same in BAS (measuring 20 cm), this suggests\nan individual with an estimated body length five times greater, at 25 m long,\nthe same estimate as presented above.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 7.

BRSMG Cg2488 and MJML K2577 are positioned obliquely\nin lateral view (with MJML K2577 rotated and held closer to the camera),\nillustrating the general shape of the ichthyosaurian surangular.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0300289.g007\n\nIt is also worth reiterating the point made by Lomax et al. [7] that if the\nAust specimen BRSMG Cb3869 is part of a surangular, which appears correct (see\nFig 5A), then by using the same simple scaling this individual would be\nestimated at a very speculative 30+ m. Based on the analysis of the BRSMG\nCb3869 bone microstructure [16, 18], this section is from an animal that was\nstill growing at the time of death [16, 18] and might be due to prolonged\ngrowth strategies as previously suggested (see Discussion in [7]).\n\n## Discussion\n\nConfidently assigning isolated, fragmentary, or poorly preserved remains to a\nspecific taxon is challenging and can be problematic when key features are\nlacking, or insufficient material is preserved. When describing the Lilstock\nsurangular, Lomax et al. [7] considered that the specimen might have possible\nshastasaurid affinities based on its geologic age and giant size. They further\nshowed that it had an unusual morphology that appeared unique but refrained\nfrom assigning a specific name to the specimen due to its incompleteness,\ntaphonomic distortion and the fact that it was represented by an isolated\nbone. Moreover, surangulars from the largest Triassic ichthyosaurs are poorly\nknown and any three-dimensional specimens are rare, therefore making direct\ncomparisons difficult. However, those specimens that could be compared were\nfound to differ from the Lilstock specimen [7].\n\nThe discovery of yet another surangular (BRSMG Cg3178) possessing the same\nmorphology as the Lilstock specimen, but which is much better preserved and\nmore complete, provides additional support for the identification of something\nunique. Moreover, it illustrates that the Lilstock specimen was not simply a\nsingle bone with an unusual morphology. Although we appreciate that this new\ntaxon is based on two large incomplete surangulars, we feel that having two\nidentical bones showing the same unique morphology, and which were collected\nfrom the same geological formation separated by ~10 km, is enough to warrant\nthe erection of a new taxon. Furthermore, these specimens are approximately\n202 million years old, from the late Rhaetian, and appear roughly 13 million\nyears after the stratigraphically latest giant Triassic ichthyosaurs with a\nname, Shonisaurus sikanniensis from British Columbia, Canada [5], and\nHimalayasaurus tibetensis from Tibet, China [31]. Thus, given the differences\nin surangular morphology compared with Shonisaurus (e.g. compare the\nsurangular morphology with S. popularis figured in [7], Fig 7a) along with the\nstratigraphic and geographic separation, it is highly unlikely that\nIchthyotitan severnensis is an example of Shonisaurus or Himalayasaurus, which\nwould also suggest an extremely long stratigraphic record and a much wider\npalaeogeographical distribution than what is known for both genera. Having two\nexamples of the same bone with the same unique features from the same\nstratigraphic time zone supports the erection of a new taxon.\n\nConsidering the Rhaetian age and similar morphology of the bones, an argument\ncould perhaps be made for the Aust bones (at least BRSMG Cb3869) and the Cuers\nichthyosaur, a large surangular from the Rhaetian of France [26]; identified\nas a surangular by [7], to represent additional examples of I. severnensis.\nHowever, given that the Aust bones are stratigraphically slightly older (see\n[7], Fig 3), are much less complete and therefore do not show all the\ndiagnostic features found in both the Lilstock and BAS specimens, we do not\nassign them to this species in this study. Similarly, although the Cuers\nichthyosaur is more complete and shows some similarities with both specimens\n(see [26], Fig 2), the posterior end is somewhat poorly preserved and does not\nshow the defining features necessary for positive identification. Nonetheless,\nthese findings demonstrate that giant Rhaetian ichthyosaurs were present in\nthe Tethys during this time. Similarly, it is worth noting that a fragmentary\nichthyosaur comprising 17 ribs and two vertebral centra was recently\ndiscovered in the Gabbs Valley Range of Nevada, USA. Although this specimen\nhas yet to be formally described, it demonstrates that giant ichthyosaurs were\nalso present in Panthalassa during the Rhaetian [32].\n\nBased on the core sampling results, the thin sections confirm that the BAS\nspecimen shares peculiar histological characters with sections produced by\nother giant ichthyosaur specimens 16\u201318]. The same unique histology of the\nbones is supported by the presence of: 1) PIFT, 2) GMs determined by different\narrangement e/o density of layers of PIF, 3) strictly longitudinal\nvascularization, 4) concentric osteons determining a cortical \u2018template\nremodelling\u2019. Thus, the results of this study are in agreement with the\nconclusions reached previously [16\u201318]. Furthermore, even in its absence, we\npredict that longitudinal sections of this specimen would most likely show the\nsame structural collagen fibres arranged in a herringbone pattern, as observed\nin other giant ichthyosaurs [17, 18]. The presence of a nutrient foramen in\nthe BAS specimen, as with similar structures observed in both BRSMG Cg2488\nR-101 and BRSMG Cb3869, further supports the anatomical homology hypothesized\nfor these specimens [7, 17,18]. Finally, it is noticeable that the\nhorizontally oriented trabeculae, and the ratio of trabecular bone to compact\ncortex are also reminiscent of what was observed in BRSMG-Cb-3870 [16\u201318].\nAlthough the consequences of matching histology paired with similar morphology\nof these specimens are intriguing, the lack of a more refined taxonomic\nresolution of the fragmentary material prevents support to any stable\nconclusion regarding the phylogenetic attribution to Ichthyotitan.\n\nIn the context of understanding the growth patterns and the developmental\nstage of BRSMG Cg3178, it is relevant to discuss the nature of the GMs we\nobserved. The closely spaced GMs are, at first glance, reminiscent of LAGs\nforming the external fundamental system (EFS), which would advocate for an\nadult state of the animal and for the reaching of a stoppage in growth (i.e.\n[33]). Due to the same similarity, the identification of LAGs and the\noccurrence of an EFS was proposed by Redelstorff et al. [16] for another\nsimilar specimen (BRSMG-Cb-3870). It is noticeable, however, that the same\nstudy highlighted the thick width of BRSMG-Cb-3870 EFS as unusual and offered\nan alternative hypothesis to their conclusions. The GMs described here are\ncharacterized by a combination of higher brightness, lower brightness, and\ncolour change of the same primary bone (IFM) and show no clear tissue type\nchange (no lamellar bone or parallel fibered bone). This sharply contrasts\nwith what defines LAGs [22], as already supported by [18], which described the\nsame GMs from the specimens studied therein. The GMs described here are\nstructures derived by modulations of orientation and density of longitudinal\ncoarse fibres (PIF) deposited by active periosteal apposition [18] but with no\nclear connection to slowdown in growth. The identification of GMs as simple\nmarks derived by changes in density and orientation of coarse longitudinal\nfibres is not unheard of, although it was observed in metaplastic tissue [34,\nFig 2e and 2f]. To conclude, we do not observe an EFS given the absence in the\noutermost cortex of few layers of tightly packed LAGs. The absence of an EFS\nsupports that the animal had yet to reach an asymptotic growth stage. The\noccurrence of the GMs already in the upper deep cortex, with no appreciable\ntrend toward a diminishing space within them in the outer cortex, can be used\nas a further argument to exclude an ongoing progressive reduction in growth\nrate.\n\nFurther support for ongoing growth is offered by outer cortex vascularization.\nIn both BRSMG-Cb-3870 [16, 18] and our specimen, as well as in BRSMG Cg2488\nR-101 [18] and BRSMG Cb3869 [16, 18], the occurrence of multiple open\nperiosteal canals and high vascularization in the outer cortex indicate that\ngrowth by periosteal apposition was not ceased at the moment of death. The few\nhistological analysis carried on ichthyosaur rostra found them to be more\ncompact than postcranial material [35]. We can therefore support that the high\nvascularization is a genuine indicator of active growth rather than being\nrelated to an increased osteoporotic specialization of the lower jaw. The sign\nof primary bone apposition and osteoclast activity around the large nutrient\ncanal would indicate an ongoing reshaping of the nutrient canal overtime,\nthrough the development of the animal.\n\nThe absence of more complete and articulated remains prevents us to frame this\nspecimen in a developmental series. Nonetheless, the histological features of\nthe specimen here described (presence of primary bone, high superficial\ncortical vascularization, absence of EFS and a non-completely remodelled\ncortex) indicate a still growing subadult or an early adult. Lomax et al. [7]\nmentioned that processes like heterochronic sustained growth rates may have\nenabled the Late Triassic ichthyosaurs to reach giant sizes (~25+ m). However,\nmore comparative histological data (e.g. juvenile specimens of Ichthyotitan\nand more histological samples of Triassic ichthyosaurs) is needed to identify\nsuch developmental strategies in Ichthyotitan.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nA large ichthyosaur surangular was collected in 2016 from the UK Upper\nTriassic and was formally described by Lomax et al. [7] who also reinterpreted\nthe Aust \u2018dinosaurian\u2019 bone shafts as belonging to the jaws of giant Triassic\nichthyosaurs, something which had also been noted by Huene [27]. Recent\nsupport for these assertions was presented by Perillo et al. [17] who further\nassessed these claims by analysing the bone histology of the Lilstock specimen\nand the Aust bones. As such, they tested the \u201cHuene-Lomax hypothesis\u201d\nhistologically and found that the histology of these bones supports an\nichthyosaurian affinity (see also the \u201cGiant Ichthyosaur hypothesis\u201d in [18]).\n\nThe discovery of another giant ichthyosaur surangular from the Somerset coast\nof the UK provides additional support for the conclusions presented by [7] and\nthe findings of [17, 18]. The new specimen matches the Lilstock surangular in\noverall shape, bears the same unique morphology and comes from the same\nstratigraphic age (Westbury Mudstone Formation, Upper Triassic, latest\nRhaetian). The specimen is, however, more complete and better preserved than\nthe Lilstock surangular and includes a large portion of the anterior section,\nshowing distinct facets for the dentary and a section of what is possibly the\nangular, which appears fused to the surangular. We herein formally assign\nthese two specimens to a new genus and species, Ichthyotitan severnensis,\nwhich is the first-named giant ichthyosaur from the Rhaetian. This taxon has\nan estimated body length of around 25 m, or at least somewhere in the 20\u201326 m\nrange and represents the largest estimate for a prehistoric marine reptile.\nThe histological analysis agrees with similar specimens and advocates for a\nstill growing sub-adult or early adult animal that had yet to reach an\nasymptotic growth stage. It is, however, worth reiterating that this is based\non fragmentary remains and thus more complete specimens are required to\nconfirm the giant size. Furthermore, if the estimates for the Aust bones are\ncorrect, as per Lomax et al. [7], then those individuals probably represent\nthe largest ichthyosaurs known.\n\nAs summarized by Lomax et al. [7], these giant fragmentary jaw bones may\neasily be missed or could be mistaken for the remains of dinosaurs because of\ntheir size. The authors hoped that the description and identification of the\nLilstock specimen would lead to more discoveries, which ultimately led to the\nidentification of the BAS specimen described herein. It is our hope that more\ncomplete remains of this enigmatic giant ichthyosaur will be discovered in\ntime. If any additional material is found, we kindly encourage the finders to\ncontact the authors.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank Prof Judy Massare for discussions around the newly collected\nspecimen.
