The\nTransportation Security Administration saw its busiest summer ever. All-time,\nsingle-day passenger traffic records fell on two occasions. Airlines fielded\nhistoric demand for overseas travel, prompting carriers to shift their\nschedules to meet an enduring craving for travel.\n\nBy all accounts, 2024 will be more of the same.\n\nBut it remains a very different story at many of America's smallest airports.\n\nNearly four years after the pandemic shuttered air travel and helped\nprecipitate a pilot shortage that had been brewing for years, travelers in\nmany rural and midsize communities have far fewer flight options than they did\nbefore March 2020.\n\nWant more airline-specific news? Sign up for TPG's free biweekly Aviation\nnewsletter.\n\nTake Williamsport, Pennsylvania, as an example: To get to the nearest major\nhub, you have to drive three hours to Philadelphia.\n\nBefore the pandemic, there was no need for the trek. You could just fly out of\nWilliamsport Regional Airport (IPT).\n\nSure, you'd have to make a connection at Philadelphia International Airport\n(PHL), but with that one stop, you could easily be on your way to the West\nCoast, Europe or elsewhere.\n\nBut those days are long gone. Today, no major carrier flies out of IPT ... and\nit's been that way there \u2014 and at far too many other airports across the\ncountry \u2014 for a few years now.\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive\ndeals from TPG\u2019s experts\n\n## Dwindling service at smaller airports\n\nAfter some back-and-forth at the height of the pandemic, American Airlines \u2014\nthen Williamsport's only major airline \u2014 decided in 2020 to drop service at\nIPT for good, citing pandemic-era head winds.\n\nThat left the airport with no commercial service.\n\nWilliamsport Regional Airport (IPT). HEATHER AINSWORTH/WASHINGTON POST/GETTY\nIMAGES\n\n\"It was a long two years trying to figure out what we could do next,\" Richard\nHowell, IPT's executive director, acknowledged in a recent interview with TPG.\n\nHowell ran into dead ends as he tried to lure an airline back to the city. A\nkey challenge: Others were trying to do the same.\n\nSince 2020, airlines have exited at least 121 markets nationwide, according to\nthe Regional Airline Association, which advocates for regional carriers \u2014\nincluding smaller airlines like SkyWest Airlines, PSA Airlines, Republic\nAirways and Horizon Air \u2014 that feed into larger network carriers and fly\nbetween big hubs and smaller communities under names like American Eagle,\nDelta Connection and United Express.\n\nAn American Eagle regional jet operated by PSA Airlines at Philadelphia\nInternational Airport (PHL). SEAN CUDAHY/THE POINTS GUY\n\n### Pilot shortage\n\nAs TPG has reported for two years, regional carriers were hit especially hard\nby the nationwide pilot shortage. When travel ramped back up after the down\ndays of the pandemic, the big \"mainline\" airlines went on hiring sprees,\nreplenishing their ranks after offering pilots buyouts and early retirements\nin 2020.\n\nWhen they hired, they often hired away from the regional carriers, where many\npilots begin their careers.\n\nOn top of that siphoning off the regional airlines' staff, the larger carriers\nare increasingly using fewer \u2014 but larger \u2014 planes to transport more\npassengers. That's made the landscape even more of an uphill climb for\ncommunities like Williamsport, which is capable of filling a small aircraft\nbut likely not a larger one.\n\n\"For a small market like ours that's ideally suited for a 50-seat jet, that\nwas really problematic,\" Howell said.\n\n### Service cuts have mounted\n\nThe results are troubling.\n\nNationwide, a dozen airports have lost all commercial service in recent years,\naccording to the RAA. Thirty-seven airports have lost at least half. Many more\nstill have service but have seen their number of flights drop significantly.\n\nThrough the first six months of 2024, Ithaca Tompkins International Airport\n(ITH) in New York will see airlines offer 34% fewer seats than that same\nperiod in 2019, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium. That's\ndespite the airport's having undergone a $34.8 million renovation that wrapped\nup in 2019, which more than doubled the size of the terminal and saw the\nairport go from one jet bridge to four.\n\nROBERT A STANTON, STREETER ASSOCIATES/ITHACA THOMPKINS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\n\nIt's not just ultrarural communities, either.\n\nDuring the first half of this year, seats from Eugene F. Kranz Toledo Express\nAirport (TOL) in Ohio are down 51% from 2019. They're down 64% at Joplin\nRegional Airport (JLN) in southwest Missouri; down by 31% at Fayetteville\nRegional Airport (FAY) in North Carolina, near Fort Liberty (formerly Fort\nBragg); and down by 36% at Dayton International Airport (DAY) in Ohio, which\nis near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base \u2014 not to mention the former home of\nthe Wright brothers.\n\n\"Dozens of airports continue to have less than half the flights they had\nbefore the pandemic. And a quarter of the country is still missing, on\naverage, 1 in 4 flights,\" RAA CEO Faye Malarkey Black told TPG, noting that\nsome 400 regional jets nationwide are parked. The ones that aren't parked are\nunderused.\n\n### Examples of airports that have lost significant service\n\nAirport| % of departing seats lost (first 6 months of 2024 vs. 2019)  \n---|---  \nDel Rio International Airport (DRT), Texas| -100%  \nEasterwood Airport (CLL); College Station, Texas| -34%  \nEvansville Regional Airport (EVV), Indiana| -27%  \nLa Crosse Regional Airport (LSE), Wisconsin| -57%  \nLansing Airport (LAN), Michigan| \\- 30%  \nLincoln Airport (LNK), Nebraska| -33%  \nManchester-Boston Regional Airport (MHT), New Hampshire| -31%  \nMeridian Regional Airport (MEI), Mississippi| -45%  \nSioux Gateway Airport (SUX); Sioux City, Iowa| -43%  \nCentral Wisconsin Airport (CWA); Wausau, Wisconsin| -30%  \n  \nData sourced from Cirium Diio\n\n## A challenge for travelers and communities\n\nIt takes a toll.\n\nWilliamsport, widely known as the host city for the Little League World Series\neach summer, is also the headquarters for numerous businesses.\n\nThe Little League World Series Complex in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. JOSHUA\nBESSEX/GETTY IMAGES\n\nAs time has passed, Howell has started to hear concerns from local leaders.\n\n\"Rumblings that we're starting to have potential issues with recruitment to\nbring new businesses into the area,\" he said.\n\nIt's not just Williamsport.\n\nThat frustration is apparent in Dubuque, Iowa, too, where American Airlines\noffered 2,100 flights in 2019, per Cirium \u2014 an average of five daily\ndepartures.\n\nBut just weeks after the airport flooded with fans headed to another iconic\nbaseball spectacle in 2022 \u2014 professional games at the \"Field of Dreams\" site\nnear Dyersville, Iowa \u2014 Dubuque Regional Airport (DBQ) saw its only commercial\nservice come to an end.\n\nDubuque, Iowa. JOHN ELK/THE IMAGE BANK/GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe airport has since welcomed upstart budget carrier Avelo Airlines, but it's\nnot the same. The airline flies twice weekly to Orlando, though it just paused\nits service until November as part of a seasonal cycle.\n\nClearly, there's still a void, said Todd Dalsing, the airport's director.\n\n\"We're hoping we can eventually pick up \u2014 even if it's not seven days a week \u2014\nmaybe it's Monday to Friday, starting with one flight a day,\" Dalsing said.\n\"To get us back into the system, and be able to show the support of our\ncommunity.\"\n\n### US states with highest rate of air service lost\n\nRank| State| % of departures lost (January 2020 vs. January 2024)  \n---|---|---  \n1.| Vermont| \\- 33%  \n2.| New Hampshire| -29%  \n3.| Iowa| -28%  \n4.| Michigan| -28%  \n5.| Pennsylvania| -27%  \n6.| Maine| -26%  \n7.| Wisconsin| -24%  \n8.| Oregon| -24%  \n9.| North Dakota| -23%  \n10.| Ohio| -23%  \n  \nData sourced from the Regional Airline Association\n\n## Reasons for optimism? Maybe\n\nThere are at least some reasons to be optimistic.\n\nDown the road from Williamsport, Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport\n(AVP), another hard-hit airport, has seen its seats in the first half of this\nyear increase by 20% versus last year, per Cirium, thanks in large part to the\narrival of another startup low-cost carrier, Breeze Airways \u2014 though seats\nfrom the airport will still be roughly a third short of 2019 levels.\n\nIn January, Williamsport itself secured flights to Dulles International\nAirport (IAD) near Washington, D.C., aboard commuter carrier Southern Airways\nExpress. The twice-daily service begins next month. Still, it's an imperfect\nreplacement for the seamless connections American Airlines once offered via\nits Philadelphia hub.\n\nHEATHER AINSWORTH/WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES\n\nAvelo, in particular, has brought new life to other airports that didn't have\ncommercial service previously, such as in Wilmington, Delaware; New Haven,\nConnecticut; and Lakeland, Florida.\n\n### Regional service a stronger focus?\n\nThe larger airlines have also signaled interest in restoring service to\nsmaller communities.\n\nAt an industry conference last fall, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom noted\nthat the carrier's growth plans in 2024 largely centered on getting regional\naircraft back into the air.\n\n\"As I take a look out into 2024, there's good news for a lot of regional\ncommunities that saw massive reductions in terms of capacity,\" Isom said\nduring a panel moderated by aviation journalist and current TPG contributor\nEdward Russell.\n\n\"It's Roanoke [in Virginia] and Lubbock [in Texas] and a lot of small cities \u2014\n[Michigan's] Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids,\" Isom said. \"It's going to be a lot of\nsmall cities throughout the United States.\"\n\nDelta Air Lines executives have likewise noted the carrier's hope to bring\nregional jets back into the mix as part of a larger effort to rebuild capacity\nacross parts of its network that haven't fully recovered since the start of\nthe pandemic.\n\n\"The final stage of our core hub restoration will be the full return of\nregional flying,\" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on the company's most\nrecent earnings call April 10. \"We still have probably at least 50 regionals\neither not flying, or underutilized \u2014 probably almost 100 when you include the\nunderutilization.\"\n\nA Delta Connection Embraer 175 operated by Republic Airways. NICOLAS\nECONOMOU/NUR PHOTO/GETTY IMAGES\n\nYet, Black of the RAA believes any signs of progress are modest at best, with\nthe number of pilots in the pipeline still not sufficient to fully overcome\nthe service cuts of recent years \u2014 and a wave of pilot retirements expected\nlater in the 2020s.\n\n\"We are not seeing communities fall off the map in vast numbers like we did in\n2022 and 2023. But we aren't seeing recovery at any scale,\" Black said. \"Air\nservice remains in crisis.\"\n\n## Small, local airports still popular\n\nThat's not to say Americans have lost interest in small airports.\n\nA majority of Dubuque citizens would support air service if it came back,\nDalsing said, citing preliminary survey data from the local chamber of\ncommerce.\n\nAfter all, the same factors that made these airports convenient before the\npandemic still exist today.\n\n\"Being 10 minutes from your home ... short wait times, very short TSA line,\nfriendly, accommodating staff ... that definitely played a role,\" Dalsing\nsaid.\n\nFree parking doesn't hurt, either, in Dubuque's case.\n\nMore plainly, there's obvious appeal in departing from an airport just down\nthe street.\n\nBut across the country, it's an option far fewer travelers have today than\nthey did five years ago \u2014 and it's not clear when that might change.\n\n\"It's an economic impact to your community. It's your connection to, not only\nthe nation, but the world,\" Dalsing said. \"And, obviously, we don't want rural\nAmerica to be left behind.\"\n\nFeatured image by HEATHER AINSWORTH/WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES\n\nEditorial disclaimer: Opinions expressed here are the author\u2019s alone, not\nthose of any bank, credit card issuer, airline or hotel chain, and have not\nbeen reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.\n\n## Great offers from our partners\n\n  * Learn Moreabout The Platinum Card\u00ae from American ExpressTerms Apply\n\nBest luxury travel rewards card\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express\n\nEarn 80,000 points\n\n  * Learn Moreabout Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae CardTerms Apply\n\nBEST FOR BEGINNERS\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card\n\n60,000 bonus points\n\n  * Learn Moreabout Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit CardTerms Apply\n\nSee rates & fees\n\nBest card for premium perks while traveling\n\nCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card\n\nEarn 75,000 miles\n\n  * Learn Moreabout Capital One Venture Rewards Credit CardTerms Apply\n\nSee rates & fees\n\nBest rewards card for non-bonus spending\n\nCapital One Venture Rewards Credit Card\n\nEarn 75,000 miles\n\n  * Learn Moreabout American Express\u00ae Gold CardTerms Apply\n\nBest for the well-traveled foodie\n\nAmerican Express\u00ae Gold Card\n\n60,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae Points\n\nSee all best card offers\n\nRelated stories\n\nGuide\n\nThe best business credit cards with no foreign transaction fees\n\nNews\n\nHyatt\u2019s Mr & Mrs Smith partnership goes live with more than 700 boutique and\nluxury hotels\n\nGuide\n\nThe best time to cruise Alaska\n\nNews\n\nLast chance: Earn up to 185,000 points with these Bonvoy welcome offers\n\n## TPG featured card\n\n## Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Platinum Business American Express Card\n\nApply for Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Platinum Business American Express Card\n\nTerms & restrictions apply.
