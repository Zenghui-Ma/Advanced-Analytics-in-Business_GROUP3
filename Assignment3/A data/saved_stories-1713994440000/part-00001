FDA still considers milk supply\nsafe.\n\nBeth Mole - 4/24/2024, 1:20 AM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty | Edwin Remsberg\n\n#### reader comments\n\n81\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced that genetic fragments\nfrom the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 have been detected in\nthe pasteurized, commercial milk supply. However, the testing completed so\nfar\u2014using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\u2014only detects the\npresence of viral genetic material and cannot tell whether the genetic\nmaterial is from live and infectious viral particles or merely remnants of\ndead ones killed by the pasteurization process.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nConcern grows as bird flu spreads further in US cows: 32 herds in 8 states\n\nTesting is now ongoing to see if viable, infectious H5N1 can be identified in\nmilk samples.\n\nSo far, the FDA still believes that the milk supply is safe. \"To date, we have\nseen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply\nis safe,\" the agency said in a lengthy explanation of the finding and ongoing\ntesting.\n\nH5N1 made its startling jump to US dairy cows recently, with the first-ever\ndocumented cases in a Texas herd confirmed on March 25. It has spread widely\nsince then with at least 32 herds in eight states now known to be infected.\nThe unexpected spread to bovines has raised fears that the virus is evolving\nto infect mammals more efficiently, and so poses a heightened risk of spread\nto and among humans.\n\nBut amid the alarming outbreak among the country's dairy herds, federal\nagencies have appeared confident that the virus poses little risk to no risk\nto the safety of the milk supply.\n\n\"At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a\nrisk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate\ncommercial milk supply because products are pasteurized before entering the\nmarket\" the FDA wrote in an FAQ published Friday. \"Pasteurization has\ncontinually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in\nmilk.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the announcement Tuesday, the FDA also highlighted that multiple studies\nhave shown that the pasteurization process for eggs, which uses lower\ntemperatures than what is used for milk, is effective at inactivating H5N1.\n\nNevertheless, the FDA, along with the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention and the US Department of Agriculture, have continued to investigate\npotential risks, including establishing whether pasteurization can inactivate\nthis specific virus. The FDA noted in its announcement Tuesday that, while\npasteurization is expected to kill the virus, pasteurization is \"different\nthan complete sterilization.\"\n\nAs such, it carried out the qPCR tests, expecting it might find some genetic\nfragments in the pasteurized milk because virus has been detected in raw milk.\n\"Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the\nvirus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral\nparticles,\" the FDA explained. \"Therefore, some of the samples collected have\nindicated the presence of HPAI [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza] using\nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing.\"\n\nThe FDA did not indicate how many samples it has tested, where the samples\nwere collected from, or the level of viral genetic material the samples\ncontained.\n\nThe agency is now working on assessing whether it can identify if any virus\nparticles are infectious using egg inoculation tests, which are considered a\ngold standard for determining viral viability. It added that it will release\nresults from those tests and others in \"the next few days to weeks.\"\n\n\"[W]e take this current situation and the safety of the milk supply very\nseriously. We recognize the importance of releasing further, actionable\ninformation,\" the FDA said.\n\nMeanwhile, the agency reported that the CDC's food safety group has been\nclosely monitoring emergency department data and flu testing data for any\nunusual trends in flu-like illness, flu, or conjunctivitis, which could\nindicate spread of H5N1 to people. \"To date, surveillance systems do not show\nany unusual trends or activity,\" the FDA said.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n81\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
