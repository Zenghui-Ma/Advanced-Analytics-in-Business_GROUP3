The program was\nreleased on March 11, 1995 and discontinued in early 1996. Microsoft Bob\npresented screens showing a house, with rooms that the user could visit\ncontaining familiar objects corresponding to computer applications, such as a\ndesk with pen and paper and a checkbook. Clicking on the pen and paper would\nopen the system's word processor.\n\nA cartoon dog named Rover and other cartoon characters provided guidance using\nspeech balloons.\n\nUpon release, Microsoft Bob was criticized in the media and did not gain wide\nacceptance with users, which resulted in its discontinuation. Its legacy would\nbe observed in future Microsoft products, notably the use of virtual\nassistants. The Rover character later reappeared as a Windows XP search\ncompanion.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nMicrosoft Bob was released in March 1995 (before Windows 95 was released),\nalthough it had been widely publicized under the codename Utopia.^[3]^[4] The\nproject leader for Bob was Karen Fries, a Microsoft researcher. The design was\nbased on research by professors Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves of Stanford\nUniversity.^[5] Melinda Gates, wife of Bill Gates, was the marketing manager\nfor the product.^[6] Microsoft originally purchased the domain name bob.com\nfrom Boston-area techie Bob Antia, but later traded it to Bob Kerstein for the\nwindows2000.com domain name.^[7]\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\nA screenshot of the \"family room\" area of the Microsoft Bob software,\nincluding the \"Assistant\" character Rover\n\nMicrosoft Bob includes various office-suite programs such as a finance\napplication and a word processor. The user interface was designed to simplify\nthe navigational experience for novice computer users.\n\nSimilar to early graphical shells like Jane, the main interface is portrayed\nas the inside of a house, with different rooms corresponding to common real-\nworld room styles such as a kitchen or family room. Each room contains\ndecorations and furniture, as well as icons that represent applications. The\nuser may also fully customize the entire house and has full control over each\nroom's decoration. The user may add, remove or reposition all objects. The\nuser can also add or remove rooms and change the destinations of each door.\nThe program offers multiple themes for room designs and decorations, such as\ncontemporary and postmodern.^[8]\n\nThe applications built into Microsoft Bob are represented by matching\ndecorations. For example, clicking on a clock opens the calendar, while a pen\nand paper represent the word processor. The user can also add shortcuts to\napplications on the computer. These shortcuts display the icon inside various\nstyles of decorations, such as boxes and picture frames.^[9]\n\nBob includes the ability to install new applications, but because of the\nfailure of the product, only a single add-on application package, Microsoft\nGreat Greetings, was released.\n\nReleased just as the Internet was beginning to become popular, Bob offered an\nemail client with which a user could subscribe to MCI Mail, a dial-up email\naccount. The price was $5.00 per month to send up to 15 emails. Each email was\nlimited to 5,000 characters, and each additional email after the limit was\nreached was an additional 45 cents. Customers were required to call a toll-\nfree phone number to set up the account.^[10]\n\nBob features \"Assistants\", cartoon characters intended to help the user\nnavigate the virtual house or perform tasks in the main interface or within\nthe built-in applications.\n\n## Gateway 2000 edition[edit]\n\nAn edition of Microsoft Bob was bundled with the Gateway 2000 computer around\n1995. This edition contains Gateway branding on the login screen along with\nadditional rooms and backgrounds not seen in the retail version. One\nadditional room is the attic, which contains the image of a Gateway 2000\ncomputer box. In addition to the extra rooms, more icons appear by default in\nthe new rooms.^[11]\n\n## Reception and legacy[edit]\n\nAlthough a Consumer Electronics Show demonstration was met with generally\npositive reactions,^[5] reviewers generally derided the software, and\nMicrosoft Bob became one of Microsoft's more visible product failures.^[12]\nThe New York Times found the characters irritating and the home design\napparently the work of an \"esthetically challenged sixth-grader,\" criticized\nthe hardware requirements and storage file formats and concluded that the\nprogram was not as simple to use as Microsoft had advertised.^[13] The\nWashington Post called the home environment \"sterile\" and \"lifeless,\" wrote\nthat the characters' cuteness wore thin quickly and criticized the scarce\ncustomization and access to Windows components.^[14] According to PC Data, the\nreal sales from Bob's release until its discontinuation amounted to only about\n58,000 copies\u2014far short of Microsoft's estimate that it would sell millions as\nhad Microsoft Works and Encarta.^[5] Despite being discontinued just one year\nafter launch, Microsoft Bob continued to be sharply criticized in reviews and\npopular media.^[15] In 2017, Melinda Gates acknowledged that the software\n\"needed a more powerful computer than most people had back then.\"^[6]\n\nMicrosoft Bob was listed seventh in PC World magazine's list of the 25 worst\ntech products of all time^[16] and as the number-one worst product of the\ndecade by CNET.com.^[17] It was also listed among the 50 worst inventions in\nTime magazine, which called Bob \"overly cutesy\" and an \"operating system\ndesigned around Clippy.\"^[18] Microsoft's Steve Ballmer mentioned Bob as an\nexample in which \"we decided that we have not succeeded and let's stop\n[now].\"^[19]\n\nMicrosoft employee Raymond Chen disclosed that an encrypted copy of Bob was\nincluded on Windows XP installation CDs in order to consume space to prevent\npiracy.^[12] It was thought that by consuming an additional 30 megabytes on\nthe disc (in the era of dial-up internet access), users with 56 kbit/s modems\nwould be dissuaded from attempting to download the software illegally.^[20]\nRetired Microsoft engineer David Plummer has identified himself as the\nemployee responsible for the encrypted copy. The installer routine would check\nfor the \"blob of Bob\" and if an \"OEM blob\" was detected, only an OEM product\nkey would be accepted.^[21]^[22] Tech journalist Harry McCracken called the\nstory \"a delightfully urban legend-y tale\" and noted its similarities to an\nApril Fools' Day joke claiming that Bob was hidden in Windows Vista.^[23]\n\nThe use of virtual assistants in Microsoft Bob later inspired Clippit,\nnicknamed \"Clippy\" the paperclip, the default Office Assistant in Microsoft\nOffice. Rover, the dog mascot character introduced with Bob, became a \"search\ncompanion\" for Windows XP's file-search function.^[24]\n\nMicrosoft graphic designer Vincent Connare designed the typeface Comic Sans\nwhen he noticed that Rover's speech was displayed in Times New Roman, which he\nfelt was inappropriate for a cartoon dog. Although Connare's font did not\nappear in the final release of Microsoft Bob because its characters did not\nfit within any of the typographical grids, it later debuted in Microsoft's 3D\nMovie Maker and became an additional typeface for Windows 95.^[25]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Skeuomorph\n  * Orphaned technology\n  * Packard Bell Navigator\n  * eWorld\n\nMicrosoft\n\n  * Microsoft Agent\n  * Cortana\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"Lifecycle Information for Microsoft Obsolete Products Support\". support.microsoft.com.
