Last year only a third of Great Britain\u2019s electricity came from\nfossil fuels, compared with 40% from renewables.\n\nThe research, undertaken by Carbon Brief, found a dramatic increase in the\nfrequency of short periods when fossil fuels made up less than 5% of Great\nBritain\u2019s electricity generation in recent months.\n\nThere have been 75 half-hour periods in the year to date when fossil fuels\nhave accounted for less than 5% of the country\u2019s electricity needs, more than\nfour times the number recorded last year. Just five ultra-low carbon half\nhours were recorded in 2022, the analysis said.\n\nThe new record low took place amid a glut of renewable energy, according to\nthe ESO. At the time, wind power made up about half of electricity generation\nwhile solar power accounted for just over 30%. Britain\u2019s nuclear reactors\ngenerated more than 13%.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

The plant is\ndue to close in September.\n\nDyke said: \u201cThis is a culmination of a significant amount of effort over a\nnumber of years. It\u2019s not just about technologies, it\u2019s about hearts and minds\nand processes and systems and people working together across the industry, the\nenergy regulator and government.\n\n\u201cGetting to the 2025 ambition has been a significant engineering challenge,\nwhich we are solving.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Energy industry\n  * Fossil fuels\n  * Energy\n  * Energy efficiency\n  * Green economy\n  * National Grid\n  * Coal\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### England could produce 13 times more renewable energy, using less than 3% of land \u2013 analysis\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Scottish Power to pay out \u00a31.5m after overcharging 1,700 households\n\n16 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Only 1,500 people compensated so far over prepayment meters, Ofgem says\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### World\u2019s largest solar manufacturer to cut one-third of workforce\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### New blow to British smart meter rollout as number of faulty machines leaps to 4m\n\n26 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### African leaders call for equity over minerals used for clean energy\n\n28 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### EU countries already hitting some of their sustainable energy targets for 2030\n\n28 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### UK government accused of trying to \u2018stoke culture war on climate issues\u2019\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### What does Sunak\u2019s plan for new gas plants mean for UK climate targets?\n\n12 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Danish windfarm firm \u00d8rsted to axe up to 800 jobs and pause dividend\n\n7 Feb 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
