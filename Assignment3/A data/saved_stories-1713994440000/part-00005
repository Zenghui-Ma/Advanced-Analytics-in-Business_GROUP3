The stock is down more than $100\nper share year-to-date, as many as 20,000 people are set to lose their jobs,\nthe Cybertruck keeps breaking, operating profit is expected to be down 40\npercent when it\u2019s announced later today and the $25,000 electric vehicle that\nTesla has reportedly been working on is apparently canceled. As the Wall\nStreet Journal reports, some but not all of that stress can be attributed to\nTesla alienating what was previously its most valuable demographic \u2014\nDemocrats.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nIt Sure Looks Like Layoffs Are Coming To Tesla\n\nTesla Cybertruck Embarrasses Itself In Tug Of War With Silverado HD\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nHistorically, Democrats have bought Teslas in significantly larger numbers\nthan people with other political affiliations. As Elon Musk has moved to the\nright, interacting with far-right accounts, promoting race \u201cscience,\u201d anti-\nSemitism, homophobia, transphobia and complaining about the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d\nthough, the number of Democrats interested in giving him their money has\ndropped significantly. Late last year, that figure reportedly dropped by more\nthan 60 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nIt Sure Looks Like Layoffs Are Coming To Tesla\n\nTesla Cybertruck Embarrasses Itself In Tug Of War With Silverado HD\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nUnfortunately for Tesla, while Republicans have embraced Musk\u2019s political\nheel-turn, they haven\u2019t necessarily been buying his cars in large enough\nnumbers to offset the sharp drop in interest from left-leaning people. That\u2019s\nlikely due in part to Republican politicians using EVs as an example of how\nDemocrats want to destroy the auto industry, control your life and force you\nto own nothing and eat bugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile surveys have found lower consumer interest in Teslas ever since Musk\nbought Twitter, when it came to actual sales, Democrats didn\u2019t really start to\ndrop off significantly until last October. They made up 40 percent of Tesla\u2019s\nsales for the 2022 model year and 39 percent for 2023, yet when the 2024 model\nyear Teslas went on sale, the number of Democrats in the mix dropped to 15\npercent.\n\nEven with Republicans and Independents buying more Teslas, first-quarter sales\nstill dropped overall, with deliveries down even more significantly. You\ndidn\u2019t necessarily have to wait for Q1's results to see this coming, though,\nas Tesla sales were up 43 percent in California in Q3 but dropped 10 percent\nin Q4.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Tesla had the exclusivity of its Supercharger network as its trump\ncard. Other EVs may have been capable of a road trip on paper, but the non-\nTesla charging network is still unreliable at best, so if you planned to use\nyour EV as more than a daily driver, Tesla was still the best option\navailable. It may be a coincidence, but late fall is also about the time that\nit became clear that every automaker in the U.S. would be switching to Tesla\u2019s\nNorth American Charging Standard and would have access to the Supercharger\nnetwork. By allowing non-Teslas to use its charging network, Tesla may have\nfinally freed Democrats who would have previously bought a Tesla reluctantly\nto instead buy their next EV from a competitor.\n\nThat said, Democratic sales have rebounded a bit since last fall. By the end\nof February, they were back up to 35 percent of Tesla\u2019s sales mix. \u201cElon\nhasn\u2019t been in the press as much as he has previously,\u201d Strategic Vision\u2019s\nAlexander Edwards told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThis lack of negative press\nand antics, combined with EV [shoppers] today...shopping various EVs and they\nfind that the Model 3 and Y are still, in their opinion, the best decision\nbased on value.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that\u2019s true, then we\u2019ll be especially interested to see what more recent\nnumbers look like. The Cybertruck has quickly become a national embarrassment,\nwith one even being defeated by a simple car wash. And with even more negative\npress expected to come out of today\u2019s earnings call, Musk isn\u2019t exactly doing\nthe best job of staying out of the news these days, which according to Edwards\ncan only mean bad news for Tesla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
