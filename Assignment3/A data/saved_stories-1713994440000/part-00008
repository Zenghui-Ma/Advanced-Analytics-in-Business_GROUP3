However,\nas the culture war has heated up, these services have become increasingly\npolitical. AWS effectively killed Parler on January 10, 2021, when it cut the\nright-leaning social network\u2019s hosting. For a website to exist, it needs to be\nhosted by a provider. This reality has meant websites with wrongthink can be\nkicked off the internet until they can find a company to host them.\n\nIf we are to have any hope of countering this trend and returning to a truly\nneutral net, we need new companies to provide those basic services and\nchallenge quasi-monopolies like Amazon. American Cloud is one such company\nthat is taking on AWS head-on.\n\nWhen AWS shut down Parler, American Cloud CEO and co-founder Aron Wagner saw\nan opportunity to serve organizations that incumbent cloud providers rejected\nfor philosophical reasons, like firearm companies, alternative health\nservices, and certain online ministries. He believed that he could provide\nthose services for a fraction of the cost.\n\n\u201cWe're passionate about providing reliable digital infrastructure. We're\ntrying to make that as easy as possible and as accessible as possible for any\nU.S.-based business,\u201d Wagner said.\n\n\u201cWe need to be focused on that and making sure that it\u2019s effectively a utility\nfor a customer to be able to grow and scale their business, and not about\nvirtue-signaling or answering DEI or ESG,\u201d Wagner added.\n\nI asked Wagner why he thinks so many companies have become increasingly\npolitical, even when it seems to threaten their core business. Wagner thinks\nit\u2019s a combination of pressure from stockholders and other customers.\n\n\u201cAfter Parler got kicked out of AWS, some infrastructure providers were\nunwilling to service them, because they were worried about their customers\nbacklashing against it. And so they felt handcuffed by who they were already\nproviding service to,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nAnd how does American Cloud plan to avoid being stuck in a similar situation?\n\n### Sign up for the Return newsletter\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and agree to\nreceive content that may sometimes include advertisements.

As long as it's legal\ncommerce, we're here to support it, even if we disagree with it,\u201d Wagner said.\n\n## A highly prepared cloud provider\n\nBut how does American Cloud keep itself and its 72,000-square-foot foot data\ncenter from being canceled by the services it relies upon?\n\n\u201cWe own the security perimeter, we own the land, we own the building, we own\nall the gear inside of the building \u2014 all the power, cooling, networking, and\nservers,\u201d Wagner said. Additionally, American Cloud has contracts with over a\ndozen Tier 1 network providers, so if one were to cut off the company, it has\nplenty of backup internet connections. And even if all of those cut ties,\nAmerican Cloud owns dark fiber that it could use to create its own backbone.\n\n\u201cFrom an outside threat perspective, power utilities are probably a bigger\nthreat than bandwidth providers,\u201d Wagner said. And even in that case, the\ncompany is prepared to run the data center entirely on diesel if it comes to\nit.\n\n\u201cIf the utility provider were to cut off power to the data center, I think our\ncountry would be in a much worse position than we think it is today,\u201d Wagner\nsaid.\n\nWagner\u2019s background in the United States Army helped give him that\npreparedness mindset. He served as a Ranger in the 82nd Airborne, where he\nparticipated in Operation Inherent Resolve, fighting ISIS in Iraq. He had\nplanned to transition into special forces, but he was prevented from doing so\nfor medical reasons.\n\n\u201cI was honestly planning on being a lifer,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIt was an extremely\nrewarding experience, but it wasn't my goal to be in what we'd call the Big\nArmy.\u201d\n\nNear the end of his Army tenure, Wagner signed up for the DOD SkillBridge\nprogram, in which soldiers get to intern at a company for four months while\nstill on active duty. He landed at a data center consultancy firm in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina. \u201cI really fell in love with the physical side of digital\ninfrastructure and the internet,\u201d Wagner said.\n\n## American Cloud for all\n\nWagner emphasized that American Cloud isn\u2019t a purely ideological company.\nUnlike some others in this space, which compensate for mediocre pricing or a\npoor customer experience by targeting an underserved niche, American Cloud\naims to offer better service at a better price point.\n\n\u201cOur target audience is really U.S.-based businesses, and it doesn't have to\nonly be industries that have been underserved by the other cloud providers,\u201d\nWager said.\n\nWagner said that businesses looking to transition from AWS to American Cloud\ncan expect to cut their bill by about 25%, and AC has saved some customers\n70%-80%.\n\n\u201cThese are non-political, non-controversial companies; they're just looking\nfor better bang for their buck at the end of the day,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nI found it surprising that American Cloud doesn\u2019t yet accept cryptocurrency\npayments, but Wagner assured me that it\u2019s coming later this year.\n\nSo if your business needs cloud hosting or you\u2019d like to explore an\nalternative to AWS and other tech giants, check out American Cloud and see if\nit\u2019s a good fit for you.\n\n## Want to leave a tip?\n\nWe answer to you.
