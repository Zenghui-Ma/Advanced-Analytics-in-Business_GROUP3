These workers were\nneither calculating geniuses nor idiot savants but knowledgeable people who,\nin other circumstances, might have become scientists in their own right. When\nComputers Were Human represents the first in-depth account of this little-\nknown, 200-year epoch in the history of science and technology. Beginning with\nthe story of his own grandmother, who was trained as a human computer, David\nAlan Grier provides a poignant introduction to the wider world of women and\nmen who did the hard computational labor of science. His grandmother's casual\nremark, \"I wish I'd used my calculus, \" hinted at a career deferred and an\neducation forgotten, a secret life unappreciated; like many highly educated\nwomen of her generation, she studied to become a human computer because\nnothing else would offer her a place in the scientific world. The book begins\nwith the return of Halley's comet in 1758 and the effort of three French\nastronomers to compute its orbit. It ends four cycles later, with a UNIVAC\nelectronic computer projecting the 1986 orbit. In between, Grier tells us\nabout the surveyors of the French Revolution, describes the calculating\nmachines of Charles Babbage, and guides the reader through the Great\nDepression to marvel at the giant computing room of the Works Progress\nAdministration. When Computers Were Human is the sad but lyrical story of\nworkers who gladly did the hard labor of research calculation in the hope that\nthey might be part of the scientific community. In the end, they were rewarded\nby a new electronic machine that took the place and the name of those who\nwere, once, the computers.\u201d\n\ndate open sourced\n\n2022-03-08 (ol_source: 2020-08-23, isbndb_scrape: 2022-09-01, lgli_source:\n2022-03-08, zlib_source: 2024-03-22)\n\nRead more...\n\nISBN-13978-1-4008-4936-9 ISBN-101-4008-4936-5 Open LibraryOL29181394M Open\nLibraryOL8328377W Z-Library28126325 MD5fb8bf2acfd3087e48e7812acc8a528ba\nLibgen.li File97485279 Libgen.li libgen_id3339113 LCCQA303.2.G75 2005eb\n\nISBN-13: 978-1-4008-4936-9 / 9781400849369\n\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources?isbn=9781400849369\n\nWebsite: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN\n\nAA: Search Anna\u2019s Archive for \u201cisbn13:9781400849369\u201d\n\nISBN-10: 1-4008-4936-5 / 1400849365\n\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources?isbn=1400849365\n\nWebsite: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN\n\nAA: Search Anna\u2019s Archive for \u201cisbn10:1400849365\u201d\n\nOpen Library: OL29181394M\n\nURL: https://openlibrary.org/books/OL29181394M\n\nAA: Search Anna\u2019s Archive for \u201col:OL29181394M\u201d\n\nOpen Library: OL8328377W\n\nURL: https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8328377W\n\nAA: Search Anna\u2019s Archive for \u201col:OL8328377W\u201d\n\nZ-Library: 28126325\n\nURL: https://zlibrary-sk.se/\n\nWebsite: /datasets/zlib\n\nAA: Search Anna\u2019s Archive for \u201czlib:28126325\u201d\n\nMD5: fb8bf2acfd3087e48e7812acc8a528ba\n\nWebsite: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5\n\nAA: Search Anna\u2019s Archive for \u201cmd5:fb8bf2acfd3087e48e7812acc8a528ba\u201d\n\nLibgen.li File: 97485279\n\nGlobal file ID in Libgen.li.
