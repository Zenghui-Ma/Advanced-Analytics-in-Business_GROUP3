They are, as Coase might have put it, individuals\nbrought together through a governance charter to do things they couldn't\neasily do alone or with too high transaction costs. But they're often fickle,\nand fail to adapt to the changing world.\n\nGeoffrey West, of the Santa Fe institute in his studies of scaling laws says\nin the section where he applies it to companies:\n\n> An extrapolation of the theory and data predicts that the probability of a\n> company\u2019s lasting for one hundred years is only about forty-five in a\n> million, and for it to last two hundred years it\u2019s a minuscule one in a\n> billion. These numbers should not be taken too seriously, but they do give\n> us a sense of the scale of long-term survivability and provide an\n> interesting insight into the characteristics of companies that have remained\n> viable for hundreds of years. There are at least 100 million companies in\n> the world, so if they all obey similar dynamics, then one would expect only\n> about 4,500 to survive for a hundred years, but none for two hundred.\n\nHe also went on to say that this is clearly not true. There are firms that\nhave been around for much longer. But re those, West thinks:\n\n> Most of them are of relatively modest size, operating in highly specialized\n> niche markets, such as ancient inns, wineries, breweries, confectioners,\n> restaurants, and the like.\n\nSo I took a look at these types of companies who seem to defy death to see if\nthis conception holds up.\n\n###\n\n1\\. The forever companies\n\nJapan is interesting in so many ways. But one of the most interesting is the\nfact that the country has 33,000 businesses that are at least a century old!\nOften called shinise meaning \"old shop\", many have been around for much much\nlonger. For instance, Tsuen Tea in Kyoto has been a going concern since 1160\nAD. They survived for almost a millennium by doing one thing and one thing\nonly (serving tea, in case that was unclear). Their current owner says:\n\n> We\u2019ve focused on tea and haven\u2019t expanded the business too much. That\u2019s why\n> we\u2019re surviving.\n\nAnd they're not alone. Japan also has:\n\n  * The oldest hotel in the world, open since 705 in Yamanashi\n\n  * Confectioner Ichimonjiya Wasuke selling sweet treats in Kyoto since 1000\n\n  * Hosoo, a kimono manufacturer started in 1688\n\nAnd a way longer list of companies that are older than most countries.\n\nOne common trend amongst most of these companies is that they are dedicated to\ndoing one thing and one thing well. There's little ambition to grow, to\nexpand, or to try new things. Sure they might change recipes, or remix\ningredients, or have minor variations on what can be served in the tea house,\nbut in essence, what's being provided in the year 2020 is very similar to what\nwould've been provided a century ago, or a millennium ago.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> According to a report published by the Bank of Korea in 2008 that looked at\n> 41 countries, there were 5,586 companies older than 200 years. Of these,\n> 3,146 (56%) are in Japan, 837 (15%) in Germany, 222 (4%) in the Netherlands,\n> and 196 (3%) in France. Of the companies with more than 100 years of\n> history, most of them (89%) employ fewer than 300 people.\n\nAnd there are more. For instance, have a glance at the oldest firms in major\ncountries.\n\n(Yes after looking at this I like Canada even more than I did before)\n\n###\n\n2\\. The innovative giants\n\nAnd it's not just the little mom and pop shops either. Once we bring the\naverage age down to a century of two, we see a few larger companies.\n\n  * A construction giant Takenaka, founded in 1610\n\n  * Suntory and Nintendo, both born in the 1800s\n\nA BBC article states:\n\n> Many of these oldest companies are medium or small family-owned\n> organisations focusing on hospitality and food, like Tsuen Tea. Several\n> companies have even benefited from the widely-accepted Japanese practice of\n> adopting adult male workers into the family bloodline to ensure an unbroken\n> succession for the business, something even huge firms like Suzuki Motor and\n> Panasonic have done.\n\nThen there are companies like GE, started in 1892, who still exist as large\nongoing concerns. After having been started by Thomas Edison to do work in\nelectricity related fields, they expanded over the years to Aviation, Capital,\nDigital, Nuclear energy, Healthcare, Power and Finance.\n\nA funny coincidence (?) is that there are plenty of banks and insurance\ncompanies in this group. There are 231 banks that started before 1900s. The\noldest is, of course, in Italy where Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena in\nFlorence founded in 1624. Bank of England started in 1694. Bank of Scotland\nstarted in 1695. But more recently, Schroders started in 1804, Rothschild &\nSons started in 1811. State Bank of India started in 1806.\n\nSimilarly for insurance, its beginning was with property insurance. The Great\nFire of London started the trend in 1666, and as a result Nicholas Barbon\nstarted fire insurance in 1681. Things started roughly around the same time\nabroad as well:\n\n> Hamburger Feuerkasse is the first officially established fire insurance\n> company in the world, and the oldest existing insurance enterprise available\n> to the public, having started in 1676\n\nLater, the life insurance industry in the US started in the 1760s, where\nPresbyterian Synods in Philadelphia and New York founded the Corporation for\nRelief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in\n1759. Then the other priests started comparable relief funds alongside. The\nsame motif continued with Accident insurance, National insurance, and more!\n\nNon-commercial entities\n\nThings get even more interesting when you look at the non-commercial entities.\nFor instance, started in 930AD, and as the longest running parliament in the\nworld, Iceland has almost everyone beat. Maybe San Marino should also deserve\na mention. Despite it being small enough to jump across, they do have written\ndocuments dating back to before Constantine, to 301 AD.\n\nEven the British Empire can date back to Magna Carta in 1215, but that, as far\nas I can tell, required a fair bit of colonialization to ensure continuation.\n\n###\n\nSummary\n\nThe conclusion of this little digression has been to find common grounds\namongst the most long lived organisations, and turns out you need to be a\nparticular type of company:\n\nExtreme dedication to doing one thing well\n\nWhether it's running a tea shop in Kyoto or a bank in Florence, the same\nprinciples seem to apply. You focus all your energies on doing one thing well,\nget known for it, and remain small intentionally so that all you keep doing is\nthat one thing.\n\nCould Tsuen Tea expand? I'm sure it could! Which Private Equity wouldn't want\nto fund that expansion? But they don't. Because that would dilute the whole\nbrand and value proposition. Small, well known, artisanal endeavours with long\nhistories don\u2019t duplicate themselves well.\n\nFocus on survival above other considerations\n\nGE, Suzuki, Mitsubishi and others of its ilk focused on survival rather than\n\"core competencies\". They were happy to open up new areas of businesses,\nalmost seemingly at random. The young whippersnapper Samsung, only started in\n1938, has already gone through iterations of being focused on being a trading\ncompany, food processing, textiles, insurance, and now emergent in technology!\nEven in electronics they refocused regularly, going from televisions, to\naudio, to phones and beyond.\n\nThe literature on conglomerates more broadly, which these companies could be\nconsidered as, states that they are not ideal investments in many cases\nbecause of the inherent diversification of income streams they offer. That's\nwhat creates the conglomerate discount. There's a paper by Lewellen that\nsuggests that \"the conglomerate merger between two firms is warranted to the\nextent that the diversification effect of combining two income streams reduces\nthe probability of bankruptcy.\"\n\nBut the very fact that they have inherent diversification of relatively\nindependent revenue streams is also what makes them more resilient. They do\nwhat makes money and are fearless about exploring their adjacencies. That's\nwhy Yamaha can make pianos and motorcycles, and Samsung makes buildings and\ncellphones. They're not bound by much apart from the motivation to make money.\n\nCoda\n\nOne metric I wish existed is something I\u2019ve started calling Company Lifetime\nValue, just like customer lifetime value or employee lifetime value. It's the\ncumulative profit that a company can and will generate over its lifetime. Now\nnormally it's artificially circumscribed by our investment horizons and\nlifespan, so there's a point it just becomes asymptotic, but nonetheless I've\nfound it useful to figure out what type of an organisation it is I\u2019m dealing\nwith.\n\nIn that frame, having a company that has the ability to survive for longer\nperiods of time is an advantage. It is a natural way to hedge against the fact\nthat our publicly traded companies are seeing their lifespans come down.\n\nAnd the way to do that is to find companies like GE who can survive anything.\nWhich, funnily enough, makes them look a lot more like cities rather than\ncompanies.\n\nGeoffrey West in his analysis of scaling laws affecting companies, organisms\nand cities writes:\n\n> Although there are significant differences, it\u2019s hard not to be struck by\n> how similar the growth and death of companies and organisms are when viewed\n> through the lens of scaling\u2014and how dissimilar they both are to cities. ...\n> The fact that companies scale sublinearly, rather than superlinearly like\n> cities, suggests that they epitomize the triumph of economies of scale over\n> innovation and idea creation. ... In contrast, cities embody the triumph of\n> innovation over the hegemony of economies of scale. ... They operate in a\n> much more distributed fashion, with power spread across multiple\n> organizational structures from mayors and councils to businesses and citizen\n> action groups. No single group has absolute control. As such, they exude an\n> almost laissez-faire, freewheeling ambience relative to companies,\n\nCompanies, as we understand them, have mission statements and a purpose. They\nhave a vision led by a founder or CEO and they have at least some semblance of\nunderstanding as to what their \"focus\" should be and their \"core competencies\"\nare.\n\nPart of the answer is surely that they want to provide predictability to\nemployees and investors in terms of what they are going to do. Circumscribing\nthe possible actions help with justifying and understanding the future.\n\nBut surely do what makes money is a better defining characteristic?\n\nAre there other companies out there that do similar things? Probably.\nBerkshire Hathaway is one. There's no justification or vision beyond invest in\ngreat companies. KKR does this too, they just want to find a deal, and don't\ncare at all whether the company is in technology or healthcare or oil.\n\nBut Microsoft isn't going to go start a restaurant chain. And Facebook won't\ngo start a semiconductor manufacturing plant.\n\nImagine if you're the city of Miami. You make your recurring revenue services\nfrom attracting companies to relocate and taxing them. Do you care if the\ncompanies that come over are in social media or semiconductor or auto or a\nrestaurant chain? All you care is that they come, get set up, employ people\nand you get to collect taxes.\n\nIn other words they only optimise for the revenues, and don't care at all\nabout how that's brought in.\n\nThe price of immortality is staying small and in your lane. The price of\nlongevity is to continually hunt for the next dollar wherever you can, and be\nruthless with your sacred cows, with limited guarantee of success even then.\nThe price of following your passion and charging ahead in a given direction,\nthat prize is the Elvis Presley of prizes - to live fast, die young, and leave\na good looking corpse.\n\nOr you could start a bank. Those things look like they never die!\n\n### Subscribe to Strange Loop Canon\n\nBy Rohit Krishnan \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\n\u201cAny fool can know.
