Why, come to it, do they make love?\n\nWhy do human beings make war? Why, come to it, do they make love?\n\nWe tend to see these patterns of human behavior as part of our psychological\nessence. Call it, quaintly, \u201chuman nature.\u201d But it\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d as opposed to\nwhat? The traditional answer has been \u201cculture,\u201d or even more quaintly,\n\u201ccivilization.\u201d The norms of civilized life\u2014our complex systems of law,\ncustom, and etiquette\u2014are typically seen as things grafted onto our natures,\nnot strictly essential to our humanity.\n\nThe Invention of Prehistory: Empire, Violence, and Our Obsession with Human\nOrigins, Stefanos Geroulanos, W. W. Norton & Company, 512 pp., .99, April 2024\n\nThe Invention of Prehistory: Empire, Violence, and Our Obsession with Human\nOrigins, Stefanos Geroulanos, W. W. Norton & Company, 512 pp., $29.99, April\n2024\n\nWhat, then, is essential to being human? And how could we ever know? A simple\nanswer suggests itself to the second question: We can look at what human\nbeings were like before civilization. That\u2019s the period of time that we call\n\u201cprehistory.\u201d But it\u2019s in the nature of prehistory that there is no\nconventional archive. We are left to speculate or, more dully, to infer what\nwe can from archeological remains\u2014a bone or stone tool here, a cave painting\nthere.\n\nThe study of prehistory will never yield a story with anything like the\ngranular detail and certainty of even a short history of the First World War.\nBut given that studies of our prehistoric past have been going concerns for\nwell-nigh three centuries now\u2014engaging some of our best zoologists,\nneuroscientists, archeologists, geneticists, and philosophers\u2014one would hope\nthat they have culminated in some knowledge of what those very early humans\nwere like.\n\nStefanos Geroulanos is skeptical. A historian who teaches at New York\nUniversity, in a new book titled The Invention of Prehistory: Empire,\nViolence, and Our Obsession with Human Origins, he declares that pretty much\nevery hypothesis about the prehistoric origins of humanity is not science, but\n\u201cpure ideology.\u201d He is using the word in its Marxist sense of a belief that is\nheld not because there are grounds for supposing it to be true but because it\nserves somebody\u2019s interests\u2014typically, the interests of those with power. The\nstudy of prehistory, Geroulanos writes, claims to be scientific and objective,\nbut it is \u201coften more a narcissistic fantasy than a field of inquiry.\u201d\n\nHis dense and fact-rich book makes the case for the prosecution at compelling\nlength: The so-called science of human origins can tell us little worth\nknowing about humanity. Its record, he claims, is grim. It has helped to\nrationalize the destruction of Indigenous peoples around the world, to\ndehumanize the victims of Nazism, and to provide pernicious metaphors for\nthinking about refugees. He dramatically concludes: \u201cHumanity still bleeds\nbecause of our obsession with defining some group of our fellows according to\na supposedly savage past.\u201d\n\nThese are bold charges. In 20 punchy chapters, Geroulanos takes us through\nseveral episodes in the history of prehistory: the quest for the lost \u201cAryan\u201d\nlanguage from which many of the languages of Europe and Asia evolved, the\nconstantly changing scientific consensus on what the Neanderthals were like,\nthe many political uses of prehistoric hypotheses to justify one or another\ncontemporary practice as being truer to an essential human nature undistorted\nby the pressures of civilization.\n\nAn illustration in muted but abundant colors depicts cavemen with spears\nattacking large wild animals, including bears, a hippo, lions, an elephant or\nmammoth, and dinosaurs. The hunters are dressed in animal skins and surrounded\nby tropical flora. A group of women shelter inside a dark cave in the corner.\n\nAn illustration of a tribe of prehistoric \u201ccavemen\u201d battling ferocious\nanimals, circa 1906. GraphicaArtis/Getty Images\n\nThe relatively well-known figures in his history are given their due: Jean-\nJacques Rousseau and his influential ideas about the \u201cstate of nature,\u201d\nCharles Darwin\u2019s account of human evolution in The Descent of Man, Karl Marx\nand Friedrich Engels\u2019s account of the \u201cprimitive communism\u201d that may have\nmarked prehistoric societies, and Sigmund Freud\u2019s theory of neurosis as an\n\u201catavistic vestige.\u201d\n\nGeroulanos doesn\u2019t stop at rehearsing these relatively familiar ideas. He also\nprovides detailed and stimulating discussions of the French utopian thinker\nHenri de Saint-Simon, the attempts made by once-popular Jesuit scientist and\nphilosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to reconcile Darwinian theory with\nCatholic doctrine, and The Inheritors, William Golding\u2019s excellent novel\nfeaturing gentle, intuitive Neanderthals. Nor does Geroulanos restrict himself\nto literary texts, commenting insightfully on the opening scene of Stanley\nKubrick\u2019s film 2001: A Space Odyssey, on the alternative history of the world\ndepicted in the 2018 Marvel film Black Panther, and the claim of certain\npopular weight-loss techniques to be based on our knowledge of prehistoric\nhuman diets.\n\nThe book is rich in revealing anecdotes. It is fascinating, for instance, to\nlearn that when the anthropologist W. H. R. Rivers stood as a Labour Party\ncandidate for the British Parliament in 1922, he was greeted by the charge\nthat his party\u2019s principles were fundamentally opposed to human nature. He\nresponded by delivering lectures on the communism of prehistoric man to assure\nhis voters that socialism was entirely natural to human beings. When the\nGerman army lost Southern Italy to the Allies, Nazi military commander\nHeinrich Himmler still thought it worth dispatching an SS detachment to San\nMarino to find the earliest existing copy of the Roman historian Tacitus\u2019s\nGermania, which some Nazis believed might give their expansionism a\njustification in prehistory.\n\nGeroulanos connects ideas and people not commonly discussed together,\nrevealing historical patterns not much remarked upon, making his book\ninformative and valuable even for readers who may know something about the\nparticular authors and historical episodes that he writes about. But\nGeroulanos is not only interested in a critique of particular authors or\nhypotheses. His claim appears to be much more sweeping.\n\nPrehistory is not, as he sees it, an honorable pursuit that is often\ndishonorably carried out; it is rotten through and through, and we would be\nbetter off without it. Can he sustain this stronger claim?\n\nAn illustration shows six stages of human development from a crouched ape to a\nman walking upright. Side profiles of the skulls are seen above each figure,\ndemonstrating the growth of the brain cavity over time, the shrinking of the\nbrow bone, and other changes.\n\nA depiction of hominid evolution through time, circa 1900.Dea Picture\nLibrary/De Agostini via Getty Images\n\nI am not sure that he can. For one thing, Geroulanos does not make it easy to\nfollow his argument. Attitudes toward his style will inevitably differ, but I\ndid not take to his persistent sarcasm. Darwin is accused of assembling\n\u201cmasses of tedious evidence,\u201d 19-century linguists of \u201cmind-numbingly dry\ncomparative analysis.\u201d But what else is a scholar supposed to do? The art\nhistorian Kenneth Clark\u2019s influential 1969 BBC documentary series,\nCivilisation, is dismissed as \u201castonishingly priggish,\u201d the Canadian\npsychologist Jordan Peterson as Carl \u201cJung\u2019s shallowest disciple,\u201d and the\nIsraeli writer Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s bestselling Sapiens as a \u201cdeceptive\nhodgepodge.\u201d These drive-by shootings of fellow scholars strike me as\nunbecoming: Why not simply set out their arguments and explain what\u2019s wrong\nwith them?\n\nFor an author aiming not just to collect salutary warnings from history, but\nalso to derive from them a philosophical moral about the value of all research\ninto human origins, Geroulanos is oddly reluctant to make any philosophical\narguments. He damns, instead, by association, evaluating ideas and arguments\nnot in terms of their truth or validity but the consequences of pursuing them.\n\n\u201cThe search for origins,\u201d he writes, \u201cbegan in and then contributed to a long,\nbrutal history of conquest and empire. It has been drunk on hierarchy. It is\nrooted in illusions\u2014often murderous ones. It has served ferocious power. Its\nbeautiful ideas have justified force against those deemed weak, different,\nugly. It has rationalized colonial domination and eugenics. It has contributed\nto the destruction of Indigenous peoples.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric is powerful, but the metaphors are confused and ill-chosen: Can a\n\u201csearch\u201d be simultaneously \u201cdrunk\u201d and \u201crooted\u201d? And what are we supposed to\nmake of that toothless phrase, \u201ccontributed to\u201d? If Geroulanos\u2019s apparent\nstandard for condemning ideas is applied more broadly, it would rule out most\nscientific research. We need some further reason to think that the terrible\nthings can be blamed on the inquiries themselves and not, for instance, on the\nracism or callousness of those who pursued them.\n\nWhen one strips away the ominous rhetoric, one is left with three claims that\nGeroulanos might be making. He might be saying, modestly and plausibly, that\ntheories of human origins, even when we can know them to be true, cannot by\nthemselves justify any claim about how human society should be. Or he might be\nadvancing a more ambitious skeptical thesis: that it is impossible to know the\ntruth about prehistoric humans. But at times, he appears to be saying\nsomething even more radically skeptical than that\u2014that there is no truth to be\nknown about human origins.\n\nRead More\n\nPresident Barack Obama (C) presents a 2012 National Humanities Medal to\nCanadian and American historian Natalie Zemon Davis (L) during a ceremony in\nthe East Room of the White House on July 10, 2013 in Washington, DC.President\nBarack Obama (C) presents a 2012 National Humanities Medal to Canadian and\nAmerican historian Natalie Zemon Davis (L) during a ceremony in the East Room\nof the White House on July 10, 2013 in Washington, DC.\n\n### The History Crisis Is a National Security Problem\n\nAs universities shed scholars, key learning disappears.\n\nArgument\n\n|\n\nBret Devereaux\n\nThe first of these claims strikes me as both true and important, but it might\nbe made quite simply without the detailed historical excursus. The idea that\none can understand the true nature and purpose of anything by looking to its\norigins has long been diagnosed as the fallacy it patently is\u2014as if things\ncannot evolve or accrue new qualities and purposes in the course of their\nhistories.\n\nHis second claim about the impossibility of knowing about our origins is in\ntension with what he rightly concedes in other places about new genetic\nresearch; for instance, the kind of work studying the Neanderthal genome that\nwon the Swedish paleogeneticist Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo his Nobel Prize. But Geroulanos\u2019s\npraise of this research is backhanded: \u201cHowever much we may \u2018know\u2019 about [the\nNeanderthal], he continues to say more about us.\u201d The point is well taken, but\nthe scare-quotes around \u201cknow\u201d are not.\n\nThe extent of Geroulanos\u2019s skepticism becomes clearer in his claim that the\npast \u201cdoes not exist independently, suspended in amber, waiting for us. ...\nEvery time we find old bones, we dream up a primal scene and flesh it out with\ndetails from our own time.\u201d To the extent that I can discern an argument in\nthese passages, it seems to be this: Claims about the distant past cannot be\nproven for certain. When we inquire into the origins of humanity, the stakes\nof that inquiry for our self-understanding mean that we are unable to be\nobjective about it. The actual history of these inquiries reveals that their\ndiscoveries have nearly always been put to nefarious uses. Therefore, research\ninto human origins is either impossible, or worthless, or wicked. We are\nbetter off not doing it.\n\nIf there must be inquiry into human prehistory, Geroulanos would rather it\ntook the form of creative and politically engaged mythmaking. Of all the many\norigin stories he chronicles, he has the most sympathy for the imaginative\npictures of feminist theorists such as Elaine Morgan. If Morgan\u2019s myth of a\nprimal matriarchy is, as he puts it, \u201cproudly speculative,\u201d it was no more\nspeculative than those of her male contemporaries who sought to find the\nprimeval origins of (and therefore justifications for) the patriarchy. \u201cWe\nneed better origin myths,\u201d he paraphrases her as saying, making it clear that\n\u201cbetter\u201d here does not mean more accurate, but rather more politically useful.\n\nI need no argument to feel the force of Geroulanos\u2019s least provocative but\nmost plausible claim: that there is little to be learned about what human\nbeings are really like by looking at what they were like back in the\nPleistocene (the epoch before our current one, when modern humans evolved).\nWhat human beings are supposedly really like is what we know them to be\nactually like: destructive and creative, prone to violence and capable of\npeace. If patriarchy is good for us, then it needs to be good for us now, not\njust something that happened to suit the cavemen. And the same is true of any\nclaims that we would be better off without it: The possibility that it was the\ncavewomen who once ruled the roost is neither here nor there.\n\nBut why can\u2019t there be a more innocent motivation for research into human\norigins? Might our interest in the distant past of our species simply be part\nof a more general human curiosity about the origins of everything? Is there\nsomething equally suspect about physicists researching the so-called Big Bang\njust because that question is weighted with religious significance? Or about\npaleontologists wondering about how the dinosaurs died out? Can\u2019t our claims\nabout human origins be as careful, restrained and, indeed, objective, as these\nother inquiries can be at their best? Geroulanos evidently believes not, but\nhe says far too little to persuade anyone who doesn\u2019t already share his\nskepticism.\n\nArguments will not stop us being curious about our origins as a species. Nor\nshould they. When the French painter Paul Gauguin titled his grandest work\n\u201cWhere Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?\u201d, he was not simply\nasking three distinct questions. He was suggesting that questions about our\npresent and future require a truthful picture of our past, a past that\nincludes but isn\u2019t limited to our prehistoric past. Perhaps the impulses that\nanimate this insatiable curiosity are the same ones that send adoptees and the\ndonor-conceived on quests to find their biological parents. They can seek this\nknowledge without supposing that their genetic inheritance is the only one\nthat counts.\n\nYet, as those analogies themselves show, our natural curiosity is almost\nuniquely vulnerable to the usual enemies of truth: wishful thinking, delusion,\nfantasy. But fantasy is best corrected in the usual scientific way. We test\nour hypotheses to distinguish the true from the merely convenient or\nflattering. The real lesson of Geroulanos\u2019s stimulating, provoking history is\nnot skepticism, but humility.\n\nMy FP: Follow topics and authors to get straight to what you like.
