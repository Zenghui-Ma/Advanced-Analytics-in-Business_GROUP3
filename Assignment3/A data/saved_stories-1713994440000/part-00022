Once inside, my hands press flat and sticky against my US passport,\nGerman residency title and COVID-19 vaccine card. The doctor\u2019s cobalt eyes\nsquint beneath her mask, forming deep frown lines as she peers in suspended\nbewilderment, muttering at my documents. I ask her to clarify.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re a Buchleitner and not a native German speaker?!\u2019 Her astonishment and\ndisgust flood me with shame.\n\nWhat does it mean to return to a land you are supposed to belong to as a\ndescendant but in which you are functionally a foreigner?\n\nMisspelled on my birth certificate with a visible strikethrough, my German\nfamily name always proved difficult for Americans, making me an easy target\nfor school-playground bullying and assumptions about my nationality that left\nme feeling alien. Absent any accompanying grandparents\u2019 memories, recipes,\ncustoms or folklore, it remained a phantom identifier with a disembodied\nlineage.\n\nBy divine miracle or sheer coincidence, two months after my first trip to\nGermany in 2009, where I had a premonition while perched on Heidelberg\u2019s arch\nbridge that I would return, a distant relative contacted my father with news\nthat felt almost like a premonition: she had painstakingly documented the\nBuchleitner genealogy from 1520 onward, chronicling the emigration of four\nsets of ancestors from Saarbr\u00fccken to Pennsylvania in the mid-1800s, offering\nanswers to our missing lineage. Craving religious and political freedom,\navoiding compulsory military service, and overcoming economic hardship were\nreasons enough to make a hellish months-long journey to a departure port and\nthen dodge outbreaks of cholera, typhus and smallpox in steerage-class ship\naccommodations.\n\nWhen I was leaving Germany, it had seemed as if my ancestors were beckoning me\nto return. But that wouldn\u2019t happen for another decade, after I became a\nfinalist for the Robert Bosch Foundation Fellowship and fell in love with a\nGerman man I\u2019d met in the Temple of the Reclining Buddha in Bangkok. In 2019,\nI stuffed my keepsakes into three zip-tied suitcases and, though I had no\ngrasp of the German language at all, decided I was migrating to Munich\nindefinitely.\n\nWith a perception of Germany as a methodical, organised utopia to emulate, I\nassumed my integration would come naturally due to my lineage and new\nrelationship, sooner rather than later granting me an identity to match my\nname. Within months, however, the assimilation challenges boiled me down to a\nflicker. Everyday moments of pretending I understood a store clerk\u2019s questions\nwhile flanked by impatient customers proved daunting. When strangers barked\norders at crosswalks, I awkwardly smiled and nodded. A deep purgatory of\nstraddling an ancestral place that labelled me Ausl\u00e4nderin (foreigner)\namassed. \u2018Buchleitner\u2019 became something to justify everywhere names matter:\nfrom my Frauen\u00e4rtzin\u2019s (gynecologist\u2019s) office to the B\u00fcrgerb\u00fcro (citizen\u2019s\noffice) to airport passport control, producing confusion. Everyone wanted to\nknow how an American, sans German husband, sans emigrated German parents, Oma\nor Opa, could possess such a name.\n\nI am not alone in my quest to belong somewhere. In the book Birchland: A\nJourney Home to Norway (1939), Joran Birkeland, the US-born daughter of\nNorwegian parents, chronicles her return to Norway to discover her roots, sent\nby an irresistible urge. At the time, it was a highly publicised\nrepresentation of our American (and human) will to pilgrimage to ancestral\nhomelands. Nested on territories taken from Native Americans, inhabitants of\nNorth America today often feel like a collection of refugees and migrants\nunited in missing our origin, thrown into a melting pot and dizzied by our\nembodiment of multiple lineage ties.\n\nThe rise of consumer DNA testing companies indicates that Americans grapple\nwith a sense of alienation from their roots. As of 2019, more than 26 million\nconsumers had added their DNA to four leading commercial ancestry and health\ndatabases, according to MIT Technology Review. About one in seven US adults\nreport having used a mail-in DNA testing service from companies such as\nAncestryDNA or 23andMe, according to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center.\nWhen asked about their reasons, the majority (87 per cent) say they wanted to\nlearn more about where their family came from. AncestryDNA even offers\npersonalised travel to testers craving a toe-touch with origin destinations.\nAccording to the researchers Sol\u00e8ne Prince and Aydan Mehtiyeva, a process of\nself-discovery that sometimes includes ancestral tourism is increasingly\nsignificant for those feeling alienated from their roots and hoping to trace\ntheir family lineage. Voyaging to a heritage place is viewed as a form of\naffective sacred pilgrimage or rite of passage, building a larger narrative\nabout one\u2019s past.\n\nWith her young son, the travel journalist Sheeka Sanahori traced her great-\ngrandmother\u2019s journey from Mississippi to Missouri during the Great Migration,\nwhen an estimated 6 million Black Americans left the southern United States\nbetween the 1910s and the \u201970s. Her desire to make the journey began after she\nbecame pregnant and dove into genealogy, scouring public documents and notes\nin a family Bible.\n\n\u2018I always had this idea that I would return ... We\u2019re called here to heal the\nrift from a past generation\u2019\n\n\u2018When the train was moving, I noticed some of the trees were probably still\nthere when my family came through,\u2019 she told me. \u2018I started to pay attention\nto small details, feeling the energy and breathing the air.\u2019\n\nGenealogy tests offer empirical snapshots, but they can\u2019t fully explain one\u2019s\nnuanced pull to an ancestral homeland. While tourism whets tastes and\nexperiences, migration is perhaps the greatest length we will go in our search\nfor identity and belonging. Others I interviewed had various reasons for\nmigrating or solidifying transnational ties to their ancestral homeland,\nperceiving it as a cultural centre.\n\nThe writer Dan Q Dao moved from the US to Saigon in late 2022. His parents\nfled Vietnam as teenage refugees in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War. In his\n2020 essay for Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, he describes being \u2018homesick for a place\n[he] hadn\u2019t yet visited\u2019 as a young child, and the \u2018convoluted topic\u2019 of\nreturning to the homeland on family trips in support of his parents\u2019 non-\nprofit organisation, which builds schools in rural Vietnam. Dao is Vi\u1ec7t Ki\u1ec1u \u2013\na phrase referring to \u2018Vietnamese sojourners\u2019, a person of Vietnamese descent\nwho was born or lives overseas. He has since discovered a local community of\nothers with similar ties.\n\n\u2018I always had this idea that I would return,\u2019 he told me. \u2018I felt out of place\nmy entire life. Most of us were used to perceiving the country in the shadow\nof our parents. Once we met each other and socialised, we broke barriers.\nWe\u2019re called here to heal the rift from a past generation. I also found\ncomfort in witnessing Saigon\u2019s thriving, powerful queer community. Vietnam is\na mystical place.\u2019\n\nThe performing artist James Monroe \u0160tevko theorises that Americans return to\nancestral places because they lack a sense of community or belonging. \u2018People\nlove storytelling,\u2019 he told me. \u2018They want stories about themselves. Americans\nneed that. We are looking for our history. All human history has been about\nstories passed down from generation to generation. That is perhaps what\ncompels me to search for information.\u2019\n\n\u0160tevko found his great-grandfather\u2019s military draft card in a photo album and\ntraced him to Rov\u0148any, Slovakia. He then evolved his transnational identity by\nmaking two heritage pilgrimages to Slovakia to dive deep into local culture,\ntook a 10-week intensive Slovak language course, attended events, and applied\nfor ancestral citizenship, which required on-the-ground investigation into his\nfamily background.\n\n\u2018At a ski resort, a local woman wrote on paper that she granted me my\ncitizenship,\u2019 he told me. \u2018People are very welcoming to me due to my lineage\nand have helped me in countless ways uncover more.\u2019\n\nDespite blending in with her name and appearance while abroad in Tokyo, the\nsociologist Jane Yamashiro felt like a cultural foreigner at times, prompting\nher to pursue studies into the meaning of \u2018Japaneseness\u2019. Between 2004 and\n2015, she chronicled ethnographic fieldwork in the greater Tokyo area,\ninterviews in both Japan and the US (mainland and Hawaii), and other research\nin her book Redefining Japaneseness: Japanese Americans in the Ancestral\nHomeland (2017) to understand the \u2018further complications that arise when you\ngo \u201cwhere you\u2019re from\u201d\u2019.\n\nMigration research is heavily centred on diasporas \u2013 migrants and descendants\nof migrants, whose identity and sense of belonging have been shaped by their\nexperience or background. The concept is historically linked to Jewish,\nArmenian and Kurdish populations dispersed worldwide with limited access to a\nplace of origin and often accompanied by an idealised collective memory about\nthe ancestral homeland or at least the ancestral experience, a sense of\nkinship and robust group consciousness. When a person migrates back to an\nancestral homeland, they are often assumed to identify via a diaspora group.\nWhat, then, can explain those who don\u2019t come from diasporas, including myself\nand some others I interviewed?\n\nTo avoid the sometimes negative or pejorative connotations she found in the\nterms \u2018ethnic return migration\u2019, \u2018diasporic return\u2019, or other academic terms,\nYamashiro conceptualised ancestral homeland migration \u2013 the movement of global\nco-ethnics to their ancestral homeland regardless of their identification with\nit. While it describes Japanese American migrants from her research, the idea\nhas universal implications.\n\n\u2018My concept of ancestral homeland migration starts from a more neutral place.\nThere\u2019s an ancestral connection, and this person is raised, often even born,\noutside of this ancestral homeland. They\u2019re migrating to this place where they\nhave this ancestral connection. Now, let\u2019s start there and see what else there\nis. I don\u2019t want to make assumptions about individuals or groups other than\nstarting with some empirical facts,\u2019 Yamashiro explained to me.\n\nPeople often expect the ancestral homeland to complete missing pieces of their\nidentity. I know I did\n\nFrom her observations, Japanese American migrants in Tokyo are often perceived\nas \u2018returning\u2019, masking the underlying complexities. People of Japanese\nancestry developed different communities, identities and forms of culture\nworldwide, including between the mainland US and Hawaii, where \u2018Japanese\u2019\ntakes on different meanings: in Hawaii \u2013 where Japan has a mainstream\nassociation \u2013 they enjoy a higher status, while in the mainland US they\ncontend with lower social positions, minority status and racism, which are\nsimilarly reflected in their experiences in Japan.\n\nYamashiro says those offshoots are part of a global ancestral group, her term\nfor a population with shared ancestral ties that has dispersed across multiple\nsocieties and nation-states, including people both oriented and not oriented\ntoward the ancestral homeland, with diaspora and non-diaspora experiences, who\nare historically and culturally linked despite diverse histories and local\nidentities. Since \u2018Japanese\u2019 varies in meaning from place to place,\nYamashiro\u2019s term is not meant to be homogeneous but rather one that\nencapsulates these variations while recognising their common ancestral link.\nGlobal ancestral groups are composed of branches, with the ancestral homeland\nas one of many, decentring it as the \u2018contemporary cultural centre\u2019 while\nstill recognising its critical role. \u2018If the ancestral homeland is seen as the\nauthentic cultural centre, then populations outside of it will always be seen\nas inauthentic, lacking, and diluted,\u2019 writes Yamashiro.\n\nPeople often migrate expecting the ancestral homeland to complete missing\npieces of their identity. I know I did. Perhaps what is most remarkable about\nYamashiro\u2019s research, which I and others experienced, is the discovery that\nthe ancestral homeland is not always the arbiter of culture, nor is it always\nthe vessel to replenish what we think we may be missing. Many of her\ninterviewees learned to \u2018feel less Japanese\u2019 due to their language abilities\nand reduced cultural fluency. Their migration did not always reaffirm identity\nas expected.\n\nDespite being born and raised in San Diego, Kevin, a young man from her\nresearch, is perceived as foreign by Americans due to his East Asian\nappearance. To Yamashiro, he recalled a serendipitous moment of sitting on a\ntrain and blending in with other passengers. Eventually, however, he found his\nlack of language fluency, body language and use of chopsticks set him apart.\nSimilarly, since Japanese Americans experience racial discrimination in the\ncontinental US, moving to the ancestral homeland is an attempt to find a place\nwhere they can blend. Yet those of h\u0101fu or mixed ancestry also reported it was\ndifficult for the Japanese to acknowledge their shared ties.\n\n\u2018Experiences in the United States and expectations before going to the\nancestral homeland shape experiences in the homeland because they highlight\nthings they\u2019re not expecting,\u2019 Yamashiro told me. \u2018So regarding phenotype,\nwhen people look different from the majority in the United States and expect\nto go to Japan and fit in, it stands out to them how they\u2019re not accepted.\nThen, they must negotiate that and realise they need to learn the language to\nfit in better. They need to think about how they dress, their body language,\nand other things that we\u2019re not usually thinking about when we think about\nromantic ideas of the ancestral homeland where all people of our ancestry will\nbe accepted.\u2019\n\nYamashiro\u2019s interviewees came to redefine Japaneseness as \u2018a form ... which\ndoes not fully include them\u2019. Instead, they constructed true transnational\nidentities \u2013 a better understanding of contemporary Japanese society while\nremaining connected to their American cultural framework and embodiment.\n\nDoes our mere blood make us something? Does mine make me German? Does James\u2019s\nblood make him Slovak, or is there more to this equation?\n\nStephen Cho Suh, an assistant professor of Asian American studies at San Diego\nState University, examined Yamashiro\u2019s approach in a paper discussing his own\n2010-19 study. In that work, Suh conducted 57 in-depth interviews with Korean\nAmerican \u2018returnees\u2019, mostly people who had lived in South Korea for a median\nstay of five years. The study tapped what scholar Ji-Yeon O Jo calls \u2018imagined\naffective connection\u2019 in her book Homing: An Affective Topography of Ethnic\nKorean Return Migration (2017), which investigates the experiences and degrees\nof belonging of legacy migrants \u2013 later-generation diaspora Koreans who\n\u2018return\u2019 to South Korea with no first-hand experience, possessing only\ninherited memories, stories, pictures, and family traditions and community, or\nknowledge gained through media. How much of that connection was actual, and\nhow much of it had been imagined, created in their minds alone?\n\nAfter doing the interviews, Suh realised the migrants, who may not explicitly\narticulate being a member of a larger diaspora, envisioned their migration as\na return to the ancestral centre despite being cultural foreigners. He\nidentifies three categories of orientation:\n\n  * Bio-explicit individuals who \u2018(re)connect with a strictly primordial or biologised rendition of Korean ethnicity as one of their primary motivating factors for migrating\u2019, confident that they shared indisputable \u2018blood\u2019 ties with local South Korean people.\n  * Those with a culture-explicit \u2018return\u2019 orientation, who reaffirm their ties to an abstracted Korean culture perceived via secondary sources. \u2018Korea was thus simply an ideation for most respondents; an amalgamation of anecdotes, ideas, and memories that brought about feelings of positive affect such as nostalgia and comfort,\u2019 writes Suh.\n  * Finally, Suh refers to those with ambivalent orientations, who migrated not because of perceived biological or cultural ties but by other connections. Still, they possessed and articulated an imagined affective connection with South Korea.\n\nHis findings reveal that identities shifted as time went on. Most considered\nSouth Korea \u2018the arbiter of Korean-ness\u2019 and viewed their migration as a\nmeaningful way to reconnect with their Korean \u2018roots\u2019 and relatives or\nreaffirm culture. Still, their returns were, as Suh put it, \u2018far from\nidyllic\u2019. They lacked recognition as full members of South Korean civil\nsociety and \u2018national polity\u2019. They faced significant structural and cultural\nbarriers in workplaces, public spaces, and within extended family, producing\n\u2018identity dissonance\u2019 \u2013 reality clashing with their upbringings and\nexpectations, causing them to question long-held notions. One second-\ngeneration Korean American, Sam, actively avoided identifying as Korean post-\nmigration, saying \u2018Korean American\u2019 instead.\n\n\u2018Korean Americans, especially those raised in the US, have very different\nexperiences, identities, and world views from those raised in Korea,\u2019 Suh told\nme. \u2018Legally, they\u2019re also not South Korean in most cases ... they\u2019re Korean\nby name only ... and so politically and culturally, they quickly realise\nthere\u2019s more to being Korean than simply being of shared ancestry. They begin\nto see themselves as either American or Korean American. That term, for many\nof these individuals before migration, is fraught with a kind of ambivalence\nbecause most Asians in the context of the US will refer to themselves by their\nethnicity, nationality, or race: Korean or Asian. For the first time, they are\nthe gatekeepers to Americanness within the context of Korea, more so perhaps\nthan other American expats. We begin to see the kind of renegotiation of what\nit means to be American within the context of South Korea, ironically.\u2019\n\nIn 1954, the Canadian anthropologist Kalervo Oberg first presented culture\nshock: a model of cultural adjustment, still prevalent today. In it, the\nmigrant wafts into a honeymoon experience where the new country\u2019s sights,\nsounds and food enchant them. Then, \u2018negotiation\u2019, a phase where the suspended\ninterregnum of place and identity causes reality to clamp down and cultural\nbarriers to arise, is described well by the Spanish language term zozobra, an\nanxious inability to be at home in the world. Its meaning is universal.\nPicture yourself standing on a paddle board in choppy water where your feet\nwobble beneath you as you struggle not to capsize. An \u2018[incessant oscillation]\nbetween two possibilities, between two effects, without knowing which one to\ndepend on ... in this to and fro the soul suffers, it feels torn and wounded,\u2019\nper the philosopher Emilio Uranga. This phase also produces demoralisation, a\npsycho-spiritual crisis associated with the breakdown of one\u2019s cognitive map,\nwhere the assumptions that grounded you before lose all credibility, leaving\nyou utterly confused.\n\nDuring a Hatsuhinode New Year\u2019s ritual in Japan in 2019, German man dropped to\none knee with glistening eyes and asked me to be his wife. Saying yes birthed\na palpable tornness since Germany would become my country indefinitely, and\nI\u2019d been struggling to integrate, despite the perception that, due to blood\nties and my name, I could belong. In the months following our engagement, my\nintensive language course in Munich and its stiff wood chairs became a dreaded\nchore. COVID-19\u2019s ravenous descent ground life into a quarantined, stagnant\npressure cooker, adding a topsy-turvy macro backdrop to my existing confusion.\nAs European borders shuttered, an ever-growing precipice between our\npersonalities emerged, and by September 2021, after the second mandated\nCOVID-19 lockdown, the relationship was done. My only anchor in Germany sunk,\nI found myself a remote vessel bobbing in unsettled waters.\n\nIn the beginning of that period, I lay on the cold bathroom floor of my new\nflat, drawing deep slow breaths to stave off anxiety. Anxious to build more\ncommunity in my new aloneness, I reached out to other expats. Although welcome\ncompany, they could not understand the purgatory of my experience in an\nancestral place because they lacked deeper ties to Germany. Similar to\nYamashiro\u2019s and Suh\u2019s interviewees, these experiences further enhanced my\nforeignness to the point that I contemplated shedding \u2018Buchleitner\u2019 for\nanother non-German identifier.\n\nDespite recent global migration headlines, according to the 2022 United\nNations World Migration Report, most people continue to live in their birth\ncountries \u2013 one in 30 are migrants. As of 2020, around 3.6 per cent of the\nglobal population, 281 million international migrants, were on the move.\nEurope is currently the largest destination, with 87 million, followed by 86\nmillion in Asia. How many of them have the privilege to voluntarily return to\nan ancestral homeland? Locating data on ancestral homeland migrants is\nchallenging because it does not fit more specific categories of tracked\nmigration by governments and NGOs examining refugees, internally displaced\npersons, remittances, or return migrants. More than 50 countries offer\npathways to citizenship by descent, with 25 inside the European Economic Area\noffering EU citizenship to grandchildren, great-grandchildren or distant\ndescendants of European citizens. I consulted Eurostat, the statistical office\nof the European Union, to uncover data on ancestral citizenships requested in\nthe EU, which could signal an intention to migrate to an ancestral homeland. A\nspokesperson told me no specific data on citizenship through ancestry for non-\nEU nationals is available.\n\nOften referred to as \u2018Global North\u2019 or lifestyle migrants, Americans and other\nrelatively affluent individuals are moving primarily for quality of life \u2013 for\ninstance, starting anew, or achieving goals. This contrasts with economic\nrefugees, fleeing persecution, the climate crisis, gang violence, and war. I,\nmy interviewees, and those in Suh\u2019s and Yamashiro\u2019s studies are somewhat\nprivileged in our migration because we could pull the plug on our experiences\nif they become too much to bear.\n\nThe ancestral homeland shakes us, deconstructs us, and cracks us open,\nushering in new resilience\n\n\u2018Relatively well-off citizens of North America and Western Europe are often\nassumed to have the privilege and options to relocate elsewhere, typically\n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d and for a mix of economic or social/cultural/lifestyle reasons,\nas opposed to being \u201cpushed\u201d out by factors like war, revolution, or\nviolence,\u2019 and thus are not \u2018fully considered as part of an identifiable\n\u201cemigration flow\u201d\u2019 in social research, Helen Marrow of Tufts University\nexplained in a brief prepared for me. Marrow and Amanda Klekowski von\nKoppenfels of the University of Kent have conducted two surveys on such\ngroups, but say a much deeper dive is called for in years to come.\n\nOne question lingering for me is whether ancestral homeland migration is\npowered by inherited recollections. Could my own 2009 premonition have come\nfrom my genetics? Biological experiments reveal that lifetime events or\nenvironmental factors can change DNA expression without changing the DNA\nsequence via the epigenome \u2013 chemical compounds and proteins that attach to\nand \u2018mark\u2019 DNA by telling it what to do, controlling the production of\nproteins in particular cells, enabling an organism to adapt.\n\nBut the experts don\u2019t feel that holds much weight when it comes to episodic\nmemory in humans. Recent findings apply to simple organisms, as evidenced in a\nstudy published in Nature Neuroscience in 2013 where mice passed a scent\naversion to their descendants, and the 2016 discovery, from Oded Rechavi\u2019s\nLab, that acquired traits in Caenorhabditis elegans worms can be inherited\nbeyond DNA via small RNA molecules that tune survival at certain temperatures,\nor resistance to certain pathogens. But while you can transmit general\ntendencies such as hypersensitivity to a toxin, Rechavi told me in an\ninterview, \u2018we would not remember a book just because our parents read it. We\ndon\u2019t have a mechanism to transmit specific elaborate memories about arbitrary\nthings we experience in our lives.\u2019\n\nInstead, Rechavi suggests that cultural memory, similar to the imagined\naffective connection mentioned in Jo\u2019s book and Suh\u2019s study, can be more\ninfluential than biology. It is the stories of our heritage, passed down\nthrough the generations, that can colour our experiences, creating a\n\u2018mystique\u2019.\n\nPerhaps all the floods, triumphs, plagues, droughts, and manmade borders drawn\nby power-shuffled empires through the centuries my ancestors survived echo in\nmy migration experience during the COVID-19 crisis and the Russian invasion of\nUkraine. As I write, half of my things are in Germany and the other half in\nthe US; a metaphor for who I am \u2013 an American migrant in their homeland. I and\nthe others moved seeking to connect our fragmented pieces, our hands\noutstretched, begging to be nourished with who we are. Instead, the ancestral\nhomeland shakes us, deconstructs us, and cracks us open, ushering in new\nresilience and perspective.\n\nIn the apartment that became my refuge, a nest, I write my final chapter of\nGermany in real time: the story of a solo woman abroad in her lineage country,\nwho emerged to embody the community by cofounding a 3,900-member advocacy\ngroup for other skilled migrants, leading collaborations with policymakers,\nincluding Munich\u2019s migration advisory council (Migrationsbeirat). My resolve\nis now airtight, but my perception of our identities as transnational mosaics\nis forever fluid.\n\nThe author received funding from an International Center for Journalists 2023\nNews Corp Media Fellowship, which made possible the reporting in this essay.\n\nDemography and migrationHomeGenetics\n\n23 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nEconomic history\n\nCredit card nation\n\nAmericans have always borrowed, but how exactly did their lives become so\nentangled with the power of plastic cards?\n\nSean H Vanatta\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHuman rights and justice\n\nMy elusive pain\n\nThe lives of North Africans in France are shaped by a harrowing struggle to\nbelong, marked by postcolonial trauma\n\nFarah Abdessamad\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nNeuroscience\n\nHow to make a map of smell\n\nWe can split light by a prism, sounds by tones, but surely the world of odour\nis too complex and personal?
