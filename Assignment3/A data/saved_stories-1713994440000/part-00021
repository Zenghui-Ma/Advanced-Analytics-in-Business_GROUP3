The flaws could\nallow authenticated attackers to execute commands as root on the underlying\noperating system, one of them already has proof-of-concept exploit code\navailable publicly.\n\nThe two vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-20295 and CVE-2024-20356, are\nrated 8.8 and 8.7 in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) which\nequates to high severity. Both can be exploited over the network if the IMC\ninterfaces are remotely accessible, but the reason why they\u2019re not rated\ncritical is because the attackers need to be authenticated and have some\nprivileges already.\n\nThe Cisco IMC is a baseband management controller (BMC), a dedicated processor\nthat\u2019s usually included in servers and runs specialized software that allows\nthe remote monitoring and management of a system\u2019s hardware even when its main\noperating system is shut down. Because BMCs often have dedicated CPU, memory,\nnetwork ports and even their own operating system, they\u2019re often described as\nsmall computers running inside bigger computers.\n\n\u201cThe Cisco IMC enables system management in the data center and across\ndistributed branch-office locations,\u201d the Cisco documentation reads. \u201cIt\nsupports multiple management interfaces, including a Web User Interface (Web\nUI), a Command-Line Interface (CLI), and an XML API that is consistent with\nthe one used by Cisco UCS Manager.\u201d\n\nThe IMC is present in a variety of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS)\nservers, as well as in specific Cisco appliances based on those servers. The\ntwo vulnerabilities are present in different IMC interfaces.\n\n## Insufficient input validation\n\nThe CVE-2024-20295 flaw is in the IMC CLI and stems from insufficient\nvalidation of user-supplied input. An attacker with read-only or higher\nprivileges on an affected device and with access to the IMC CLI can inject\ncommands that will be executed with root privileges.\n\nThe vulnerability impacts the Cisco 5000 Series Enterprise Network Compute\nSystems (ENCS), Catalyst 8300 Series Edge uCPE, UCS C-Series Rack Servers in\nstandalone mode and UCS E-Series Servers in default configurations. Many other\nproducts and appliances that are based on UCS C-Series servers are also\naffected if the IMC CLI was explicitly configured to be accessible \u2014 IMC is\nnot exposed by default on these devices.\n\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware of public\nproof-of-concept code being available for this vulnerability but has not seen\nmalicious exploitation in the wild.\n\nThe second vulnerability, CVE-2024-20356, is located in the web-based\nmanagement interface of Cisco IMC and can be exploited by attackers that have\nadministrator-level privileges through specially crafted commands.\n\nThe flaw impacts Cisco 5000 Series Enterprise Network Compute Systems (ENCS),\nCatalyst 8300 Series Edge uCPE, UCS C-Series M5, M6, and M7 Rack Servers in\nstandalone mode, UCS E-Series Servers and UCS S-Series Storage Servers in\nstandalone mode. Similarly to the previous vulnerability, appliances based on\nUCS C-Series servers are also impacted if their default configurations were\nchanged in order to expose the IMC user interface.\n\nMost server manufacturers have their own BMC implementations and these\ncontrollers and their software have a history of serious vulnerabilities.\nSophisticated attackers, including APT groups, have even created malware\nimplants targeting these interfaces.\n\n## Bypassing SNMP restrictions in IOS and IOS XE\n\nCisco also patched a medium-risk vulnerability, CVE-2024-20373, in its IOS and\nIOS XE Software which is used on many of its enterprise switches and routers.\nThe flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass the Access Control List\n(ACL) feature for simple network management protocol (SNMP) in certain cases.\nSNMP is a protocol that allows devices to expose information about their\nconfigurations and to make modifications to those settings over the network.\n\n\u201cThis vulnerability exists because Cisco IOS software and Cisco IOS XE\nsoftware do not support extended IPv4 ACLs for SNMP, but they do allow\nadministrators to configure extended named IPv4 ACLs that are attached to the\nSNMP server configuration without a warning message,\u201d Cisco explains in its\nadvisory. \u201cThis can result in no ACL being applied to the SNMP listening\nprocess.\u201d\n\n## Related content\n\n  * news\n\n#### New OT security service can help secure against critical systems attacks\n\nCritical Start\u2019s new offering is designed to handle security teams with\nspecialized detection and response tooling for operational technology systems.\n\nBy Shweta Sharma\n\nApr 24, 2024 3 mins\n\nSecurity Software\n\n  * feature\n\n#### What is biometrics? 10 physical and behavioral identifiers that can be\nused for authentication\n\nBiometrics has the potential to make authentication dramatically faster,\neasier and more secure than traditional passwords, but companies need to be\ncareful about the biometric data they collect.\n\nBy Maria Korolov\n\nApr 24, 2024 14 mins\n\nBiometrics Authentication Security\n\n  * feature\n\n#### The rise in CISO job dissatisfaction \u2013 what\u2019s wrong and how can it be\nfixed?\n\nFrustration, stress, and increased liability are only a few of the off-putting\nrealities giving CISOs cold feet.
