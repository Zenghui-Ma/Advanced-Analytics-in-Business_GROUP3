This includes all 600 developers at Bolt who also use\nNode.JS.\n\nTo answer why, let me dive into our engineering philosophy.\n\nAt Bolt, we believe technology is a tool to solve business problems. While\nthis may not sound glamorous to engineers, our operational efficiency has been\ncritical to our success. Therefore, it\u2019s important to consider business needs\nwhen tackling technical issues. In fact, some problems can be resolved\nmanually without the use of technology.\n\nOur team abides by the \u201cone way of doing things\u201d principle, which entails\nutilising the same tool for a set of issues as much as feasible. So, for\nexample, we use Node.JS with TypeScript entirely for the backend. However, we\nmake exceptions for specialised and predominantly computation-intensive tasks.\n\nWithout further ado, I\u2019ll explain why this approach is helping us achieve high\nefficiency.\n\n## It\u2019s lightweight\n\nBolt utilises a microservices approach, with over 1000 distinct services\ncurrently in operation (as of the time of writing). These services run\nmultiple instances in various AWS availability zones, enabling us to operate\nat a significant scale.\n\nThe services are mostly occupied with handling API requests, managing\ndifferent events, and executing scheduled tasks.\n\nThe rationale behind conducting business operations is usually simple. It\nentails examining \u201cif\u201d statements, accessing other services, and retrieving\ninformation from the database. These duties do not require a bulky JVM with an\nexcessive amount of RAM.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of using Node.JS is its lightweight nature. With\njust one EC2 machine, multiple Node.JS processes can be supported. In fact, we\ncurrently have machines running up to 40 different Node.JS microservices.\n\nOne crucial aspect of being lightweight is its cost-saving benefits on AWS\nexpenses. Although it may not sound exciting from an engineering standpoint,\nit\u2019s a fundamental factor in terms of business profitability.\n\n## It\u2019s single-threaded\n\nWhen it comes to creating high-load systems, concurrency can be a major\nchallenge. However, Node.JS is designed to be single-threaded during\nexecution, eliminating many of the concurrency problems. This means that\nthreads, monitors, and fork-join pools are no longer necessary and can be\nforgotten.\n\nIn the past, requests were handled using separate threads or processes that\nconsumed a lot of resources. However, with Node.JS, all requests are stored in\nan event loop and are put on hold during async calls. This means that requests\nwon\u2019t take up processor time while they\u2019re waiting.\n\nWhen dealing with DB and external services, concurrency issues still need to\nbe managed. However, the use of an event loop can make the code more\nstreamlined and readable.\n\nIt may seem that a service that can only handle one request at a time would\nnot be able to manage a large number of requests. However, it\u2019s important to\nnote that most business services are not very resource-intensive, and the\ndatabase typically handles most of the workload. Even at our current level,\nwhere we receive hundreds of requests per second, most services can still\nmanage the load on a single instance (though it\u2019s not advisable to rely on\nonly one process running).\n\nThere is a drawback to consider. It\u2019s important to be cautious with the event\nloop since there is only one execution thread. Whenever a function takes a\nlong time to run, other requests will be put on hold, and this can quickly\nlead to a snowball effect.\n\n## Want to read the full article?
