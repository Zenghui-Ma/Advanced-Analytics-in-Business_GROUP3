In this post, we\u2019ll discuss the most important\nbutton in the app, the run button.\n\nThe Pickcode \"run\" button\n\n## The programming workflow\n\nWhile programming in a code editor, the main workflow is:\n\n  1. Identify your goal. Complete a tutorial, make a bar chart, create a game, etc.\n  2. Write some code\n  3. Test that code by running it\n  4. Did it do what you wanted? If not, go back to step 2.\n\n\u201cRunning code\u201d makes your code editor take what you\u2019ve written and give it to\nthe programming language you\u2019re working with for evaluation. In simpler terms,\n\u201cit makes the computer do the thing\u201d. For a language like Python, when you\n\u201crun\u201d the follwing code, you will see the numbers 10 and 18 appear on your\nscreen.\n\nprint(5 + 5) print(2 * 9)\n\nIf the goal of your program was to show the numbers 10 and 18 on your screen\nusing basic arithmetic, nice! You\u2019re all done. If your goal was to show the\nnumbers 10 and 20, it\u2019s back to the drawing board.\n\n## Designing for this workflow\n\nGiven the key workflow in question, it is important to optimize the user\nexperience of an editor to facilitate the easy writing and running of code. It\nis also important to consider the intended audience.\n\nFor professional developers, there are quite a few other aspects to the\nsoftware engineering workflow, including source control, debugging, linting,\nor running custom commands via a full terminal. For novices, I would argue\nthat 99% of time is spent on viewing tutorial instructions, writing code, and\nrunning it. Probably with the mouse. (More on that later). So, button\nplacement is mission critical.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of our Python editor\n\nThe Pickcode Editor\n\nThe size and placement of our run button are guided by Fitts's law. From\nWikipedia:\n\nThe law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a\nfunction of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the\ntarget... Placing layout elements on the four edges of the screen allows for\ninfinitely large targets in one dimension and therefore presents ideal\nscenarios.\n\nNext, here\u2019s a screenshot of running the same program in VS Code, a very\npopular editor for professionals. Can you find the run button?\n\nEditing Python code in VS Code\n\nThere\u2019s more going on in the VS Code window. That\u2019s because VS Code is for\nprofessionals, who need powerful tools to get their job done.\n\n(Quick aside on keyboard shortcuts: I doubt anyone clicks half the buttons in\nVS Code. They use the keyboard. Keyboard shortcuts are awesome and are\nprobably the single most efficient way to get through the code editing\nworkflow. For absolute novices, I think it\u2019s inappropriate cognitive overload.\nIDLE is a Python editor whose \u201cRun button\u201d is either hidden in a dropdown menu\nor accessed by pressing F5. I have watched novices struggle with this. It\u2019s\ntough.)\n\n## Why does this matter\n\nI would argue that the design of a code editor has a pretty large effect on a\nbeginner\u2019s ability to gain expertise in programming. The Youtube channel\nVeritasium lists the following as a few key aspects of gaining mastery in a\nnew field:\n\n  * Valid environment - Do your actions deterministically affect your achievement of your goals? You can\u2019t gain expertise in playing roulette.\n  * Many repetitions - Can you repeatedly practice the skill in question?\n  * Timely feedback - How fast do you learn whether your last repetition was correct or incorrect?\n\nThe design of the code editor a student uses is important for all three of\nthese aspects of gaining mastery.\n\n  * Valid environment: Code is deterministic. However, if an editor is confusing enough to the learner, it may appear as though it behaves randomly. (See: \u201cCode Doesn\u2019t Happen to You\u201d)\n  * Many repetitions: If it\u2019s easy and obvious how to run code, a student will do it more often.\n  * Timely feedback: Does code execute without delay, showing errors and output clearly?\n\nTo put a finer point on this, the code editor is the environment in which a\nstudent learns, and it facilitates their gaining of mastery, so it\u2019s\nimportant.\n\nWe also have the numbers on this. In the past 2 years, students have clicked\nthe play button on Pickcode 2.5 million times. If the run button was smaller,\nor in the wrong place, or a worse shade of green, I think that number would be\na lot lower. In fact, the number of times the run button is pressed is the\nprimary user metric we follow at Pickcode. Almost all of our decisions in the\nproduct revolve around creating an environment and experiences where students\nclick the run button more often.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe choice of code editor for professionals is a bit of a flame war topic that\nI will 100% not get into. Personally, I use VS Code.\n\nFor middle or high school students, the code editor I recommend is Pickcode.\nThis is the Pickcode blog, after all. If you\u2019re not convinced, the appendix of\nthis post will include anonymous screenshots of a number of other popular code\neditors for novices. Which button would you prefer to click on? And, if you\u2019d\nlike a chance to press our run button, feel free to create a free account and\nwrite some code.\n\n## Appendix: Other Run buttons and the area surrounding them\n\nA run button with too many things nearby!A run button that is a little small,\nand in the top center of the screen.A run button with a large number of other,\nlarger buttons nearbyA vintage run button with some other interesting icons\nnearbyA run button with an interesting labelA fairly iconic run button for\nyounger students (It's from Scratch)A nice huge button with an interesting\nYoutube video nearbyA run button that actually looks better than Pickcode's.\nThis is from Hatch KidsA button that looks an awful lot like a run button, but\nactually opens a Youtube videoA run button with 2 others, approximately smack\ndab in the middle of the screenA run button that is icon-free and all-capsA\nrun button in a horizontal stack of identically sized buttonsA run button with\nsome other stuff nearbyAn 8-bit run button!\n\nThe end.
