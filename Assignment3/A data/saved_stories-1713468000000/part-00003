Climate warming affects the ability of soils\nto provide these ecosystem services, likely posing broad consequences for food\nsecurity and the stability of ecosystems belowground and aboveground. To\npredict and manage these consequences effectively, it is crucial to understand\nhow soil processes respond to rising temperatures.\n\nScientists worldwide have been conducting deep-soil-warming experiments, in\nwhich soil layers are deliberately heated to observe how plants, soils, and\nmicrobes respond. Recently, though, researchers have recognized the importance\nof comparing and integrating findings from these experiments to help reveal\nnew insights.\n\nThe global DeepSoil 2100 network emerged from conversations among soil\nscientists convened in 2020 by one of us (M.W.I.S.) in response to this need\nfor coordination. The network links field and lab researchers, modelers, data\nproviders, and data users, and it provides a platform for sharing practical\nguidance for running field experiments, reporting data, discussing results,\nand exploring data synergies. Its goals include synthesizing results from\nsoil-warming experiments, making these findings more accessible to a broader\nscientific community, and, ultimately, facilitating more informed predictions\nand decisionmaking regarding climate change and strategies for mitigation and\nadaptation.\n\nEarly efforts of the DeepSoil 2100 network involved bringing the research\ncommunity together to share knowledge and expertise and to set the stage for\nfuture research and synthesis. In March 2023, more than 50 researchers from\nover 10 countries gathered for a workshop held at Sorbonne University in\nParis, and a follow-up meeting took place in April 2023 during the European\nGeosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria. Discussions at these\nmeetings centered around emerging areas for synthesis, the goal of learning\nfrom diverse experiments, and questions in need of collaborative\ninvestigation.\n\n### The Need for a Deeper Understanding\n\n> Soils undergo multiple interacting changes as temperatures increase.\n\nSoils undergo multiple interacting changes as temperatures increase. Soil\nmicroorganisms generally become more active, accelerating the decomposition of\nsoil organic matter and, in turn, the release of carbon dioxide (CO_2) into\nthe atmosphere. These changes affect many related soil functions and may\nreinforce climate change. That is, more CO_2 in the atmosphere drives more\ngreenhouse warming, causing soils to release even more CO_2.\n\nOn the other hand, elevated temperatures can enhance plant uptake of carbon\nfrom the atmosphere by increasing photosynthesis, which could help to\ncompensate for warming-induced soil carbon losses. Also, higher temperatures\ncan significantly affect soil moisture and nutrient cycling, which can\npositively or negatively influence plant growth and soil processes.\n\nModel predictions of terrestrial ecosystems\u2019 responses to climate change,\nwhich result from our understanding of changing soil processes and the balance\nbetween soil carbon lost and gained, unfortunately, contain significant\nuncertainties, especially on a global scale [Bradford et al., 2016]. For\ninstance, the land components in Earth system models do not represent microbes\nexplicitly, do not resolve most of the mechanisms controlling soil organic\nmatter decomposition rates, and have poorly defined parameters for many\necosystems and processes.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nIn addition, current model projections often rely on experimental data\ngathered mostly from the top 10 centimeters of soil profiles [Yost and\nHartemink, 2020]. These studies provide insight into how warming affects near-\nsurface soil layers, but they do not capture the complex interactions and\nfeedback mechanisms occurring in deeper soil layers.\n\n> These novel experiments rely on buried cables, infrared heaters, and even\n> natural geothermal heating to warm soils across a wide range of biomes.\n\nDeep soils contain more than half of the global soil organic carbon stock\n[Rumpel and K\u00f6gel-Knabner, 2011; Jackson et al., 2017]. These deeper layers\nare warming as rapidly as near-surface soil layers [Soong et al., 2020], but\nthey have received less attention. In recent years, however, several\nindependent research teams around the world have established deep-soil-warming\nexperiments (Figure 1), typically heating soil deeper than 30 centimeters\nbelow the surface to investigate plant and soil biogeochemistry responses.\nThis approach provides a better representation of the whole complex soil\nsystem by considering all soil layers.\n\nThese novel experiments rely on buried cables, infrared heaters, and even\nnatural geothermal heating to warm soils across a wide range of biomes [Hanson\net al., 2017; O\u2019Gorman et al., 2014], from forests in temperate and tropical\nareas to tundra, peatlands, temperate salt marshes, and subarctic grasslands\n(Figure 1). The efforts are providing new insights into the responses of soil\ncarbon, nutrient cycling, vegetation, and soil microbes to warming throughout\nthe entire soil profile. For example, recent studies have reported higher soil\ncarbon loss under warming in deeper layers than in near-surface soils in\ntemperate and subtropical forests [Soong et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2018].\n\nFig. 1. Deep-soil-warming experiments in the DeepSoil 2100 network are\ndistributed around the world, although currently, all are in the Northern\nHemisphere.

Schmidt, and Avni Malhotra\n\nWhen synthesized, data from these experiments will provide the foundation for\na deeper and more holistic understanding of complex atmosphere-land\ninteractions, thereby enhancing the accuracy of predictions of how terrestrial\necosystems under different management will react to climate change.\n\n### A Global Database and Emerging Areas for Synthesis\n\nOne of DeepSoil 2100\u2019s first deliverables will be a database populated with\nobservations from the deep-soil-warming experiments shown in Figure 1 and as\nmany others as possible. These observations include warming-induced shifts in\nsoil carbon stocks, soil respiration, root biomass, soil microbial community\ncomposition, and many other components of the soil ecosystem. Attendees at the\nmeetings in 2023 discussed priorities for the database, which will feature a\nstreamlined data entry pipeline, an adaptable and clear data structure, and an\naccessible interface for users to retrieve data easily.\n\nPriorities for the database also include open accessibility and\ninteroperability with existing soil carbon databases. To optimize\ninteroperability, we are following data models and templates from recent\nsuccessful databases, such as the International Soil Radiocarbon Database\n(ISRAD), the Soils Data Harmonization database (SoDaH), and the International\nSoil Carbon Network (ISCN) database [e.g., Malhotra et al., 2019].\n\n> We can evaluate whether ecosystem processes are acclimating to higher\n> temperatures and compare short- versus long-term soil-warming responses.\n\nSince the meetings, a preliminary database has been created with details about\ncurrent deep-soil-warming experiments, including their locations, warming\napproaches, durations, and depths (including distance from the surface, soil\nhorizons, and rooting density), as well as environmental parameters such as\nclimate, soils, and vegetation. The next step will involve requesting original\ndata from these experiments once a data-sharing agreement is in place.\n\nMeeting attendees also discussed how the new database will facilitate\nsynthesis studies and meta-analyses, model-data comparisons, the merging of\nmodel projections with data to refine predictions, and hypothesis testing\nusing the full array of available deep-soil-warming data (Figure 2). The wide\nrange of ecosystems covered by the experimental data in the database will\nallow scientists to assess global patterns and drivers of soil-warming\nresponses while identifying key differences and similarities among sites.\nFurthermore, given the durations of current deep-soil-warming experiments\u2014more\nthan half have been running for more than a decade\u2014we can evaluate whether\necosystem processes are acclimating to higher temperatures and compare short-\nversus long-term soil-warming responses [e.g., Melillo et al., 2017; Walker et\nal., 2020].\n\nFig. 2. The first major deliverable of the DeepSoil 2100 network will be a\nglobal database gathering observations from existing deep-soil-warming\nexperiments. This database will facilitate synthesis and modeling studies to\naddress several emerging research topics, as well as other activities.

Seasonal and interannual\nvariability in soil moisture and nutrients could be another mechanism to\nconsider. For example, soil respiration and gross primary productivity (the\nrate at which plants capture solar energy during photosynthesis) are\nanticipated to be most sensitive to warming during seasonal transitions from\ndry to wet conditions, likely driven by an increase in nitrogen availability.\n\nSynthesizing global data on deep soils will also be valuable for gaining\ninsights into the dynamics and responses to warming of soil organisms\nresponsible for carbon and nutrient cycling, plant and soil stoichiometry (the\nrelative balance of nutrients and other elements present), and aboveground and\nbelowground carbon inputs. All of these factors combine to influence the\nstability and composition of soil ecosystems, as well as soil fertility for\nplants.\n\nOther synthesis studies may examine depth-explicit responses to warming,\nincluding changes in soil CO_2 production and soil organic carbon stocks, as\nwell as variations in the chemical components of soil organic matter and the\nage distribution of soil carbon through the soil profile. Distinct soil-\nwarming responses with depth are expected to be driven by factors like soil\nmoisture, root density, soil fauna activity, and interactions between soil\norganic matter and soil minerals.\n\nExploring processes in rooting zones compared with those in bulk soils across\nexperimental sites is another rich area for collaborative exploration through\nDeepSoil 2100. Soil substrates and nutrient availabilities differ along soil\nprofiles, and changes in belowground inputs of materials like root exudates\n(compounds released from living root cells) mediate many microbial and soil\nprocesses, potentially influencing long-term warming responses across depths.\nCoordinated field experiments using isotope labeling could complement such\nstudies, for example, to examine how specific carbon and nutrient pools change\nwith warming. Furthermore, controlled-temperature laboratory incubation\nexperiments may be useful to elucidate the processes responsible for the\nwarming-induced changes observed during field observations.\n\n### Calling for Interdisciplinary Deep-Soil Studies and Data\n\n> Gaining a deeper understanding of the effects of climate and climate change\n> on belowground biogeochemistry requires comprehensive interdisciplinary\n> studies.\n\nGaining a deeper understanding of the effects of climate and climate change on\nbelowground biogeochemistry requires comprehensive interdisciplinary studies\ninvolving coordinated sampling at different experimental sites and across soil\ndepths. Participants in the DeepSoil 2100 network pursue research in a range\nof biomes, but several ecosystem types and geographic regions lack\nrepresentation, such as dryland ecosystems and ecosystems in Africa, Oceania,\nand the Southern Hemisphere broadly (Figure 1).\n\nAs a network, we encourage the establishment of new deep-soil-warming\nexperiments, especially in these unrepresented areas, and we provide expertise\nand support to researchers planning such experiments by connecting them with\nscientists involved in established efforts. We also enthusiastically welcome\nrepresentatives of current experimental efforts not already linked to DeepSoil\n2100 to join the network.\n\nInterdisciplinary global collaboration among experimentalists, data\nscientists, and modelers is indispensable. Through such collaboration, we can\npursue comprehensive research, develop standardized protocols for field and\nlab experiments, and achieve major advances in building accurate models to\ngain insights into whole-soil dynamics and how they are changing as the ground\nwarms. Only with these insights can we adequately adapt ecosystem management\nin the future.\n\nChallenges to the future database and synthesis studies may arise because of\ndifferences in data structures and methodologies used across experimental\nsites, but the open dialogue and shared learning facilitated through the\nDeepSoil 2100 network provide opportunities to overcome these obstacles. By\nconsolidating data from multiple experiments into a single standardized\ndatabase, DeepSoil 2100 is promoting data sharing worldwide and facilitating\nmore informed decisionmaking to address the profound impacts of global warming\non soil processes and, by extension, on ecosystems and society.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the in-person and online participants of the DeepSoil 2100 workshop\nheld in Paris in 2023 for their contributions to emerging synthesis topics and\nthe Observatoire des Sciences de l\u2019Univers Ecce Terra for funding.
