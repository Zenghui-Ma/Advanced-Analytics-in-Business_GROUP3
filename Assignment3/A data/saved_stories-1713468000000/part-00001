According to Pew, the share of Americans who\nsay they have \u201ca great deal of confidence\u201d in scientists has fallen (from 39%\nin 2020 to 23% today). The view that science has positively impacted society\nhas also tumbled (from 73% in 2019 to 57% today)\n\nThat is regrettable because as the authors of the new book Third Millennium\nThinking point out, science is about more than creating microwaves, vaccines,\nand other modern-day niceties. It\u2019s the most successful system of knowledge\ngathering and problem-solving in human history.\n\nBig Think recently spoke with the book\u2019s authors: Saul Perlmutter, a physicist\nand 2011 Nobel Laureate; John Campbell, a professor of philosophy at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley; and Robert MacCoun, a social psychologist\nand professor of law at Stanford University.\n\nDuring our conversation, we discussed how the relationship between science and\nthe public has changed, why people need to understand how science works, and\nhow we can bring its practices and frameworks to bear on the challenges we\nface today.\n\nBig Think: How did you three come to collaborate?\n\nPerlmutter: About 10 years ago, I started to realize that people have a hard\ntime making decisions in thoughtful, deliberate ways. It looks completely\ndifferent from what I saw when a bunch of scientists try to make a decision or\nsolve a problem.\n\nI wondered, \u201cWhere do scientists learn these ideas?\u201d We don\u2019t teach them in\nany science course that I know of. They are learned through apprenticeship and\n[professional] osmosis. So, I thought, \u201cWell, maybe we could teach them.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d been in conversation for a while at that point with John, and as a\nphilosopher, I thought he\u2019d be a great person to bring to the table. We looked\naround for someone who could bring in the social psychology side of the story\nand found Rob, who was a professor and also in public policy, which was highly\nrelevant.\n\n## Rebuilding trust in light of an artificial sun\n\nBig Think: How has the relationship between science and the public changed\nrecently?\n\nMacCoun: I came of age in a golden era for science. People granted it enormous\nauthority and respect. [But] as we wrapped the second millennium, some people\nstarted to become disenchanted with science.\n\nThey felt that maybe scientists had too much authority or weren\u2019t representing\nthe views of everybody. Some philosophers and social scientists became\nskeptical of how privilege and power distorted scientific claims. We\u2019ve seen\nit reach a point now where people are willfully choosing to believe things\nthat are contrary to what science shows.\n\nCampbell: I was at a cafe a while ago, and someone came up to me and said,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit outside like that. That\u2019s not the real sun. PG&E\n[Pacific Gas & Electric Company] has replaced it with an artificial sun. It\u2019s\nvery damaging.\u201d\n\nI think people often have this attitude that science today is a kind of magic.\nScientists can do anything. They can replace the sun. They can inject robots\ninto your bloodstream that will make you do whatever they want. The only\nquestion [for them]: Are scientists on our side?\n\nThat\u2019s not a good way to think about it. Everybody should have an entry-level\nunderstanding of how science gets done. Science is not rocket science.\n\nPerlmutter: The loss of trust in science is part of the problem of figuring\nout some way to build a trust economy. What can you base your sense of what is\nand isn\u2019t real on? How can you weave together information that you can trust\nand feel some confidence in?\n\nThose kinds of things are what we hope people will get out of the book: a\nsense of things you can weave together to get a probabilistic sense of trust\nin the world.\n\nIt\u2019s not just science. U.S. citizens are also showing declining levels of\ntrust in government, journalism, and other institutions. This graph shows the\nfalling trust in government from 1958\u20132022. (Credit: Pew Research / Our World\nin Data)\n\n## Consider the opposite\n\nBig Think: Can we dig deeper into how scientists use probabilistic thinking?\n\nPerlmutter: Even when we\u2019re talking about cold, hard facts, you can\u2019t always\nanswer questions with an experiment to get a yes or no answer. [Instead], we\nend up getting a probabilistic answer. There\u2019s a 97% chance that the\nmeasurement is giving you this result, [so] if you did it 100 times, it\u2019ll be\nwrong three of those times. What we do is put together lots of those different\nmeasurements until we build up some confidence.\n\nHowever, partial information can be very powerful. If you always insisted on\nsomething being true or not, you couldn\u2019t even cross the street. Nobody can\nguarantee you that you\u2019ll always cross safely. But the odds are one in a\nmillion you\u2019ll be killed, so you cross.\n\nWe already use [probabilistic thinking]. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t carry it\nthrough to other aspects of our lives where we should be using it.\n\nMacCoun: People shouldn\u2019t be intimidated by the word probabilistic either. You\ndon\u2019t have to do calculations. It can involve just acknowledging shades of\ngray.\n\nI worked for a long time on what we know about countries that liberalize their\ndrug laws and allow commercial sales of recreational drugs. People would\nalways ask, \u201cIs legalization the answer or not?\u201d I\u2019d answer, \u201cWell, the\nevidence is nuanced. There are trade-offs involved and some risks.\u201d But they\nwould always press me, \u201cNo, what do you really think?\u201d\n\n[These things] require us to act like grown-ups and recognize that there\u2019s a\nlot of uncertainty in the world. We still have to act, but we can\u2019t pretend\nthat things are all black and white.\n\nBig Think: How might we more effectively use probabilistic thinking outside of\nscience?\n\nCampbell: One thing we\u2019ve forgotten \u2014 or perhaps never learned \u2014 is how to\nhave debates among ourselves. We think of debates like fencing matches. You\ndrive the other guy into the corner, pin them, and that\u2019s victory. Glory to\nyou!\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking probabilistically, you say, \u201cWell, though I think this is\nright, I admit the possibility that I might be wrong.\u201d You also recognize that\nwe have biases that can contribute to us being fallible. We have to learn\ntechniques for screening these biases the same way scientists need it when\nthey do peer-review. We need that in everyday life.\n\n> It\u2019s not enough to just have these habits of mind; you have to have habits\n> of community, too.\n>\n> Robert MacCoun\n\nMacCoun: One strategy we talk about in the book is called \u201cconsider the\nopposite.\u201d It\u2019s where you simply imagine that the opposite of what you believe\nis true. If you go through the exercise, even quickly, you realize that there\nare reasons why [others might believe it].\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to just have these habits of mind; you have to have habits of\ncommunity, too. You have to put yourself in a community of people who will\nchallenge you in a constructive, friendly way because it\u2019s very hard to catch\nourselves in our bad thinking.\n\nCampbell: I think we need that because, at the moment, we live in a winner-\ntakes-all [culture]. We\u2019re supposed to get fired up about a particular issue\nand then go meet the opposition and face them down. That\u2019s not sustainable. We\njust desperately need to have some kind of platform of general understanding\nin the community about how we go about debating.\n\n## No one gets it right 100% of the time\n\nBig Think: How can the scientific mindset help us be more comfortable with\nbeing wrong?\n\nPerlmutter: The scientist\u2019s model is to present a result, all the things that\ncould be wrong with it, and the probability that it\u2019s right or wrong. That\ngives you a lot of room for saving face because it shows you were calibrated\nand knew what you were doing.\n\nThat\u2019s where your self-respect should come from, and science provides a nice\nway to be a dignified and respected person who still (occasionally) gets\nthings wrong.\n\nCampbell: It\u2019s also important for you to not feel that your identity as a\nperson is invested in the position for which you\u2019re arguing. That makes it\nhumiliating to be wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly obvious when you think about values. We all have to accept\nthat there might be something wrong [with our values] and be open to debate\nand discussion on the topic. Whereas if you feel this is my personality, this\nis who I am, then you can\u2019t let go. You get too invested.\n\nWilliam Thomson, Lord Kelvin, in the 1860s. Kelvin\u2019s research made significant\ncontributions to our understanding of physics and mathematics. He also got\nthings wrong, most famously calculating the age of the Earth to be between\n20\u201340 million years old. However, he showed his calculations, and today, we\nknow he was working with partial information as radioactive decay wouldn\u2019t be\ndiscovered until 1903.

Why?\n\nMacCoun: Part of the arrogance of scientists in the late 20th century was when\nthey started making pronouncements on public policy as if \u2014 because they had a\nmastery of the facts \u2014 their position on the issue was the correct one. But,\nof course, they were also bringing their values into play.\n\nValues are important, and scientists can help us think about them, but it\u2019s\nimportant to recognize that the special authority of science is not that it\nweighs in on what values are correct or not. That\u2019s something citizens have to\ndo for themselves in a free society.\n\nPerlmutter: In fact, we want scientists to help people recognize how to reach\ntheir values and, once they\u2019ve chosen which to prioritize, understand what the\nconstraints are. You want the good experts helping as much as possible on the\nfactual part and good public representatives to be helping to sort out the\nvalues.\n\nCampbell: It\u2019s important to add that we should think of values as uncertain as\nanything else. There\u2019s no reason to think you\u2019re going to get it 100% right.\nWe\u2019re doing our best to patch a picture of what we ought to be striving for.\nThat\u2019s important but also open to debate. It\u2019s not something you can lay down\nand say, \u201cThese things will hold fast forever.\u201d Nothing in human life is like\nthat.\n\n> We have the capability of solving seemingly intractable problems [...]. We\n> have a real, open choice to do something quite positive.\n>\n> Saul Perlmutter\n\nPerlmutter: It\u2019s surprisingly helpful for people to discuss values together.\nJohn, you\u2019ve made the case well that [a lot of] progress has been because\npeople have debated values together and rethought their positions.\n\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to\nyour inbox every Thursday\n\nCampbell: George Orwell started his career as a colonial officer. Then he saw\nwhat was happening to the people who were being colonized. This guy was\nhanged, and he really shouldn\u2019t have been. What happened in that case was\nclearly wrong.\n\nSo we learn and we can teach each other. If I think colonialism is just fine\nand you want to show me why it\u2019s wrong, then a good place to start would be\nwith some vivid examples of where you see things going wrong. If I agree that\nthat\u2019s not okay, then we can walk back from the particular case to general\nmoral principles.\n\nMacCoun: It\u2019s worth noting that the book is not anti-conflict. We recognize\nthat conflicts have played important roles in political and scientific\ndevelopment. It\u2019s just that there are more constructive ways of working\nthrough conflict. A lot of these new techniques of deliberation we talk about\nin the book harness ways for people to acknowledge and champion their values\nbut also hear each other out and explore.\n\nBig Think: Is there a message you\u2019d like to leave our readers with?\n\nPerlmutter: One thing we tried to emphasize is why we think it\u2019s important for\npeople to develop these capabilities together. We live in an interesting time\nin history where people see threats everywhere. But people aren\u2019t as aware of\nour amazing accomplishments. [For instance], we\u2019ve taken the world from one of\nmajority poverty to one where poverty is a much, much smaller segment of the\npopulation.\n\nWe have the capability of solving seemingly intractable problems, like hunger,\nclimate change, or the next pandemic. That\u2019s the reason to put so much effort\ninto this game right now. We have a real, open choice to do something quite\npositive.\n\nTags\n\ncritical thinkingCurrent Eventsproblem solvingsociology\n\nTopics\n\nThe Learning Curve\n\nIn this article\n\ncritical thinkingCurrent Eventsproblem solvingsociology\n\nRelated\n\nHealth\n\nHow patients are using technology to kick-start a healthcare revolution\n\nSusannah Fox, former chief technology officer for the HHS, explains how\ntechnology has empowered us to help fill in the cracks of the healthcare\nsystem.\n\nBusiness\n\n6 \u201csecret sauce\u201d ingredients for empathetic leadership\n\nSam Smith \u2014 founder and former CEO of finnCap Group \u2014 argues that a culture of\nempathy will help superscale any business.\n\nThe Past\n\nThe atomic bomb, exile and a test of brotherly bonds: Robert and Frank\nOppenheimer\n\nA rift in thinking about who should control powerful new technologies sent the\nbrothers on diverging paths.
