Photograph:\nimageBROKER/Alamy\n\nAfter the age of 70, the volunteers took part in standard memory and thinking\ntests and were classified as having either no cognitive impairment, mild\ncognitive impairment or dementia. Of those who had worked in the least\ncognitively challenging jobs, 42% were diagnosed with mild cognitive\nimpairment, compared with only 27% who had worked in the most cognitively\nstimulating roles.\n\nAmong the jobs ranked as most stimulating were teachers and university\nlecturers, according to the study, in Neurology. Some of the least cognitively\ndemanding jobs were those that involved repetitive manual tasks, such as road\nwork, cleaning and delivering the post.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that education has a significant protective effect\nagainst cognitive decline in old age. Part of the reason is that better\neducated people are more likely, and more able, to lead healthier lives. But\neducation also appears to build \u201ccognitive reserve\u201d \u2013 the capacity to\nimprovise and find alternative ways of doing things \u2013 which may help stave off\nmental decline, much as physical exercise delays frailty.\n\nAccording to Trine, higher levels of education accounted for about 60% of the\nprotective effect seen among people who did mentally stimulating jobs. \u201cIt\nmeans that education is very important, but it\u2019s also what you do afterwards:\nit\u2019s how you use your brain when you are working. You are building your\ncognitive reserve at work by being cognitively active,\u201d she said.\n\nNeurological conditions now leading cause of ill-health worldwide, finds study\n\nRead more\n\nThe results suggest that people who spend their working lives in less mentally\nstimulating jobs might benefit from further education and pursuing more\ncognitively challenging pastimes outside work. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you are doomed\nor you are not \u2013 we can empower people for their later cognitive health with\neducation and tasks that are cognitively stimulating,\u201d Trine said.\n\nProf Gill Livingston, professor of the psychiatry of older people at\nUniversity College London, said the findings were in line with other studies\non the impact of work. \u201cIt is not just that more educated people do more\ncognitively stimulating jobs \u2013 they do \u2013 but cognitive stimulation in work\nthrough problem solving and new situations has an effect by itself.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot of cognitive stimulation, as most people work many hours for\nmany years,\u201d she said. But work may not have as big an impact as education,\nshe added, because the brains of children and young adults may change more\nthan those in adults to increase cognitive reserve.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Science\n  * Dementia\n  * Norway\n  * Work & careers\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Hundreds of thousands face being denied revolutionary new dementia drugs in England\n\n5 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### What are the symptoms of dementia and how do you get a diagnosis?\n\n5 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Thousands to be offered blood tests for dementia in UK trial\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Air pollution could be significant cause of dementia \u2013 even for those not predisposed\n\n21 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Early blood test to predict dementia is step closer as biological markers identified\n\n12 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Blood test could revolutionise diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s, experts say\n\n23 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Alcohol misuse and loneliness \u2018increase risk of early-onset dementia\u2019\n\n26 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Inequality leaving 115,000 dementia cases \u2018undiagnosed\u2019 in England\n\n23 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s last novel stands in tribute to his defiance of dementia\n\n22 Oct 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Dementia risk factors pose more danger for ethnic minorities, finds study\n\n11 Oct 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Money\n  * Property\n  * Pensions\n  * Savings\n  * Borrowing\n  * Careers\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
