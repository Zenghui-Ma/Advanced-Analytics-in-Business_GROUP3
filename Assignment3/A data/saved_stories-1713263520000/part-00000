Brown Attorney  \n---  \n  \n  * April 15, 2024\n  * Views: 529\n  * Comments: 1\n\n  \n  \nThe U.S. Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\u201cACPA\u201d) is a federal\nlaw\u2014part of the Lanham Act that deals with trademarks and unfair competition.\nIt says that a person can be liable if he or she registers a domain name that\ncontains another\u2019s distinctive trademark with a bad faith intent to profit\nfrom that mark.\n\nOne issue that has arisen over the years is whether registration that can give\nrise to liability means only the first time the domain name is registered, or\nwhether it applies to the re-registration, e.g., each year when the\nregistration is up for renewal with the registrar. See this case from earlier\nthis year where the court held that renewal was not registration.\n\nThe various federal circuits are split over the issue. At least the Third,\nFourth, and Eleventh Circuits have all concluded that the ordinary meaning of\nthe word \u201cregisters\u201d necessarily includes both the first registration and any\nsubsequent re-registrations. The Ninth Circuit has held that Congress meant\n\u201cregistration\u201d to refer only to the initial registration.\n\nThe Second Circuit does not appear to have weighed in on the question. But a\nrecent district court sitting in the Second Circuit sided with the \u201cre-\nregistration is registration\u201d take from the Third, Fourth and Eleventh\nCircuits.\n\nIn the case of We the Protesters, Inc. v. Sinyangwe, 2024 WL 1195417\n(S.D.N.Y., March 20, 2024), counter-defendant registered the disputed domain\nname in 2015. The issue was whether the re-registration of the disputed domain\nname in 2023 was a registration of a distinctive mark done in bad faith. This\npassage of time was important because it gave the arguably descriptive mark\nMAPPING POLICE VIOLENCE enough time to become distinctive.\n\nConcerning the word \u201cregisters\u201d in the ACPA, the court applied its ordinary\nmeaning, noting that it was not the province of the court to add words to\nstatutes that Congress enacts. \u201cHad Congress wished to restrict the word\n\u2018registration\u2019 as used in the ACPA to initial registrations, it surely knew\nhow to do so.\u201d\n\nBy Evan D.

John Berryhill \u2013 Apr 15, 2024 11:14 AM\n\n\u201cHad Congress wished to restrict the word \u2018registration\u2019 as used in the ACPA\nto initial registrations, it surely knew how to do so.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that, until lawyers sought to twist what is often an automatic\nprocess based on stored payment information into \u201cre-registration\u201d, nobody\nreferred to renewal as \u201cre-registration\u201d. The ICANN RAA, for example, refers\nto \u201crenewal\u201d as \u201crenewal\u201d and not as \u201cre-registration.\u201d So, there was no need\nto limit the ACPA to exclude something that was not even a defined or industry\nstandard term for \u201crenewal\u201d.\n\n\u201cRe-registration\u201d is simply a term that was invented by IP attorneys to refer\nto renewals of domain names which are senior to the trademark they are seeking\nto enforce.\n\n# 1 Reply | Link | Report Problems\n\nCOMMENT PREVIEW\n\nCircleID Newsletter The Weekly Wrap\n\nMore and more professionals are choosing to publish critical posts on CircleID\nfrom all corners of the Internet industry.
