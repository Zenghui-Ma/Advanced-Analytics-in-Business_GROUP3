TF methods for\n> communications have been proposed very early (see the box History). While\n> several tutorial papers and book chapters on the topic are available (see,\n> e.g., [2]-[4] and references therein), the goal of this paper is to present\n> the fundamental aspects in a coherent and easily accessible manner.\n> Specifically, we establish the role of TF methods in communications across a\n> range of subject areas including TF dispersive channels, orthogonal\n> frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), information-theoretic limits, and\n> system identification and channel estimation. Furthermore, we present\n> fundamental results that are stated in the literature for the continuous-\n> time case in simple linear algebra terms.\n\nComments:| 9 pages, 3 figures; to appear in the IEEE Signal Processing\nMagazine Special Issue on Time-Frequency Analysis and Applications  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Information Theory (cs.IT)  \nCite as:| arXiv:1307.4790 [cs.IT]  \n(or arXiv:1307.4790v1 [cs.IT] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1307.4790arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Gerald Matz [view email] [v1] Wed, 17 Jul 2013 21:01:17 UTC (277 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Time-Frequency Foundations of Communications,\nby Gerald Matz and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.IT\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 1307\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs math math.IT\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### DBLP - CS Bibliography\n\nlisting | bibtex\n\nGerald Matz Helmut B\u00f6lcskei Franz Hlawatsch\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
