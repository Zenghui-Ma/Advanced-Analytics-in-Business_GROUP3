There have been many attempts at restoring vision by\nelectrically stimulating the retina, but those devices could only cause\nfleeting flashes of light called phosphenes. With more electrodes you might\nget more phosphenes, but I (and many others) have always had the concern that\na field of phosphenes is not really vision.\n\nIndeed: earlier patients might be able to reason their way through piecing\nlines into letters, but they weren\u2019t able to intuitively string them together\ninto words, much less words into sentences. Pixium\u2019s PRIMA implant is, to my\nknowledge, the first really definitive demonstration of what researchers call\n\u201cform vision\u201d (the ability to recognize visual elements as parts of a larger\nobject) in humans.\n\nFor a patient who has lost the light-sensitive cells in the eye \u2013 the\nphotoreceptors \u2013 but for whom the retina is otherwise intact such as in many\nrod-cone dystrophies, there are two principal cell types one might consider\ntargeting to restore the flow of visual information into the brain.\n\nRetinal ganglion cells, or RGCs, represent the tightest informational\nbottleneck of vision into the brain: the outputs of the RGCs form the \u201coptic\nnerve\u201d which connects the eye into the rest of the brain. These are the output\nlayer of the retina, where we would be theoretically least sensitive to\nwhatever disease state is present in the eye. RGCs are also readily targetable\nby existing AAV-based gene therapy technologies. On the other hand, the\ninformation representation found in RGCs (how they encode visual information)\nis complex and there are extremely stringent requirements for any device that\nmight be able to excite them selectively enough to reproduce such an encoding.\n\nAt the other end, bipolar cells are the first synapse past the photoreceptors.\nThey have the advantage of having much simpler representations compared to the\nRGCs, something much closer to the bitmapped image excited in the\nphotoreceptors. But, they aren\u2019t a true neuron (they use graded potentials,\nnot spikes, most of the time), which makes optogenetics more complex.\nAccessing them with a device usually means placing something under the retina,\nwhich is a potentially riskier procedure compared to placing something only in\nthe vitreous chamber or on the retinal surface.\n\nThere were reasons to believe that bulk electrical stimulation of dozens or\nhundreds of bipolar cells wouldn't produce form vision. There are many\ndifferent \"types\" of bipolar cells which convey different pieces of\ninformation, and in any case they may be too degraded in late-stage disease\nthat warranted an implant or gene therapy. Thanks to Pixium\u2019s preliminary\nstudy results, we know this is not the case, and activating the bipolars \u2013\neven largely non-selectively \u2013 can at least in some patients restore\nmeaningful vision. The retina is in many ways an ideal special case for this\nkind of electrical stimulation, and there's a clear pathway to further\nperformance improvements in future versions of the device.\n\nThe Pixium device works by being, in effect, a tiny solar panel with hundreds\nof tiny little sub-panels. If you hit one of these pixels with infrared light,\nyou will excite a small electric field directly above the point you\nilluminated. Wearing glasses with a camera and a small laser projector, an\nimage can be projected onto the implant, exciting the remaining bipolar cells,\nand thereby getting information back into the signal chain that ultimately\nleads to vision in the brain.\n\nFollowing acceptance of our bid by the French commercial court and French\nForeign Direct Investment approval, Science has agreed to acquire the assets\nof Pixium Vision SA. Pixium has three ongoing clinical trials with the PRIMA\ndevice, including a 38-patient pivotal study in Europe (NCT04676854). This\ntransaction also significantly strengthens our IP portfolio. Our goal is to\ncontinue and expand these studies to bring this device to patients.\n\nI want to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the Pixium team to get the\nPRIMA device to where it is now; it is literally several peoples\u2019 life\u2019s work.\nWe were highly impressed by their team, including Ralf, Karine, Brian,\nAlexandra, Offer and Lloyd, and we are very thankful for the work they did to\nhelp us understand the Pixium technology and ultimately make a deal possible.\n\nPRIMA came out of a concept originally developed by Prof. Daniel Palanker at\nStanford, and we\u2019re excited to collaborate with him on the next generations of\nthis device family.\n\nWhat does this mean for our optogenetic gene therapy and the Science Eye? It\u2019s\ntoo early to know which approach, electrical or optogenetic, will work best in\nthe retina long term as these technologies mature. But whichever is used 20\nyears from now, there is a huge amount of good all of these early devices can\ndo today. They represent very different approaches that make different\ntradeoffs and at least initially will probably target different patient\nsubpopulations. We would love to be able to offer a range of products to match\neach individual patient\u2019s needs with the best of what\u2019s available over time.\n\nScience now has best-in-class therapies targeting both the RGCs and bipolars.\nThrough these and other new technologies we pursue, we are committed to\nbringing meaningful restoration of useful vision to late stage rod-cone\ndystrophy patients globally as soon as possible.\n\nBack to top \u2191\n\nScience Eye\n\n## Offering new hope for patients with serious blindness due to photoreceptor\nloss.\n\nLearn how it works\n\nScience develops advanced medical technologies at the frontier of humanity's\ncapabilities and understanding.\n\nFor media inquiries please contact press@science.xyz\n\nInvestigational device shown.
