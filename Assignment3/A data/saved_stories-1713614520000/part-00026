NES\n\nAn exhuastive disassembly of the NES game Tecmo Super Bowl into a byte-for-\nbyte re-build of the original game. Every last instruction and memory location\nhas been re-verse engineered labeled and commented including best guesses at\nunused code.\n\n# History\n\nCreidt to jtsout from tecmobowl.org for converting the raw hex file into a\ndisassembly. Thanks to the work of him and others a few things were labeled\nand known (player data locations and string locations).\n\nI took that vastly uncommented/unlabled disassessmbly and over a number of\nyears got it to 100% commented and labeled around 2018.\n\nI have made numerous tools used in online play and hacks/changes to the game\nplay (2 point conversions, moving offensive lineman when collided, etc).\n\nTHere were a few opportunities to potentially remake the game that fell thru.\nGiven my lack of time to modify this further, as well as other reasons, I felt\nlike now would be a good time to release this. There are more in-depth\ndocuments I could create that explain how everything works but I just wanted\nto get the information out at this point.\n\n# Information\n\nSee the DOCS folder for many informational and useful files. Some of the more\nimportant ones:\n\nRom_map.xlsx is a good starting point as it explains where things are in the\nrom at very high level.\n\nBUGS_UNUSED_AND_HIDDEN_ITEMS - Explains some of the hidden and unused items in\nthe game as well as bugs in the game\n\nzero_page_variables.asm - Memory labels for zero page in the NES memory\n(0x00-0xFF)\n\nram_variables.asm - Memory labels for the remaining RAM in the NES memory\n(0x100-0x7FF)\n\nsram_variables.asm - Memory labels for the Save Memory in the NES memory\n(0x6000-0x7FFF)\n\n# Building\n\nBuilding the game is realtively simple. Download the repository. From the\ntools folder copy asm6f_32.exe and place it into the same folder as\nmasterbuild.asm. You will also need a master copy of the original rom. This\ngoes into the same folder as masterbuild.asm as well. It needs to be named\nTSB.nes.\n\nClick on asm6.bat to open DOS command prompt in the same folder as\nmaster_build.asm and type:\n\nasm6f_32.exe master_build.asm -L\n\nThis will build the game and give you a complete listing of the game.\n\n# CodeStyle\n\nUnfortunately I didn't make good choice with regards to code style when I\noriginally embarked on dissassembling the game so there is no clear convention\nto differentiate Variables, Labels, Macros, and Constants.\n\n# Viewing the code (NOTEPAD++)\n\nI try to use notepad++ styler to help indicate certain things to make up for\nthe poor style. Yellow for macros and Green for memory locations. The\n6502_tecmo_lang.xml in the DOCS folder can be imported into notepad++. This\nwill make the code a lot easier to read visually as well as allow you to fold\nthe code as well. I acheived cold folding by duplicating a lot of label names\nbut at the time I didn't see any other way of acheiving it. Given how many\nlines of assembly there are, folding is extremely useful\n\nTHings to search for *** = interesting comment BUG = bug in gameplay\n\n# Thanks\n\nThanks to Shinichiro Tomie and Akihiko Shimoji for creating such an amazing\ngame that has brought me so much joy. I have made many online and real life\nfriends because of this game.\n\nThis dissassembly would likely never have come to frution without the\ninspiration and help from others. Thanks to Matt Knobbe for creating the Tecmo\nSuper Bowl repository (https://tecmobowl.org/) which gave people a place to\nshare their love and information about the game.\n\nTHanks to jstout for his initial very raw and largely uncommented\ndissassembly. He also created some seminal hacks for tecmo super bowl.\n\nTHanks to all the people at nesdev and the nesdev wiki for all the information\nabout the NES architechture and programming for the NES.\n\n## About\n\nA disassembly of the game Tecmo Super Bowl into rebuildable 6502 source code\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n4 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n2 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Assembly 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
