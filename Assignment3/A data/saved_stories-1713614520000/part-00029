Those comments followed a warning by\nAmazon chief Andy Jassy this year that there was \u201cnot enough energy right now\u201d\nto run new generative AI services.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet are investing billions of dollars\nin computing infrastructure as they seek to build out their AI capabilities,\nincluding in data centres that typically take several years to plan and\nconstruct.\n\nBut some of the most popular places for building the facilities, such as\nnorthern Virginia, are facing capacity constraints which, in turn, are driving\na search for suitable sites in growing data centre markets globally.\n\n\u201cDemand for data centres has always been there, but it\u2019s never been like\nthis,\u201d said Pankaj Sharma, executive vice-president at Schneider Electric\u2019s\ndata centre division.\n\nAt present, \u201cwe probably don\u2019t have enough capacity available\u201d to run all the\nfacilities that will be required globally by 2030, said Sharma, whose unit is\nworking with chipmaker Nvidia to design centres optimised for AI workloads.\n\n\u201cOne of the limitations of deploying [chips] in the new AI economy is going to\nbe . . . where do we build the data centres and how do we get the power,\u201d said\nDaniel Golding, chief technology officer at Appleby Strategy Group and a\nformer data centre executive at Google. \u201cAt some point the reality of the\n[electricity] grid is going to get in the way of AI.\u201d\n\nThe power supply issue has also fuelled concerns about the latest technology\nboom\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nCountries worldwide need to meet renewable energy commitments and electrify\nsectors such as transportation in response to accelerating climate change. To\nsupport these changes, many nations will need to reform their electricity\ngrids, according to analysts.\n\nThe demands on the power grid are \u201ctop of mind\u201d for Amazon, said the company\u2019s\nsustainability chief, Kara Hurst, adding that she was \u201cregularly in\nconversation\u201d with US officials about the issue.\n\nData centres \u2014 industrial buildings, often covering large areas of land, that\nhouse the physical components underpinning computer systems, such as cabling,\nchips and servers \u2014 are part of the backbone of computing.\n\nRecommended\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nAI boom sparks concern over Big Tech\u2019s water consumption\n\nResearch group Dgtl Infra has estimated that global data centre capital\nexpenditure will surpass $225bn in 2024. Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang\nsaid this year that $1tn worth of data centres would need to be built in the\nnext several years to support generative AI, which is power intensive and\ninvolves the processing of enormous volumes of information.\n\nSuch growth would require huge amounts of electricity, even if systems become\nmore efficient. According to the International Energy Agency, the electricity\nconsumed by data centres globally will more than double by 2026 to more than\n1,000 terawatt hours, an amount roughly equivalent to what Japan consumes\nannually.\n\n\u201cUpdated regulations and technological improvements, including on efficiency,\nwill be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data\ncentres,\u201d the IEA said this year.\n\nUS data centre electricity consumption is expected to grow from 4 per cent to\n6 per cent of total demand by 2026, while the AI industry is forecast to\nexpand \u201cexponentially\u201d and consume at least 10 times its 2023 demand by 2026,\nsaid the IEA.\n\nEven before the generative AI boom, some major markets were struggling to keep\nup with demand. It can take years for new renewable energy projects such as\nwind farms to gain regulatory approval and be connected to the grid. There is\nalso a need in some places to build new transmission lines that carry\nelectricity from one point to another.\n\nIn northern Virginia, the world\u2019s largest data centre hub, power provider\nDominion Energy paused new data centre connections in 2022 while it analysed\nhow to deal with the jump in demand, including by upgrading parts of its\nnetwork.\n\nIn October, the company said in filings to a Virginia regulator that it was\nexperiencing \u201csignificant load growth due to data centre development\u201d and that\ngrowing power demands presented a \u201cchallenge\u201d.\n\nRecommended\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nAI\u2019s electricity problem\n\nIn response to the demand, authorities in jurisdictions including Ireland and\nthe Netherlands have sought to limit new data centre developments, while\nSingapore recently lifted a moratorium.\n\nDevelopers are looking to build sites in growing areas such as the US states\nof Ohio and Texas, regions of Italy and eastern Europe, Malaysia and India,\naccording to analysts.\n\nFinding appropriate sites can be challenging, with power just one factor to\nconsider among others such as the availability of large volumes of water to\ncool data centres.\n\n\u201cFor every 50 sites I look at, maybe two get to the point where they may be\ndeveloped,\u201d said Appleby Strategy\u2019s Golding. \u201cFolks are sifting through large\nnumbers of properties.\u201d\n\nThe concerns have driven interest among data centre developers in options such\nas onsite power generation and nuclear energy, with Microsoft this year hiring\na director of \u201cnuclear development acceleration\u201d.\n\nVideo: AI: a blessing or curse for humanity? | FT Tech\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
