Would\nthe US defense system be about to shoot it down? How much warning would we\nhave to choose how to respond? The US homeland ballistic missile defense\narchitecture centers on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, or GMD for\nshort. It is designed to protect all 50 states from a limited long-range\nballistic missile attack. Remember when I was talking about how, broadly\nspeaking, these defense systems work by tracking, then destroying before\nimpact? Well, broadly speaking, the GMD works like that: after detecting a\nmissile launch, GMD\u2019s sensors feed the data into a central control system,\nwhich then launches one or more interceptor missiles, which in turn, fly into\nthe path of the incoming missile, release a kill vehicle and destroy the\nattacker\u2019s missile on impact. But as I said, this is broadly speaking, very\nbroadly. In truth, the GMD is a global system with 11 elements that span 15\ntime zones, and each element has to be precisely coordinated. And if something\nfails, everything can go wrong. Mock up of missile defense annual performance\nreview 'Shows great potential, but tends to space out at critical moments.\u201d\nAccording to Annie Jacobsen\u2019s book Nuclear War a scenario in which she\ninterviewed the actual military and civilian experts who built these weapons;\nand developed all the response plans; she outlined how modern day satellite\nmissile tracking can detect a ICBM launch in just seconds. Technology for\ndetecting threats has vastly improved. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the\ntechnology has solved the age old problem of hitting a bullet with another\nbullet so to speak. Detecting and tracking is very different from shooting\ndown. A new developments in submarine and air launched missiles means instead\nof 30 minute window it could be as little as 15 minutes to reach their\ntargets. But first, Let\u2019s talk about the elements that make the GMD what it\nis, starting with how it tracks missiles, and then we\u2019ll dive into how it\ndestroys them. The GMD tracking depends on seven types of sensors: land, sea,\nand space. Join this channel to get access to perks: / @taskandpurpose Task &\nPurpose is a military news and culture oriented channel.
