Who were the men\nwho tried to make their city-states rule the waves more than 2000 years ago,\nand what was naval warfare like during that time?\n\nIn ancient Greece, a complex military system developed to win battles at sea;\nutilizing the efforts of oarsmen and marine soldiers alongside innovative and\nconstantly evolving naval tactics and substantial technological developments.\nThere was no specific \u2018Greek\u2019 navy \u2014 as indeed there was actually no \u2018Greece,\u2019\nas we would come to understand it, during that time. What we know today as\n\u2018Ancient Greece\u2019 was actually a collection of more than 1,500 independent\ncity-states (poleis, singular polis), spread across a geographic area\ngenerally consistent with that of modern Greece.\n\nGreece in the Archaic Age (ca. 750 - 490 BC). World History Encyclopedia, CC\nBY-SA 4.0\n\nEach raised military forces to defend its interests both at home and abroad \u2013\nsome specialized in land-based armies, while others prioritized the\ndevelopment of powerful fleets, although many were able to maintain\ncapabilities in both domains.\n\nThe earliest naval warfare in ancient Greece probably took the form of coastal\nraiding, organized by private individuals acting more in the form of pirates\nthan any state-sponsored fleet. This type of raiding is documented in early\nGreek literature such as Homer\u2019s Odyssey. The first naval battle may have\ntaken place as early as 660 BC, according to the Greek historian Thucydides,\nalthough the first which can be reconstructed with any detail took place at\nLade in 495 BC. From this point on, wars in Greece, whether intra-Greek or\nagainst foreign invaders, were fought on both land and sea \u2013 and the main\nwarship used to do so was the powerful trireme.\n\n## The Trireme\n\nThe classic vessel associated with ancient Greek marine warfare was the\naforementioned trieres \u2013 better known by its Latin title, the trireme (the\nname that is preferred here) \u2013 which was named for the three \u2018banks\u2019 of\noarsmen which powered its movement. Although oar-powered in battle, the\ntrireme was also fitted with two sails for general seafaring.\n\nModel of a Greek trireme. MatthiasKabel via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\nThe main weapon of the trireme was a bronze ram fitted to its prow, capable of\npenetrating the boards of enemy vessels and, if not sinking them, causing them\nto wallow to the degree that the crew was forced to abandon ship. They could\nalso smash the oars of enemy vessels, rendering them ineffective. Several\nancient Greek rams have been recovered from the Mediterranean; one example,\nhoused in the Piraeus Archaeological Museum, vividly illustrates the vicious\ncapability of these weapons.\n\nRam of an ancient war ship, probably a trireme, 4th century. B.C. George E.\nKoronaios via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-SA-4.0\n\nTriremes were a marvel of engineering in their time, balancing the need for\nspeed (and thus number of oarsmen) with the practicalities of keeping the\nvessel balanced and stable. Their low center of gravity provided additional\nstability whilst minimizing the risk of capsizing when maneuvering. These\ncharacteristics made triremes incredibly effective in battle, allowing them to\nperform sharp turns and rapid movements \u2014 although this did come at the cost\nof reducing their overall seaworthiness. Triremes were, however, vulnerable to\neven moderate swells, and in the rough seas of unexpected storms, entire\nfleets could be lost.\n\nGreek vase painting showing a trireme with ram. Unknown author, Wikimedia\nCommons\n\nA fleet was a substantial financial investment. Triremes were expensive and\nlabor-intensive to build, and many were commissioned by wealthy individuals as\ncontributions to the state. If well-maintained, they could endure more than\ntwenty-five years in service, although this required them to be dragged onto\nthe shore overnight when possible, with the crew then \u2018de-boarding\u2019 for the\nnight \u2014 leaving them vulnerable to surprise attacks.\n\nThe replica trireme Olympias at Marina Zeas, Piraeus, Greece, on May 4, 2019.\nInitially, the trireme was used as part of an experimental archeological\nproject, in order for scientists to determine the sailing characteristics,\nbattle tactics and living conditions inside the vessel.

A fleet was therefore a huge investment financially as\nwell as in terms of manpower.\n\nThe Lenormant Relief, from the Athenian Acropolis, depicting the rowers of an\naphract Athenian trireme, c. 410 BC, found in 1852. Marsyas via Wikimedia\nCommons, CC-BY-SA-2.5\n\nThere were typically 170 oarsmen on each ship, providing the speed and power a\ntrireme would rely on in battle, distributed across three banks of rowers.\nOarsmen were usually drawn from the lower levels of society, including the\npoor, mercenaries, and even slaves \u2014 in the case of the latter, they could be\nfreed if they performed well in battle. 62 rowers, known as \u2018thranites\u2019, were\npositioned above the hull, and probably comprised the most experienced oarsmen\n\u2014 they were probably paid more than the other rowers, and were the only ones\nwho could see outside the ship during battle. Inset from them were 54 more\nrowers, known as \u2018zygioi\u2019, with a further 54, referred to as \u2018thalamoi\u2019,\npositioned below them/ The names given to the three banks of rowers were\ncomparable to ranks, identifying where on the ship they sat to row.\n\nCross-section of a trireme, an ancient Greek combat galley, following the last\narchaeological discoveries about this type of ship. Eric Gaba via Wikimedia\nCommons, CC-BY-SA-4.0\n\nRowing a warship was a skilled job, and well-trained crews were highly valued;\nsubstantial instruction was required for new recruits to reach the required\nlevels of performance. The physical demands of battle were significant, and it\nwould have been easy for even experienced oarsmen to become fatigued. Seasoned\nand capable oarsmen could be offered extra money to lure them into further\nservice \u2014 which was perhaps no surprise, given the better training and the\nskill it brought. In many ancient Greek naval battles, having oarsmen of this\nquality made the difference between victory and defeat.\n\nA trireme on the Thames at the 2500th anniversary of the premier democracy in\nLondon, United Kingdom on June 17, 1993.

The vessel would be commanded by a 'trierarch,'\neither the owner of the ship or (particularly in times of active warfare) an\nexperienced individual hand-picked for the job. There was also a helmsman, a\nrowing master, a purser, a bow officer, a carpenter, a flute player (who would\nuse sound to direct movement in battle), and someone to look after the sails.\n\nBelow the deck of Olympia At Marina Zeas, Piraeus, Greece, May 4, 2019.

Typically this would\ncomprise ten soldiers known as 'epibatai,' or 'naval hoplites,' armed in the\nsame manner as land-based infantry. They had two main jobs \u2014 to try and board\nthe enemy ships when an opportune moment arose, and to repel attempts to board\ntheir own.\n\nWhile ten epibatai were the minimum, more could be used in battles where the\naim was to board as many enemy ships as possible, a tactic particularly used\nin confined waterscapes, with up to forty known to have been deployed per ship\nunder such circumstances. Supporting the epibatai would be a small number of\narchers, usually four, who could rain down arrows on the enemy during battle.\nWith an effective range of up to 500-550 feet, archers could try and pick off\nindividual officers on enemy ships during battle, aiming to create chaos among\nthe crews left behind. Despite often being limited in number, these archers\nplayed a key role in battle.\n\n## Fighting at Sea\n\nWhile fleets engaged in a number of activities, from transporting troops to\nblockading enemy harbors and coastlines, their main purpose was fighting\nengagements at sea. But entering into a naval battle was a risky decision, and\nnot one to be taken lightly. Although the gains in victory were substantial,\nthe economic and manpower losses of defeat could be significant, too \u2014 and\neven victorious sides could find themselves heavily impacted by their efforts.\n\nCrews were trained in battle maneuvers, sometimes when they were already in\nclose proximity to the enemy. Although some naval battles took place as soon\nas two enemy fleets encountered each other, many occurred only after several\ndays of preparation and strategizing. While this training may have helped with\nthe tactical aspects of naval battle, it likely did little to prepare them for\nthe horrific realities of fighting at sea, including the injuries that could\nbe sustained from a direct hit to the oars or from an arrow, and abandoning\nship. Crews could be reluctant to engage in battle, particularly if they had\nrecently taken part in a defeat, and the ancient Greek historian Thucydides\nnoted that a good fleet commander had to keep a keen eye out for ships that\nseemed hesitant to advance and make a special effort to ensure they followed\ntheir orders to do so.\n\nIllustration of the naval Battle of Aegospotami, Hellespont, 405 BC, during\nwhich the Spartan admiral Lysander destroyed the Athenian fleet thus ending\nthe Peloponnesian War. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via\nGetty Images\n\nThe primary objective was to neutralize the threat offered by the opposition\nfleet, either by sinking/incapacitating, or boarding. Ramming played a key\nrole in most ancient Greek naval battles, aiming to use the bronze rams fitted\nto the front of each trireme to rip holes in the side or rear of an enemy\nvessel.\n\nRams had been key parts of maritime weaponry before the development of the\ntrireme. The first known naval engagement where ramming played a key tactical\nrole was the Battle of Alalia (c. 540-535 BC), fought off the coast of Corsica\nbetween Phocaean Greeks and the Carthaginians. By the 5th century BC, it had\nbecome the predominant tactic used in naval battles.\n\nAs the aim was to ram the side or rear of the ship, Greek fleets needed to get\neither through or around their enemy\u2019s naval formation, and had two main\nmethods for doing so: the 'diekplous' and the 'periplous.'\n\nThe diekplous saw ships trying to break through the enemy\u2019s line, allowing a\nship to sail through the gap and attack from the rear, while the periplous saw\nships try and outflank and encircle the enemy, allowing them to attack to the\nside and rear.\n\nIllustration of the diekplous. Jo Ball\n\nIllustration of the periplous. Jo Ball\n\nAs a defensive measure against these attacks, ships could adopt a bow-out\ncircle formation known as a 'kyklos' (literally \u2018circle\u2019), to prevent them\nfrom being outflanked, from which they could try and attack individual ships,\nwhile the enemy circled at speed to try and find or create gaps in the\nformation. Fear of being outflanked could also lead fleets to deploy with one\nside close to the shore, to minimize the chance of finding the enemy on both\nsides (and so survivors could reach safety on land if forced to abandon ship).\n\nIllustration of the kyklos. Jo Ball\n\nIt did not take a vast amount of speed to penetrate a ship\u2019s hull. Estimates\nsuggest somewhere between four and eight knots, which would not be too\ndifficult to achieve outside of very confined naval battlescapes \u2014 modern\nreenactments have suggested that even relatively relaxed rowing would produce\naround six knots of speed. Over time, warship design evolved to have stronger\nhulls with additional beams to reinforce the areas they would most likely be\nhit, although the response to this development was to angle rams downwards so\nthey would hit below the strengthened area.\n\nTriremes in battle. There was only a handful of armed men on deck. Most of the\ncasualties happened when Triremes, shattered by the rams of the enemy, spilled\ntheir men into the water. They either drowned, or were speared by enemy\nmarines. Brown Bear/Windmil Books/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nWhile ramming was highly effective in battle, it was not easy to achieve,\nparticularly with inexperienced crews, which was one reason why trained\noarsmen were highly valued. From the 3rd century BC onwards, ships could try\nand set the enemy\u2019s vessels on fire during battle, not to sink them, but to\ncreate a disruption that could lead the rowers to abandon their posts \u2014\nparticularly if the ships began to fill with smoke \u2014 exposing the side and\nrear to a ram attack. Breaking the enemy\u2019s oars could also reduce their\nmovement capabilities and make them more vulnerable to ramming, while also\ncausing serious, even fatal, injuries to the oarsmen manning them; something\nwhich must have been traumatic for those rowing nearby.\n\nAlthough ramming was the most effective way to win a battle at sea, it was not\nthe only method used to try and gain the upper hand. Marine soldiers could\nattempt to use grappling irons to get a fix on a ship, board it, and fight\nwith the soldiers on it in an attempt to gain control \u2014 or to distract the\ncrew for long enough for their rams to reach it. This method would often be\npreferred when one fleet knew it lacked the speed of their enemy\u2019s vessels,\nleading them to choose brute force over rapid maneuvering and ramming, or in\nmore confined naval battle areas where the necessary momentum would be hard to\nestablish.\n\n## Naval Warfare in Ancient Greece\n\nFighting at sea played a key role in Ancient Greek warfare alongside its land-\nbased counterpart, with most wars containing episodes of both land and\nmaritime conflict. While most city-states maintained both land and sea forces,\nmany were more proficient in one or the other. For instance, Sparta was known\nfor its infantry, while rivaling Athens relied on a powerful navy.\n\nIn times of crisis from foreign invasion, the Greek city-states could ally\nthemselves in the face of a common threat, combining the best of their\ninfantry and marine forces. During the Second Persian Invasion of Greece\n(480-479 BC), the Persian advance over land was initially blocked by an army\nat the pass of Thermopylae, spearheaded by King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans,\nwhile a 271-ship naval force led by the Athenians assaulted the Persian fleet\nin Straits of Artemisium \u2014 with both conflicts taking place in the same three-\nday period. The Athenians had spent several years building up their navy in\nexpectation of the invasion, and a prediction from the Oracle at Delphi had\ngiven them cause to believe their faith in the ships was justified. It told\nthem that the \u201cwooden wall\u201d would not fall, which the Athenian general\nThemistocles assured the population, referred to the wooden hulls of the\nAthenian fleet \u2013 and indeed, they did not fall. After later being defeated at\nSalamis (sea), Plataea (land), and Mycale (sea), the Persians withdrew from\nGreece, never to return.\n\nFleet of triremes made up of photographs of the modern full-sized replica\nOlympias. Tungsten via Wikimedia Commons, CC-PD-Mark\n\nDuring the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), the terrestrial might of Sparta was\npitched directly against the naval power of Athens. The differences in their\nmilitary strength meant that the conflict was inconclusive for long periods,\nas Sparta embarked on large-scale but strategically ineffective invasions of\nAthenian territory while Athens avoided land-based battles in favor of\nfighting a largely defensive campaign against Spartan allies by sea. The tide\nturned in Sparta\u2019s favor when a new general, Lysander, proved surprisingly\nadept at warfare, successfully challenging Athens\u2019 maritime dominance \u2014 and\nending it forever.\n\nNaval engagements could be a brutal part of Ancient Greek warfare, but with\nthe right crews, ships, and tactics, it could also be a decisive one. Large\nfleets with capable complements allowed Greek city-states, particularly\nAthens, to wield significant power in and around the Mediterranean Sea.\nActually being in a naval battle was likely a brutal experience for those\ninvolved, and it is easy to imagine crews becoming reluctant to engage in the\naftermath of recent defeat. Despite the defeat of Athens in the Peloponnesian\nWar demonstrating that a strong fleet was not always enough to ensure victory,\nmaritime power would remain a key element of warfare in the Mediterranean (and\nbeyond) for millennia afterward.\n\nDr. Jo Ball is a University Teacher and Honorary Research Fellow at the\nUniversity of Liverpool.
