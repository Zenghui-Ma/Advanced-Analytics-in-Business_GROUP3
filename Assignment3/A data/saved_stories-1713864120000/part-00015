Avian influenza\nhas caused the catastrophic die-off of thousands of elephant seals in\nArgentina, raising concerns for wildlife and human cross-species transmission.\n(Ralph Vanstreels, UC Davis)\n\nResearchers in Argentina recently reported the first outbreak of high\npathogenicity H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in elephant seals.\n\nThe outbreak killed 70% of elephant seal pups born in the 2023 breeding\nseason, according to research co-led by the UC Davis School of Veterinary\nMedicine and published in Marine Mammal Science. The mortality rate reached at\nleast 96% by early November 2023 in the surveyed areas at Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s in\nArgentina.\n\n\u201cThis outbreak is the greatest calamity to affect wildlife, particularly\nmarine mammals, in South America in recent history,\u201d said co-author Marcela\nUhart, a veterinarian with the UC Davis Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center\nand its Latin America Program\n\nThe outbreak has also caused the death of thousands of South American sea\nlions and fewer fur seals along the Argentine Patagonia coastline and now\nextends into Uruguay and southern Brazil. The virus has also been found in\nseabirds, particularly several species of terns.\n\n\u201cThere is not much we can do once HPAI reaches wildlife populations,\u201d Uhart\nsaid. \u201cWe need to acknowledge and work to minimize these impacts, including\ncontrolling what we can, such as poultry farm biosecurity, to reduce the\nchance of a continuing cycle of disease spread.\u201d\n\n### Avian Influenza Media Experts\n\nUC Davis experts on poultry medicine, virology, biosecurity and more.\n\nThis investigation was done in collaboration with scientists from the Wildlife\nConservation Society including Claudio Campagna, Valeria Falabella, Julieta\nCampagna, and Victoria Zavattieri.
