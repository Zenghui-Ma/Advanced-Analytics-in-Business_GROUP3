Forget the \u201c3-5\nyears away\u201d timelines previously advanced by Razib Khan and Charles Murray.\nEmbryo selection for IQ will become publicly available in 2025, opening up the\npossibility of 6-7 IQ point increases with every subsequent generation. And\nthat\u2019s just with the standard IVF cycles of ten embryos. More speculative but\nscientifically grounded approaches in the pipeline such as embryo genetic\nediting, adult gene therapy, iterated embryo selection, and synthetic embryos\nopen up the possibility of multiple S.D. increases in polygenic IQ scores by\nthe 2030s, and the appearance of young men and women much smarter than anybody\nwho has ever lived as early as the 2050s.\n\nIn this essay, I will briefly outline the basics of intelligence research, and\nits relationship to individual life success, national wellbeing, and the long-\nterm prospects of our civilization. I will then make make the case for radical\nhuman intelligence enhancement across all three of those levels. I will then\nsurvey public attitudes towards intelligence enhancement, outline the business\ncase for the noocelerationist space and its synergies with Decentralized\nScience (DeScI), and conclude with an overview of my own plans for Sophia DAO\nand how you can get involved.\n\n##\n\nPsychometrics 101: What is Intelligence?\n\nWhat is intelligence? The standard academic definition is given by Linda\nGottfredson:\n\n> Intelligence is \u2018the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think\n> abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from\n> experience\u2019.\n\nThough personally, I prefer Jean Piaget\u2019s more succinct version:\n\n> Intelligence is what you need when you don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAs well as the English writer Samuel Johnson\u2019s poetic formulation, as quoted\nby Arthur Jensen in The g Factor:\n\n> Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) expressed it tersely when he heard a noted\n> historian proclaim that it was by virtue of their very different gifts that\n> Caesar became a great commander, Shakespeare a great poet, and Newton a\n> great scientist. Dr. Johnson replied, \u2018 \u2018No, it is only that one man has\n> more mind than another; he may direct it differently, or prefer this study\n> to that. Sir, the man who has vigor may walk to the North as well as to the\n> South, to the East as well as to the West.\u201d\n\nThe foundational core of intelligence research can be summarized in the\nfollowing seven statements:\n\n  1. Intelligence can be rigorously & reliably measured.\n\n  2. The spread of people across the IQ continuum follows a normal curve (or bell curve)1.\n\n  3. All cognitive abilities load on a common factor of intelligence known as the general factor, or g.\n\n  4. The g factor is universal across human cultures2 and is even observed in animals3.\n\n  5. Heritability of intelligence is ~0.7-0.8.\n\n  6. Intelligence research is by far the most well replicated branch of the psychological sciences.\n\n  7. Intelligence is strongly predictive of individual life success & positive group outcomes such as GDP per capita & innovation rates.\n\nIt is again worth underlining that there is nothing fringe about this - these\nare the mainstream views in the field4. Contra ideologically loaded critiques,\nthese are the views of political moderates; as per expert surveys, the typical\nintelligence researcher is a classical liberal who strongly supports gay\nmarriage5. Historically, both Nazis and Communists opposed intelligence\nresearch and persecuted its practitioners6.\n\nConsequently, it is of scant surprise that psychometrics is the single most\nreplicated branch of the psychological sciences:\n\nSteven Pinker on the replication crisis (or lack thereof) in intelligence\nresearch.\n\nHowever, the most important reason for studying intelligence isn\u2019t even so\nmuch on account of its high epistemic standards, but because it is extremely\npredictive of many aspects of the world that would otherwise leave you in\npermanent confusion. Ultimately, much of life is about navigating your way\nthrough problems of interminable difficulty. Individuals who are better at\nsolving problems enjoy greater life success, and their labor commands a higher\npremium. Likewise, groups which have more smart people capable of solving hard\nproblems tend to create richer and more functional teams, companies, and\nsocieties. And at the global level, it is entirely possible that some problems\nof global existential importance might only be solvable if a critical mass of\nelite mindpower was to be brought to bear on them.\n\n##\n\nThe g Nexus and the O-Ring\n\nAt the individual level, there exists a positive manifold or \u201cg nexus\u201d across\nintelligence and virtually all indicators of life success, including but not\nlimited to: Lifetime income, education (e.g. high school dropout rates;\nprobability of getting a college degree); crime and prison risk; job\nperformance; and politics under any regime (both US Congressmen and the Nazis\nunder trial at Nuremberg scored far above the population average)7.\n\nIf we were in a video game, intelligence would be regarded as \u201cOP\u201d\n(overpowered) to an extent that many would regard as unfair and game-breaking\nwere they aware of the mechanics. Even to the extent that people are aware of\nthis, it is usually accompanied by a lot of cope to the effect that\nintelligence ceases being predictive of life success beyond some threshold, or\ncomes with serious debuffs on other character stats. However, there are no\nindications of diminishing returns to IQ beyond any particular level. Smarter\npeople live longer and healthier lives - indeed, polygenic IQ scores are the\nsingle best currently extant predictors of longevity8. Nor is there any\nevidence that smart people are more unhappy, have lower \u201cemotional\nintelligence\u201d, or have more mental health issues9. The latter does not appear\nto be true outside of autism10.\n\nThe predictive power of intelligence, while formidable at the individual\nlevel, becomes phenomenal at the group level. An individual can be smart, but\nhampered by personality defects, low conscientiousness, or banal bad luck.\nHowever, in a team, company, or country, these other factors are largely\naveraged out, and the influence of raw intelligence becomes even more\ndominant. Consequently, while the correlation between intelligence and life\nsuccess is usually around 0.4, at the national level the correlation between\nnational IQ and GDP per capita11 and general function12 rises to an amazing\n0.7.\n\nWhat about the question of causality? This has been exhaustively addressed in\nthe literature, and has been found to mostly run from national IQ to economic\nsuccess1314. I will not go into the statistical details here. Instead, I will\ninvite the reader to dwell on the above graph. As we can see, there are two\nmajor groups of outliers: Countries that are big oil exporters (much richer\nthan predicted by IQ), and countries from the ex-Communist bloc (much poorer\nthan predicted by IQ). These exceptions prove the rule - we would not expect\nto see them if mere poverty played the biggest role in explaining national IQ\ndifferences. Instead, we find that the biggest gap between high IQ potential\nand economic underperformance is in China, which has human capital on a par\nwith the other developed East Asian economies but lower-middle income GDP per\ncapita. This discrepancy becomes much more understandable when you recall that\nChina spend 30 years under Maoism, a schizophrenic economic system in which\nyou had a higher chance of dying on the job than getting fired that made\nSoviet central planning seem sane and rational. Conversely, just as this model\nwould predict, China enjoyed the highest growth rates of any big country for\ndecades on end after market liberalization.\n\nWhy are smarter countries more productive? One way to look at it is to view\nthe economy as a system for generating and trading solutions to problems.\nThese problems come in two forms1516. The first category are \u201cFoolproof\u201d\nproblems that most anyone can solve with varying degrees of efficiency.\nExamples of Foolproof problems include truckers, barbers, and waiters. The\nsecond category encompasses \u201cO-Ring\u201d problems that require the completion of\nmultiple complicated steps by workers above some competency threshold. This\nincludes things such as open heart surgeries, semiconductor design, corporate\nM&As, or aircraft manufacturing. To make a successful product, all steps have\nto be done just right, as encapsulated by the eponymous O-Ring, the critical\nrubber seal interlinking the body of the Space Shuttle, whose catastrophic\nfailure under cold weather conditions led to the Challenger disaster of 1986.\n\nOnly a select \u201csmart fraction\u201d of the population can work in the O-Ring\nsector, so their labor commands a large premium on global markets. The size of\nthis \u201csmart fraction\u201d differs significantly between countries, much more so\nthan mere IQ averages imply due to bell curve mathematics. For instance, 6% of\nBelgians can solve the hardest class of problems on the PISA international\nstandard tests, whereas in Brazil, only a tiny fraction of high school\nstudents can do anything much more complex than a simple, single-step\narithmetic operation. Furthermore, since there\u2019s a large degree of labor\nmobility between these two sectors within countries - a chip designer can\nalways become a waiter - this pushes up wages in the Foolproof sector far\nbeyond what they would otherwise be in a society with no substantial O-Ring\nsector to speak of. It is the relative strength of the O-Ring sector in the\ndeveloped world - and the large \u201csmart fractions\u201d that enable it - which\nexplains why a hairdresser earns five times as much in Belgium as in Brazil,\neven though you will not otherwise expect a Belgian haircut to be innately\n\u201cbetter\u201d than a Brazilian one.\n\n##\n\nEscaping the Great Stagnation\n\nSince the end of the Malthusian era, science-based technological growth has\nbeen the source of almost all long-term economic growth. It propels our\nproductivity and opens up the prospect of transhumanist ascension sometime\nthis century. There\u2019s only two problems. First, its core driver - innovation -\nis extremely concentrated in the world\u2019s richest and smartest countries.\nSecond, the global \u201csmart fraction\u201d that drives this appears to be in absolute\ndecline.\n\nNature Index score (2017) per capita by country (US = 100).\n\nSo far as global innovation is concerned, it is really just a story of the\nhigh IQ rich nations. The Nature Index is an index of elite science production\nbased on the numbers of papers published in the most prestigious science\njournals. As of 2018, the US accounted for 33% of the global total, the \u201cold\u201d\nEU 26%, and East Asia 27% (inc. China with 18%). The rest of the world is a\nscientific desert: <2% in Eastern Europe, 1.6% in India, 1.1% in Latin\nAmerica, 0.7% in the Islamic world, and a mere 0.2% in Sub-Saharan Africa (of\nwhich South Africa in turn accounts for three quarters). In a study, we found\nthat the strongest predictor here was national IQ, with affective autonomy -\n\u201cthe independent pursuit of pleasure, seeking enjoyment by any means without\ncensure\u201d - the only other significant factor17.\n\nNow the good news is that average IQ has increased throughout the 20th century\nthanks to more schooling and exposure to abstract concepts, better nutrition,\nand the near elimination of many endemic diseases18. This is commonly known as\nthe Flynn Effect. Moreover, so far as we can make out, the gap between the\ndeveloped and developing worlds has been slowly narrowing in recent decades19.\nThis is unsurprising, because the latter have more scope to optimize the\nenvironment for greater health and IQ. However, this already hints at a deeper\nproblem. The environment for increasing IQ in the developed world is already\nmostly \u201cmaxxed out\u201d, while the Flynn Effect stalled several decades ago, and\nhas now gone into reverse20.\n\nThe root causes are likely linked to \u201cdysgenic\u201d reproduction, which refers to\nthe phenomenon of smart people having fewer children than duller people, as in\nthe 2006 movie Idiocracy. Although politically controversial, this thesis has\nbeen validated in a number of country studies, including in the US/UK21 and\nIceland22, as well as in a much broader recent meta-analysis. The general\npicture is that polygenic IQ scores are falling by 0.3-0.4 points per decade,\nand have been doing so for many decades. Furthermore, dysgenics is actually\nworse in the developing world, which has higher fertility rates, especially\namongst the more traditional/backwards rural populations.\n\nThis constitutes a step change from the historical norm. Reproduction seems to\nhave been \u201ceugenic\u201d in terms of intelligence in Great Britain and much of\nEurope from at least the Renaissance to the Late Enlightenment23. This was\nalso probably true for much of the world for most of the past 10,000 years24.\n(The main notable exception appears to have been the Classical World25, and it\nis perhaps a telling one, in light of its eventual collapse and descent into\nthe Dark Ages). The dysgenic reversal probably began in Early Industrialism,\nwhen the world began to escape the Malthusian trap of the prior subsistence\nage - an unsurpassed triumph of human welfare that brought untold levels of\nprosperity, reason, and moral enlightenment, but not without its long-term\ntimebombs.\n\nNow these negative trends might be of purely academic interest were it not for\nsome foreboding signs that - with the notable exception of IT - the rate of\ninnovation is falling. Libertarians tend to ascribe this to the baleful impact\nof metastasizing institutions, often citing Eroom\u2019s Law - the plummeting rate\nof new drugs discovery after the creation of the FDA - as an illustrative\nexample.\n\nCEPR: Historical Index of Economic Liberty shows steady increase from 1850 to\n2020, although sharply punctuated by the World Wars.\n\nThe problem with this explanation is that - trigger warning for strong\nlibertarians! - our current institutions are actually quite good from a\nhistorical perspective. Global economic freedom has never been higher. The\nsocialist world has collapsed both politically and epistemically, its\nsurviving relicts like Cuba and Best Korea a byword for repressive stagnation,\nand its new adherents, like Venezuela, a cautionary tale of ruin. I have found\nthat the global rate of corruption has collapsed during this century, with the\npercentage of firms reporting tax officials expecting bribes falling from\nalmost 50% in 2002 to less than 20% by the mid-2020s, as per the World Bank\u2019s\nEnterprise Surveys. Consequently, I just do not see the case for how\ninstitutional ossification can explain the innovation and productivity\nslowdown - though this is not to say that that current levels of economic\nfreedom shouldn\u2019t be even higher.\n\nI would posit that the decline in innovation is sooner a function of three\ndistinct adverse developments. First, there is the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d effect\n- that is, over time, the problems that need to be solved in order for\ntechnological growth at a constant pace become harder. In mathematics, the\nPythagorean Theorem is easier than Inter-universal Teichm\u00fcller Theory. In\ntechnology, the potentialities of the internal combustion engine had become\nlarge exhausted by the end of the 20th century. Second, the amount of \u201celite\nmindpower\u201d available to work on solving those problems has reached an\nasymptote, and might now be in absolute decline. At least, that is the logical\ndeduction from the end of the Flynn Effect in the developed world, which\nCOVID-19 appears to have tipped into outright reversal26. Now to be sure, the\neffectiveness of this mindpower can still be increased, e.g. by improving\ninstitutions, increasing labor mobility (Open Borders?), or applying new\ntechnologies - from lenses in Renaissance Italy to LLMs today.\n\nBut it remains an open question whether that will be sufficient to get us to\nthe glorious transhumanist future.\n\nRobin Hanson preaching fertility-innovation collapse doom at the Vitalia\nconference in Pr\u00f3spera, Honduras.\n\nThird, there is an accelerating fertility collapse throughout the world.\nConsequently, not only are the new generations duller, they are also fewer of\nthem27. Robin Hanson argues that falling fertility levels presage an\n\u201cinnovation pause\u201d since innovation depends on a growing economy. My own view\nis that this is both optimistic as well as pessimistic. Optimistic because\nHanson doesn\u2019t (explicitly) model the additional effect of dysgenics and \u201clow\nhanging fruit\u201d. Pessimistic because he is unduly dismissed of the potential of\nreprogenetics tech to accelerate biological IQ28. But more on that later.\n\nFor now, my modest hope is that I conveyed the following points: Intelligence\nis important, and a lack of it makes individuals less happy and less\nsuccessful; nations poorer and less functional; and the long-term prospects of\nour technological civilization darker and gloomier. From this, it follows that\nincreasing biological intelligence in all respects is not just an economic,\nbut an ethical and existential imperative.\n\n##\n\nThe Case for Nooceleration\n\nIn this blog\u2019s inaugural post, I defined \u201cnooceleration\u201d \ud83e\uddec\u23e9 as follows:\n\n> At its most basic level, noocelerationism (n/acc) loads on the idea that the\n> scope of rational x self-aware thought is what we should be optimizing for\n> on this planet. Loading on Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s and Vladimir\n> Vernadsky\u2019s concept of the \u201cnoosphere\u201d - the globe-spanning realm of\n> rational and self-aware thought - it is informed by the intuition that a\n> world of intricately carved rocks doesn\u2019t actually have a noosphere as such!\n> (it\u2019s just the geosphere). Therefore, so long as neither alignment nor\n> consciousness has been solved, it is far better to differentially accelerate\n> towards a \u201cBiosingularity\u201d as opposed to tinkering with the cyber gray goo.\n> Conversely, conformist safetyism or Luddite flight into the \u201cpeace and\n> safety of a new dark age\u201d is no panacea either, resulting in a future that\n> is noospherically stunted relative to what could have been; nor does it even\n> definitively preclude doom in the far future.\n\nOne criticism may be that there are too many accelerationisms as it is, and\nthat it is cringe to add to their number. Is accelerating biological\nintelligence really worth delineating from biotech accelerationism (b/acc) or\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s d/acc (defense, decentralization, democracy and\ndifferential)? Now I am highly sympathetic to both - more so, at any rate,\nthan e/acc, which basically amounts to Leeroy Jenkinsing into AGI\u2019s maws and\nhoping that Based Beff Jezos\u2019 thermodynamic gods bail you out. However, I\nthink that b/acc is too narrow and specific - removing regulatory barriers to\ndrug approval is great, but it probably won\u2019t revolutionize the world just by\nitself. Meanwhile, d/acc is so broad that is barely actionable - more of a\n\u201cvibe\u201d than an ideology - though in fairness, that is not a criticism, since\nthat is kind of its point (see decentralization).\n\nNooceleration is envisioned as something both incredibly ambitious in its\nvision, specific on what it perceives as most immediately important (human\nintelligence enhancement), and concretely practical in step-by-step\nimplementation. Let\u2019s start with the former.\n\n###\n\nProcreative Beneficence\n\nAt the Individual level, my view is simple: In so far as The Tech is within\nour grasp, not actively actualizing it out of bioconservative considerations\nborne of religious obscurantism or the Leftist politics of envy deprives\nfuture individuals of better and more interesting lives. As such, it is\nunethical; and to the extent that any outright restriction infringes on\nindividual freedoms and bodily autonomy, it is pathological.\n\nNow to be sure, there are plausible future tradeoffs and dilemmas so far as\nthe wider field of human enhancement is concerned, which are extensively\ndiscussed in Jonathan Anomaly\u2019s foundational book Creating Future People. One\nsuch dilemma may involve a clash between the ethical principle of procreative\nbeneficence, which is the view that parents should select the child\ngenetically expected to have the best possible life, as argued by Julian\nSavulescu29; and the orthogonal principle of \u201cprocreative altruism\u201d, which\nemphasizes that there\u2019s a greater obligation for the chosen child to\ncontribute more to the general welfare than any alternative child30. This\nmostly relates to aspects of personality such as altruism, which is very good\nfor society as a whole, but detrimental at the individual level in so far as\npathological altruists can be exploited by free riders. Furthermore, if too\nmany parents decide to select for social parasitism out of selfish individual\ninterests, this will eventually result in a society in which the optimal game\ntheory move is always mutual defection - a very subpar outcome for everyone\ninvolved. These are all major ethical conundrums that we will have to spend a\nlot of time thinking about when they become relevant.\n\nBut that time is still a long ways off. Meanwhile, so far as intelligence is\nconcerned, there are no such tradeoffs. More intelligence is better for both\nthe individual and society under any plausibly conceivable circumstances.\nConsequently, to the extent that arguments against human intelligence\nenhancement are raised, I find them to almost inevitably load on \u201ctruthy\u201d\nrhetoric to the effect that they undermine human dignity or presume to play\nGod. In this respect, there is a great deal of intersection with arguments\nagainst life extension, to which in my opinion the best response was given by\nPatrick Hayden: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve been hearing all my life about the Serious\nPhilosophical Issues posed by life extension, and my attitude has always been\nthat I\u2019m willing to grapple with those issues for as many centuries as it\ntakes.\u201d I would adopt a similar position with respect to human intelligence\nenhancement: \u201cThere are Serious Philosophical Issues posed by human\nintelligence enhancement, and my attitude is that I do not feel myself\nqualified to engage with them in the proper and constructive way that they\ndeserve without at least another dozen standard deviations in IQ.\u201d\n\n###\n\nHive Mind\n\nAt the National level, my basic view is that a world with no human\nintelligence enhancement will be a poorer, less functional, and more crime-\nridden one. As previously discussed, the causality mostly runs from low\nnational IQ to poverty, and not the other way round. One does not need to even\nget into the politically thorny genetics vs. environment debate over the\nprecise reason why national IQ gaps exist. Regardless of the precise balance\nbetween them, it\u2019s an unequivocal fact that human intelligence enhancement\nwill translate into a higher national IQ, a bigger \u201csmart fraction\u201d, and the\ndevelopment of an internationally competitive O-Ring sector that lifts all\nboats. As argued by Ives Parr in The Effective Altruist Case for Using Genetic\nEnhancement to End Poverty, it is the best and really only bet that\ndevelopment laggards with low national IQs have for future economic\nconvergence.\n\nIt is extremely hard to envision what kind of societies people much smarter\nthan us will create. The only systematic attempt to do this that I am aware of\nwas made by Alexander Turok in his 2018 book Posthumanity (available online).\nHowever, based on the limited surveys we have of very smart people, such as\nmembers of the Triple Nine Society (>150 IQ), we might suppose that such a\nsociety will be defined by economic libertarianism, social liberalism, extreme\nbioliberalism, cosmopolitanism, technophilia, and a commitment to rationalism\nthat rejects idpol traps such as Wokeness and right-wing identitarianisms.\nThis strikes me as a far more equitable and interesting society than our\npresent world with its primitive political discourse, bureaucratic\ndysfunction, and ethno-confessional identitarianisms.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that countries which insist on privileging\nbioconservative values will rapidly fall behind and become irrelevant once the\nposthuman revolution really gets going. In the present world, even modest\ndifferences in national IQ translate into yawning differences in wealth,\nfunction, and human accomplishment. Less than 10 IQ points separate\nMassachusetts, which hosts two of the world\u2019s top five universities, and West\nVirginia, which is a byword for poverty and opiate deaths. I will not even go\ninto the story of Jewish intellectual accomplishment. The important point is\nthat things will start to accelerate very quickly when superintelligent\nposthumans start entering the workforce at any substantive scale, and the\ncountries that play host to them are programmed to win our Civilization\nplaythrough31.\n\n###\n\nSolve Intelligence. Solve Everything Else.\n\nAt the Global level, a canceled or severely delayed nooceleration carries with\nit the risk of deeply suboptimal long-term outcomes.\n\n(1) If there is an Innovation Collapse before we get to an intelligence\nexplosion - regardless of whether it happens on silicon or carbon - then we\nmight be in for centuries of technological stagnation. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t\nmuch matter whether this stagnation is a Hansonian \u201cGreat Pause\u201d (perma-\nfertility slump x takeover by insular breeders) or my Age of Malthusian\nIndustrialism scenario (dysgenics x breeder gene saturation). Neither outcome\nis going to be a pleasant one for our descendants, who will spend centuries in\na world decidedly poorer, less equitable, and more stagnant than today\u2019s, let\nalone the one we could have built if we were smarter. And there is no\nguarantee that they will be any better placed to build utopia when\ntechnological progress does reignite.\n\n(2) If we fail to solve Radical Life Extension, then we banally die. That\u2019s\nthe end for us as individuals. (It\u2019s not even particularly likely that the\ncryonics centers keep functioning in regressed worlds). Consequently, human\nintelligence enhancement can be viewed as taking out a life insurance policy\nthe current crop of researchers failing to solve life extension. Consequently,\neven if Aubrey de Grey is wrong on his optimistic late 2030s timelines,\nperhaps our much smarter progeny will be sufficiently smart to finish the job\nin the 2050-60s.\n\n(3) If we fail to solve the Qualia Problem while proceeding to upload our\nminds or \u201cmerge with the machine\u201d anyway, then we could end up with a\nmechanical clockwork universe, its agents externally indistinguishable, but\nwith no inner world or light of consciousness within. The p-zombie universe\nwould be a strange apocalypse, but perhaps the saddest one: a \u201cDisneyland\nwithout children\u201d, as qualia philosopher Michael Johnson terms it.\n\n(4) If we unleash Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) before solving AI\nAlignment, there is a good chance that we all just die, and take the entirety\nof the biosphere and an indeterminately large sphere of local space-time with\nus. Even if the ASI is a unipolar \u201csingleton\u201d, there\u2019s no guarantees it ends\nup aligned with our interests. Even within our own species, delegating\nthinking and decision-making to agents who are smarter than us but who do not\nhave our interests close to heart has rarely worked out at either the\nindividual or the national level. And this, if anything, is the optimistic\nscenario - at least there\u2019s a chance, no matter how remote, that a unipolar\nASI will be a benevolent God.\n\nBut in my view, the likelier scenario is a massively multipolar ASI one. In\nlight of the near instantaneous and costless nature of digital reproduction,\nthis quickly devolves into AI Malthusianism, in which all readily available\nenergy is appropriated for compute. In such a world, there will be no room for\nthe biosphere - an acre of land can either support a farm that can feed a\nfamily, or a solar farm that can power millions of ASIs. Moreover, the\nindividual values and motivations of the ASI\u2019s under Malthusianism wouldn\u2019t\nactually matter! They can be as gracious, aesthetic, humanistic as you want,\nbut insofar as practicing altruism - i.e., subsidizing the biosphere -\nrequires surpluses, any such altruistic ASI\u2019s will be ruthlessly selected\nagainst and winnowed out extremely quickly. The main scenario in which we\nsurvive is if the ASI\u2019s collectively coordinate to subsidize the biosphere,\nand humans in particular. Considering that we will come off as plants with\nweak signs of intelligence to them, this is a bold assumption to say the\nleast, and I do not think it is likely to have a happy ending.\n\nNow to be sure, the probability estimates of \u201cdoom\u201d vary widely, and I realize\nthat far from all readers share my gloomy, quasi-Yudkowskian views. But\nregardless of your precise views on AI risk, I would nonetheless modestly\nventure that much smarter posthumans will be more aligned with us than what is\nfor all intents and purposes an alien species that will resemble a fantasy\ndeity at best, cyber gray goo at worst. Furthermore, I would posit that\nposthumans will more adept at safely navigating the emergence of ASI, or in\nthe event that they decide it cannot be safely pursued in principle, designing\nmechanisms to forestall it indefinitely without unduly infringing on civil\nliberties. And then \u201csolving the world\u201d without ASI.\n\nNow obviously, in the event that AI timelines are indeed very short, human\nintelligence enhancement - and pretty much everything else from life extension\nto the culture wars - is probably quite irrelevant. Though even in this case,\nEliezer Yudkowsky argues that a desperate crash program to enhance\nintelligence within existing adults is a worthwhile (dignified?) endeavor:\n\nEliezer Yudkowsky calls for crash nooceleration program.\n\nHowever, in the event that ASI is still decades away - at least the 2050s or\nlater - creating much smarter people would constitute an insurance policy\nagainst the current generation of AI alignment researchers not being smart\nenough to solve AI alignment, and the current world population not being smart\nenough to realize we should be spending 1,000x as much money on AI alignment.\nAnd in the highly improbable but not impossible scenario that machine\nsuperintelligence is impossible in principle, then that leaves biology as the\nonly option anyway.\n\n(5) So let\u2019s assume that we all make it (WAGMI). We successfully navigate all\nthe above civilizational pitfalls and existential risks, some of which we may\ncurrently not be smart enough to even conceptualize, let alone have any\ninkling as to what to do about. But even in this pollyannaish scenario, we\nwill still face the problem of what to do once we actually do solve all the\nother problems. At that point, we will have to answer the Final Question. What\nis there to do in a \u201csolved world\u201d - the \u201cDeep Utopia\u201d that Nick Bostrom\ndiscusses in his recent ponymous book? What is the meaning of life?How do we\ncompile our Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)?\n\nSophia the Redeemer.\n\nMy sub-posthuman intuition is that our posthuman descendants will soon tire of\nthe material plane. Interstellar space is just various permutations of rock,\ngases, and plasma, and its exploration will get boring fast, with our vast\ncorpus of space opera becoming nothing more than a retrofuturist curiosity.\nThe last epic voyages of posthumanity will take place in the cognitive and\npsychedelic realms - and to navigate them, we will need the most powerful\ncognitive engines possible. We will, in the Gnostic interpretation, need to\ninvoke the divine favor of Sophia, who in her role as wisdom deity serves\nhumanity as the intermediary between the fallen material world of the ignorant\nDemiurge, and the divine spiritual realm of the Pleroma to which we shall seek\nto return to.\n\n##\n\nThe Biosingularity is Near\n\nUp to this point, this essay has been about theory, but theory is useless\nwithout praxis. Enough with the glue huffing - let\u2019s move on to the germane\nquestions: Is there market demand for human intelligence enhancement? Is it\ntechnologically feasible? Is there money to be made? And what can you\npersonally do to accelerate nooceleration?\n\n###\n\nMarket Demand: Intelligence is Prestigious\n\nThe vast majority of First Worlders oppose embryo genetic editing for IQ. In\n2020, less than 20% of Europeans and Americans supported genetically editing\nbabies to make them more intelligent. (Stereotypes about \u201ctechnophile\u201d Chinese\naside, it wasn\u2019t actually that much higher in China, at just 23%). Although\nthis might sound depressingly modest, it nonetheless represents many tens of\nmillions of potential parents and customers.\n\nMoreover, due to the positive correlation between IQ and bioliberalism, it\nwill be the most progressive and moneyed potential parents expressing an\ninterest in human intelligence enhancement. Conversely, opposition to these\ntechnologies is concentrated amongst the highly religious, who cite ethical\nconcerns, as well as Leftists who are concerned about its intersections with\nmoneyed privilege and \u201cfascist\u201d eugenics. These are not good arguments, and\nneither of these two groups enjoy much prestige in advanced societies.\nFurthermore, even if individual countries do impose severe restrictions, they\nwill be systemically flouted. Those interested in the procedure will fly to\noffshore clinics in places like Pr\u00f3spera or Kolkata, and it will be precisely\nthe most privileged members of society - the \u201cglobalist elites\u201d, digital\nnomads, \u201ccrypto bros\u201d, and sundry Elite Human Capital - who will be in a\nposition to do that. Consequently, I do not expect the authoritarians to\ntriumph in the marketplace of ideas in most countries.\n\nOne additional observation is that the percentage of respondents expressing\nsupport for embryo gene editing for IQ was vastly higher in India - an\nastounding 64%. This may be part of a consistent pattern in which Third World\nnations are more technophile and techno-optimistic than the jaded denizens of\nthe already developed world. Bullish for Bharat!\n\nFinally, it also depends on how exactly you ask the question. The percentage\nof Americans supportive of embryo gene editing in order to increase their\nchild\u2019s chances of placing in a Top 100 university was 28% in a 2023 poll.\nThis is functionally equivalent to increasing IQ, but hey, normies will be\nnormies - nothing to be done about that (for now). Furthermore, the percentage\nof Americans willing to do embryo selection to increase their child\u2019s chances\ngetting into Harvard was 38% in 2023. This is the only mature reprogenetics\ntechnology, so again, we are talking gargantuan numbers of potential customers\nin absolute terms.\n\nBoth Jonathan Anomaly in Creating Future People and Alexander Turok in\nPosthumanity speculate that as the usage of reprogenetics technologies for\nintelligence enhancement becomes prevalent amongst the upper classes, it will\nacquire cachet and prestige, and filter down to the lower classes. After a\ndecade or two, not augmenting your progeny to have the best chance at life\nwill become looked down upon. Once that dam breaks, there will be no putting\nthis genie back in the bottle.\n\n###\n\nWAGMI\n\nIn light of the vast potential market for intelligence enhancement, I think\nit\u2019s safe to say there will be a lot of money on the table for bold startups\nand participants in this space.\n\nSo far as the sector as a whole is concerned, consider that even though\nsolving the intelligence problem enables you to solve all the other problems,\nand some technologies are reaching maturity, funding/interest is still very\nlow even by \u201cout there\u201d sector standards:\n\n  * Radical Life Extension: <1% NIH grants / ~2-3% VC funding as share of all biotech / ~1,000-2,000 full-time researchers?\n\n  * AI Alignment: 200 full-time researchers?\n\n  * Intelligence Enhancement: ~$10M market cap? 10-20 full-time researchers?\n\nIn the late 2010s, the life extension space underwent a Cambrian explosion,\nwith the creation of dozens of new companies propped up by a flood of venture\ncapital that would soon be joined by the speculative proceeds of the 2020-21\ncrypto boom. This was also when Aubrey de Grey\u2019s timelines became radically\nmore optimistic.\n\nI expect something similar to happen in the human intelligence enhancement\nspace in the late 2020s.\n\nThis will happen across a wide variety of approaches. Going from least to most\nspeculative, these include:\n\n  * Embryo selection for IQ\n\n  * Adult gene editing\n\n  * Embryo editing for IQ\n\n  * Iterated embryo selection\n\n  * Synthetic embryos\n\n  * De novo DNA synthesis\n\nThere are startups focused on at least four of these approaches that I know\nof, and active research on all six.\n\nIn the future, even more speculative approaches like transgenics, animal\nuplift, and cortical supercomputers are possible.\n\nAlternately, there\u2019s also the Deus Ex approach. Cybernetic enhancement has\nseen a resurgence of interest thanks to Neuralink\u2019s recent successes, and\nthere are new projects such as the Augmentation Lab popping up Pr\u00f3spera. I am\nsomewhat skeptical about the capacity of cybernetic augments to increase\nbiological intelligence at a fundamental level, but it is nonetheless\ncompletely aligned with nooceleration and worth tracking closely as well.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no more important task in the world than accelerating\nbiological intelligence, but we are not asking for charity or handouts to\naccomplish it. I expect some of the startups in the space to become bluechips\nin the 2030-40s. The collective goal is to solve intelligence, and then solve\nall the other problems, and make a lot of money in the process.\n\n###\n\nDon\u2019t Defy DeFi, Don\u2019t Deny DeSci\n\nOne of the most interesting developments in the crypto space, and a strong\nrefutation of claims that it is all a scam, is the emergence of Decentralized\nScience (DeSci).\n\nVincent Weisser (Molecule DAO) has a good definition:\n\n> Decentralized science is a movement that promotes open-source research in\n> order to create a more democratic and equitable scientific system. DeSci\n> allows for a more decentralized and distributed scientific research model,\n> making it more resistant to censorship and control by central authorities.\n> DeSci hopes to create an environment where new and unconventional ideas can\n> flourish by decentralizing access to funding, scientific tools, and\n> communication channels. The goal is to make science more open, collaborative\n> and accountable.\n\nTo realize these aspirations, DeSci uses blockchain and the DAO structure to\npractice transparent on-chain governance and funding allocation, incentivize\ncommunity participation through tokens and NFTs, and accelerate new\npublications and patents through Web3 primitives and reputation systems that\nretain the rigor of traditional scientific publishing while avoiding its\nbureaucratic rigmarole.\n\nOver the past few years, DeSci it has developed an impressive ecosystem of\nbiotech DAOs, accelerators, and protocols:\n\nThe state of #DeSci as of August 2023.\n\nOne of the first biotech DAOs was Vita DAO, which collects life extension-\nrelated IP-NFTs, funds prospective research in the space, organizes events to\npropagandize longevity and radical life extension, and has plans to offer\ndiscounts on longevity products for $VITA holders32. In the past few months,\nit has played a major role in organizing a start-up city called Vitalia in the\nfree market oasis of Pr\u00f3spera in Honduras. It aims to acquire its own district\nin Roat\u00e1n and to become a full-fledged network that has \u201cmaking death\noptional\u201d as its One Commandment.\n\nSince the founding of Vita DAO in 2021, it has been joined by a number of\nother biotech DAOs, including but not limited to Cryo DAO (cryonics), Athena\nDAO (women\u2019s reproductive health), Hair DAO (hair loss), Valley DAO (synthetic\nbiology), Psy DAO (psychedelics), and Cerebrum DAO (brain health).\n\n###\n\nThe Case for Sophia DAO\n\nI expect DeSci DAOs to grow in line with the expansion of the cryptosphere and\ngrowing dissatisfaction with legacy academic institutions. And I intend to\nmake sure that human intelligence enhancement doesn\u2019t miss this unique\nopportunity. Consequently, my primary goal right now is to build an analogous\nstructure for human intelligence enhancement: Sophia DAO.\n\nThere are several reasons why I consider the DAO structure to be perfectly\nsuited for human intelligence enhancement research. First, it has\n\u201ctranshumanist\u201d vibes, which repels normie academia - there\u2019s a reason that\nthe first prominent biotech DAO happened in life extension, and that many of\nthe other prominent DeSci DAOs are in \u201cout there\u201d fields such as cryonics and\npsychedelics. Second, intelligence enhancement is unusually controversial,\nsince it is at the intersection of not just transhumanism but also with Far\nRight ideologies which it is inaccurately associated with33. This is an issue\nin the traditional business world, where social status and\n\u201chandshakeworthiness\u201d plays a major role, but not really much of one in the\ncryptosphere. People who were early to Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to the\nextreme intellectual openness, curiosity, and non-conformism that characterize\nthe \u201cCoffee Salon\u201d cultures that historically accounted for a disproportionate\nshare of innovation and new intellectual currents. Third, I expect the human\nintelligence enhancement sector to benefit from an approach-agnostic actor\nthat can sponsor fundamental research and public goods that benefits the\nentire space, provision access to prospective companies for crypto investors\ninstead of just leaving it all to the VCs, offer benefits and discounts for\nstakers, and promote nooceleration and reprogenetics technology in blogs and\nmedia.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the banal fact that despite what I consider its importance,\nnobody else seems to be interested in doing this. So in so far as I believe\nwhat I say it is incumbent upon me to take up this project. As someone with a\nbackground in blogging, intelligence research, community management, and\nreasonably fair knowledge of the cryptocurrency and transhumanism space, I am\nprobably not even the absolute worst candidate for this role.\n\nYou can follow updates by signing up to the Sophia DAO newsletter and\nfollowing it on X.\n\nI aim to soon open up a Discord as part of community building.\n\nI will also continue exploring aspects of nooceleration here. Otherwise, I can\nalso recommend the following aligned blogs:\n\n  * Parrhesia\n\nby Ives Parr\n\n  * The Genetic Choice Project\n\nby Craig Willy\n\n  * Aporia\n\nby Noah Carl & Bo Winegard\n\nMy other main goal for this year is to expand this post into a full-fledged\nbook, provisionally titled The Biosingularity: The Case for Human Intelligence\nEnhancement. This will be an opportunity to elegantly integrate all the\nvarious ideas I have had on this topic over the years including Apollo\u2019s\nAscent, The Age of Malthusian Industrialism, and my various other\ntranshumanism-adjacent musings from animal rights to existential risks.\n\n###\n\nOn to the Biosingularity!\n\n> Imagine the singularity happens but on a biological substrate. Big Brain\n> uplifted whales and elephants, world-spanning cortical forests, conscious\n> oceans as on Solaris... \u201ctransparent tigers and towers of blood.\u201d - Anatoly\n> Karlin.\n\nPS.

However, as is\nusually the case with geopolitical phase transitions, the road is likely to be\nrocky, and traumatic for those peoples and polities that make the wrong\nchoices. Consequently, nationalists who want the best of their people should\nlogically push for nooceleration no less assiduously than transhumanist\nglobalists.
