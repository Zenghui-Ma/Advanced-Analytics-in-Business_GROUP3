This engine provides a flexible\nframework for running and visualizing complex cellular automata simulations in\na 3D environment.\n\n### Rules\n\n  * A live cell that has live neighbors below 5 or above 6 dies.\n  * A dead cell that has 4 live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n\n### Features\n\n  * Infinite Grid: No grid size limitation.\n  * Conway's Game of Life: CAEngine is specifically designed to run Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton with simple rules but complex emergent behavior.\n  * 3D Simulation: Unlike traditional implementations which are 2D, CAEngine operates in a three-dimensional space, allowing for more intricate patterns and interactions.\n  * Flexible Architecture: The engine is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and customize for different cellular automaton rules and behaviors.\n  * Visualization: CAEngine includes built-in visualization tools to observe the evolution of the cellular automaton in real-time, providing insights into the emergent patterns and dynamics.\n  * Configurability: Users can adjust various parameters such as initial configurations, and simulation speed to tailor the behavior of the cellular automaton to their specific needs.\n  * Cross-Platform: CAEngine is designed to be cross-platform, ensuring compatibility with various operating systems.\n\n### Controls\n\nKey| Action  \n---|---  \nWASD| Move  \nRMB| Rotate camera  \n  \n### License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
