But apparently not. The new Irish Taoiseach, Simon Harris, is\ndetermined to railroad through the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or\nHatred and Hate Offences) Bill, Donald Tusk\u2019s government in Poland wants to\nintroduce a new law that would make it a criminal offence to \u2018defame\u2019 a member\nof the LGBT community and Justin Trudeau is pressing ahead with an Online\nHarms Bill that makes our own Online Safety Act seem like the First Amendment.\nIt\u2019s as if all these \u2018liberal\u2019 leaders are saying: \u2018You think Humza Yousaf is\nthe West\u2019s foremost opponent of free speech? Hold my beer.\u2019\n\nThe Canadian proposal is, by some distance, the worst. It\u2019s so dystopian, even\nGeorge Orwell and Philip K. Dick failed to anticipate it. Discrimination is\nalready banned under the Canadian Human Rights Act, but the new law will\nexpand the definition of \u2018discrimination\u2019 to include online speech \u2018likely to\nfoment detestation or vilification of an individual or group\u2019. To those\nworrywarts who are anxious about the risk that this new law might be\nweaponised by woke activists, the government has said that \u2018detestation\u2019 and\n\u2018vilification\u2019 are not the same as \u2018disdain\u2019 or \u2019dislike\u2019, which will still be\npermitted (thank you, Mr Trudeau), or speech that \u2018discredits, humiliates,\nhurts or offends\u2019.\n\n> In Canada the authorities will be able to place people under house arrest\n> for \u2018hateful\u2019 things they haven\u2019t said\n\nWhich raises the question: who gets to decide what speech falls foul of this\nnew standard? And what qualifies them to make these Solomon-like judgments,\nparsing the difference between \u2018dislike\u2019 (acceptable) and \u2018detest\u2019 (verboten)?\nThat job will fall to a new national agency called the Digital Safety\nCommission, comprised of five commissioners and an army of bureaucratic\nbusybodies, which will have the same powers as a federal court, save for the\nfact that it won\u2019t be bound by \u2018any technical or legal rules of evidence\u2019.\n(Points to Kafka for anticipating that.)\n\nUnder the bill, anyone can accuse you of the \u2018communication of hate speech\u2019\nand if the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal finds you guilty it can order you to\npay up to $20,000 to \u2018any victim\u2019 and $50,000 to the state (on pain of\nimprisonment). No limit on how many times a malefactor can be ordered to pay\nthese fines, obviously, so bankruptcy looms for Jordan Peterson. And it isn\u2019t\njust stuff you\u2019ve posted after the new law comes into force you can get into\ntrouble for \u2013 oh, no \u2013 but anything you\u2019ve posted, ever, dating back to the\ndawn of the internet. In other words, it\u2019s a gold-embossed invitation to\noffence archaeologists to do their worst, with the prospect of a $20,000\nreward if they hit paydirt. The only way to protect yourself is to go through\nall your social media accounts and painstakingly delete anything remotely\ncontroversial you\u2019ve ever said.\n\n### Most popular\n\n#### Lee Cohen\n\n##### Dear Britain, please take Prince Harry back\n\nAlthough, that won\u2019t protect you from another clause in the bill \u2013 and this is\nwhere it trips over into as yet unimagined dystopian territory. If the courts\nbelieve you are likely to commit a \u2018hate crime\u2019 or disseminate \u2018hate\npropaganda\u2019 (not defined), you can be placed under house arrest and your\nability to communicate with others restricted. That is, a court can force you\nto wear an ankle bracelet, prevent you using any of your communication devices\nand then instruct you not to leave the house. If the court believes there\u2019s a\nrisk you may get drunk or high and start tweeting under the influence \u2013\nalthough how is unclear, given you can\u2019t use your phone or a PC \u2013 it can order\nyou to submit regular urine samples to the authorities. Anyone who refuses to\ncomply with these diktats can be sent to prison.\n\nPretty extraordinary, no? Margaret Atwood, who\u2019s no slouch when it comes to\ndystopian satire, describes the bill as \u2018Orwellian\u2019, but even the Thought\nPolice in Oceania didn\u2019t punish people for things they might say rather than\nthings they\u2019d said. This is more reminiscent of Philip K. Dick\u2019s Minority\nReport, except in that novel the police only arrest people they think are\nabout to commit serious crimes like murder and only after a suspect has been\nidentified by a \u2018precog\u2019 who can literally see the future. In Trudeau\u2019s\nCanada, by contrast, the authorities will shortly be able to place people\nunder house arrest for \u2018hateful\u2019 things they haven\u2019t yet said on the say-so of\na police \u2018intelligence\u2019 officer. If that\u2019s the future, God help us.\n\nI think the time has come to set up a Canadian Free Speech Union.
