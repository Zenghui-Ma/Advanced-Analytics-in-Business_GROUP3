They were cool in temperament. They were not\ntouchy-feely. And they, I think, had high expectations for their children,\"\nBreslin says.\n\nThe preschool was exclusive, with a long waitlist, and her parents \"thought it\nwould be cool to have me enrolled [and] involved in something important\", she\nsays.\n\nThey thought they were setting their daughter off on a path of exceptionalism.\n\n\"My principal investigators were benevolent; they wanted to enlighten\nhumanity. They were sort of working in service of the greater good. That's why\nthey were collecting our data. That's why they were studying us,\" Breslin\nsays.\n\n\"And the cost was we didn't have a private life of our own.\"\n\n## 'Somebody on the other side of the mirror'\n\nIn the 1960s, American psychologists Jack and Jeanne Block developed a\nlongitudinal study to observe how personality traits and cognition develop\nover the course of a lifetime.\n\n\"The only way to find [that] out was to gather together a group of kids and\nstudy them from childhood and into adulthood,\" Breslin explains.\n\nShe was one of 128 children recruited.\n\nOne of her earliest memories of the preschool is being in a room with\nactivities like puzzles and toy animals, playing games with an adult she later\nlearned was testing and studying her, and observing her interactions with\nother children.\n\nBreslin recalls playing games in her preschool's experiment room, and only\nlater realised she was being tested.(Image courtesy of Susannah Breslin)\n\nOnce she'd left the preschool for primary school, Breslin was routinely\nbrought back to the university at key developmental stages, where researchers\nwould capture data from IQ, personality and other tests.\n\nThey would assess her report cards. They would ask her about her life.\n\nDuring one of these sessions, when she was seven years old, Breslin recalls an\nincredible moment.\n\nShe was in a room with a researcher who had placed a bowl of lollies between\nthe two of them.\n\n\"The examiner was asking me all these questions about myself and then at one\npoint he said, 'Would you like some candy?'\"\n\nThe young Breslin wondered if this might be a kind of test, so she refused the\noffer. Soon after, the examiner said he needed to leave for a minute but would\nbe right back.\n\nAs soon as he walked out of the room, Breslin jumped across the table and\nlunged for the bowl, accidentally knocking it over in the process.\n\n\"I started grabbing the candy and shoving it in my mouth, hoping I wasn't\ngoing to get in trouble for making a mess,\" she says.\n\n\"And then for some reason I looked \u2014 I remember this very distinctly \u2014 into\nthis mirror that was on the wall. And I could see and feel my cheeks turning\npink, and I sensed that there was somebody on the other side of the mirror\nwatching me.\n\n\"And in fact, that was a one-way mirror, and somebody was on the other side,\nspying on me.\"\n\n## Study 'like a third parent'\n\nWhen Breslin got older and found out about the study, she was in two minds\nabout the realisation she was being observed.\n\n\"On the one hand, I liked it. My parents were distant, they were busy, they\nwere preoccupied with their careers ... and their marriage was falling apart.\n\n\"When I was in an experiment room at the university, it was exactly what I\nwanted. I was the centre of attention. And they were interested in nothing but\nme.\"\n\n### Stream your favourite shows on the free ABC listen app\n\nDr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and\naudiobooks ... and you don\u2019t need to be a scientist to find it!\n\nRead more\n\nThe idea that Breslin was important, that she mattered and that someone cared\nwere not messages she was getting at home, she says.\n\n\"At the same time, I think I felt a lot of pressure to perform at some high\nlevel; that I was supposed to prove to [the researchers] that I was\nexceptional. And if I didn't, maybe I wouldn't be able to come back again.\"\n\nThe study \"was kind of like a third parent\", she says.\n\nResearchers served as confidants. Breslin told them more secrets than she told\nher parents.\n\n\"The researchers were interested in the things that I was going through. They\nwere interested in whether or not we were using drugs, they were interested in\nhow our parents' divorces were affecting us. And I told them things that I\ndidn't tell anyone else.\n\n\"I have this idea that this study potentially knew me better than I knew\nmyself.\"\n\n## Humans more than a 'mathematical equation'\n\nToday Breslin is an investigative journalist, and recently wrote a book about\nher experience being studied, Data Baby: My Life in a Psychological\nExperiment.\n\nThe process of writing that helped her to understand just how much she\ndivulged over the course of the study.\n\n\"You kind of surrender your life story to somebody else ... I was unsure if I\nwas the author of the story of my life, or if someone else was,\" she says.\n\n## More stories from All in the Mind:\n\n  * Does intuition really exist and if so, when should we follow it?\n  * There's a common trait among people with eating disorders, but many don't know about it\n  * Ettie fell over and is still feeling the impact of concussion 18 months later\n\n\"In my opinion, my principal investigators believed that a person was the sum\ntotal of their data; that a human being was the answer to a mathematical\nequation, and if you could just make the right calculation or perform the\nright analysis or extract the correct amount of data, you could understand\nthat person.\n\n\"And I think that is wrong. I think that there is something about people that\ngoes beyond that; that there is a certain essential nature to people that is\nimpossible to quantify.\"\n\nYet, Breslin credits the study for her life today.\n\n\"I have struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. And I do wonder\nif I hadn't been studied and I hadn't had [it] in my life, that the outcome\nfor me might have been much bleaker; that I might have killed myself or gotten\ninvolved in something dangerous that I couldn't get myself out of.\n\n\"So while it was certainly complicated to be studied, I think ultimately it\nrescued me from a worse fate.\"\n\nBreslin's final contact with the researchers was in 1999, at the age of 32.\n\nSince then, she says she's been forced \"to construct my own narrative and\ndecide for myself who I am, rather than entrusting that task to somebody\nelse\".\n\n### RN in your inbox\n\nGet more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.\n\nYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy\nCollection Statement.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nPosted 3h ago3 hours agoMon 22 Apr 2024 at 10:00pm\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Child Health and Behaviour\n  * Children\n  * Community and Society\n  * Family and Relationships\n  * Human Interest\n  * Science and Technology\n  * United States\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Bruce Lehrmann refused offer to settle defamation action with Ten before trial began, court documents reveal\n\n  * ### On a patch of earth 'big as a Bunnings car park', renters get to muscle in on the solar boom\n\n  * ### Supermarket promotional labels accused of 'confusing' and 'potentially misleading' shoppers\n\n  * ### 'While salacious, does not matter': Porn star's claim under courtroom scrutiny as jurors hear openings in Trump's trial\n\n  * ### 'I want to see more bleeding': Inside Australia's underworld, where violence regulates the drugs trade\n\n  * ### After 101 treks across the Kokoda Track, one guide says it's too full of 'death traps' to go back\n\n  * ### 'It felt too difficult to do my job': ABC journalist targeted by Indian government over her reporting\n\n  * ### 'Ego, arrogance': PM responds to Elon Musk's comments goading him\n\n  * ### Has Labor banked 88 per cent of budget revenue upgrades compared to the Coalition's 40 per cent?\n\n  * ### Comedy figure says it should be 'a given' that babies aren't brought to gigs, after show ejection sparks debate\n\n  * ### 'Nothing short of horrifying': Rental affordability in Australia the worst it's ever been, report says\n\n  * live\n\n### ASX opens higher after positive session on Wall Street overnight\n\n  * ### 'A total s***show': Companies losing money after being locked out of Facebook and Instagram\n\n  * ### Lily, 11, was playing in a park when fire ants swarmed her body\n\n  * ### Astronaut life 'absolutely as fun as you can imagine', Australian-first graduate tells kids\n\n## Popular Now\n\n1.\n\n### Bruce Lehrmann refused offer to settle defamation action with Ten before\ntrial began, court documents reveal\n\n2.\n\n### 'While salacious, does not matter': Porn star's claim under courtroom\nscrutiny as jurors hear openings in Trump's trial\n\n3.\n\n### On a patch of earth 'big as a Bunnings car park', renters get to muscle in\non the solar boom\n\n4.\n\n### Comedy figure says it should be 'a given' that babies aren't brought to\ngigs, after show ejection sparks debate\n\n5.\n\n### Supermarket promotional labels accused of 'confusing' and 'potentially\nmisleading' shoppers\n\n6.\n\n### After 101 treks across the Kokoda Track, one guide says it's too full of\n'death traps' to go back\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  1. ### Bruce Lehrmann refused offer to settle defamation action with Ten before trial began, court documents reveal\n\n  2. ### On a patch of earth 'big as a Bunnings car park', renters get to muscle in on the solar boom\n\n  3. ### Supermarket promotional labels accused of 'confusing' and 'potentially misleading' shoppers\n\n  4. ### 'While salacious, does not matter': Porn star's claim under courtroom scrutiny as jurors hear openings in Trump's trial\n\n  5. ### 'I want to see more bleeding': Inside Australia's underworld, where violence regulates the drugs trade\n\n## Just In\n\n  * ### Pro-China party wins Maldives election in a result likely to strain ties with traditional partner India\n\n29m ago29 minutes agoTue 23 Apr 2024 at 12:35am\n\n  * ### Struggling to breathe and 'really out of it', baby Isabelle's RSV trauma prompts a mother's warning\n\n36m ago36 minutes agoTue 23 Apr 2024 at 12:28am\n\n  * ### Bruce Lehrmann refused offer to settle defamation action with Ten before trial began, court documents reveal\n\n37m ago37 minutes agoTue 23 Apr 2024 at 12:27am\n\n  * ### Victorian government scraps plans for a second supervised injecting room in Melbourne\n\n53m ago53 minutes agoTue 23 Apr 2024 at 12:11am\n\nMore Just In\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Editorial Policies\n  * Accessibility\n  * Help\n  * Contact Us\n  * About the ABC\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * \u00a9 2024 ABC\n\n", "frontpage": true}
