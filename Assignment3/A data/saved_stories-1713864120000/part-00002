Relatives of the detained journalists told CPJ that many were allegedly\nimprisoned due to their activity on social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThis is the highest number of media arrests in Israel and the Palestinian\nterritories since CPJ began tracking imprisonments in 1992,\u201d Naomi Zeveloff,\nCPJ\u2019s features editor, wrote in January. \u201cThe steep increase underscores just\nhow dangerous the Israel-Gaza war is for journalists across the Palestinian\nterritories.\u201d\n\nOne of the detained journalists, Alaa al-Rimawi, was undergoing a medical\nexamination when Israeli forces raided his home and detained his son to\npressure al-Rimawi to turn himself in.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nCulture & Media\n\n## Israel Must Allow Foreign Journalists Entry to Gaza, UN Secretary General\nSays\n\n\u201cDenying international journalists entry into Gaza is allowing disinformation\nand false narratives to flourish.\u201d\n\nBy\n\n    Zane McNeill ,\n    Truthout\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\n\u201cAs you know, the occupation, in time of its war on Gaza, now wants the\njournalistic and media voice to be absent,\u201d al-Rimawi said to his TikTok\nfollowers before reporting to prison. \u201cI apologize, I apologize because I may\nnot be with you in this coverage and convey your pain, wounds, and victory,\nwith God\u2019s help.\u201d\n\nIn October, al-Rimawi covered the start of Israel\u2019s bombardment and invasion\nof Gaza on J-Media, a West Bank-based news agency he directed, as well as on\nTikTok and Facebook. Within two weeks of the start of the war on Gaza, Israel\nbanned J-Media and arrested multiple J-Media contributors, including Belal\nArman, Moath Amarneh, Mustafa al-Khawaja and Sabri Jibril.\n\n\u201cAll those known to be held by Israel as of CPJ\u2019s December 1 census date were\narrested in the Palestinian territory of the occupied West Bank after the\nstart of the Israel-Gaza war on October 7,\u201d the CPJ report says. \u201cMost are\nheld in administrative detention, which allows Israeli authorities to hold\ndetainees without charge on the grounds that they suspect the detainee of\nplanning to commit a future offense.\u201d\n\nIn tandem with jailing reporters, Israel has also killed at least 97\njournalists and media workers since October 7. A total of more than 34,000\nPalestinians have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank by Israel since the\nstart of the genocide.\n\n\u201cSince the Israel-Gaza war began, journalists have been paying the highest\nprice \u2014 their lives \u2014 to defend our right to the truth. Each time a journalist\ndies or is injured, we lose a fragment of that truth,\u201d CPJ Program Director\nCarlos Mart\u00ednez de la Serna said. \u201cJournalists are civilians who are protected\nby international humanitarian law in times of conflict. Those responsible for\ntheir deaths face dual trials: one under international law and another before\nhistory\u2019s unforgiving gaze.\u201d\n\nPress advocates believe that the arrests and targeted killing of journalists\nis part of a larger project by Israel to conceal the events unfolding in Gaza.\nSince the start of the genocide, foreign correspondents have only been allowed\ninto Palestine if they are accompanied by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF),\nprompting the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the\nForeign Press Association to demand that foreign journalists be allowed access\nto Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe barring of independent press access to a war zone for this long is\nunprecedented for Israel,\u201d the Foreign Press Association said in a letter\nearlier this month. \u201cIt raises questions about what Israel does not want\ninternational journalists to see.\u201d\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
