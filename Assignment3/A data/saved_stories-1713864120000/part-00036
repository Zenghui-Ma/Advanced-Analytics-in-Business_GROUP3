It is frustrating when the experience is marred by an easy\nmistake to avoid - visually ambiguous characters.\n\n## What are visually ambiguous characters?\n\n  * O / 0 - The letter O and the number 0 can look very similar, especially in fonts where the number zero isn\u2019t slashed or dotted.\n  * I / l / 1 - The letter I (uppercase i), lowercase l (L), and the number 1 can be indistinguishable in many types of print.\n  * 5 / S - In some fonts, the number 5 and the letter S can appear quite similar.\n  * 2 / Z - These can also be confused with each other, particularly in handwritten forms.\n  * 8 / B - These characters might be mixed up when poorly written or in certain stylized fonts.\n  * 6 / G - These characters can be confused in some fonts.\n  * 9 / q / g - These characters can be confused in some fonts.\n\n## Why are visually ambiguous characters a problem?\n\nThey cause confusion and errors in data entry, especially when the characters\nare handwritten or when the font is not clear. For example, if a user is\ntrying to enter a code that contains the letter 'O' and the number '0', they\nmight not be able to tell which character is which. This leads to frustrating\nuser experiences.\n\nA few examples using different system fonts:\n\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (ariel)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (helvetica)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (courier)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (times)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (verdana)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (georgia)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (tahoma)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (impact)\n  * 9qg6G8B2Z5SIl10O (comic sans)\n\nSome pairs are visually ambiguous in all fonts (e.g. I and l), while others\nare much harder to distinguish in handwritten forms, e.g. try writing 9qg in\nyour own handwriting.\n\n## When it matters?\n\nAny time that the ID might need to be communicated verbally or written down,\ne.g.\n\n  * Customer support\n  * Discount codes\n  * Tracking codes\n  * Error IDs\n  * Product IDs\n  * etc.\n\n## Deciding between case sensitivity\n\nYou may also consider whether your IDs should be case-sensitive or not. Is abc\nthe same as ABC?\n\nAssuming that you are going with case sensitivity, you have 53 characters to\nchoose from (adjusted for visually ambiguous characters). On the other hand,\nif you decide to make your IDs case-insensitive, you have only 23 characters\nto choose from.\n\nAssuming an ID length of 5 characters, you have the following number of\npossible IDs:\n\n  * Case-sensitive: 53^5 = 418,195,493\n  * Case-insensitive: 23^5 = 6,436,343\n\nHowever, as the number of members in the set increases, the number of possible\nIDs increases exponentially.\n\n  * Case-sensitive: 53^5 = 62,259,690,411,360\n  * Case-insensitive: 23^8 = 78,310,985,281\n\nTherefore, the real question is whether what's preferable is a shorter ID with\na higher chance of visual ambiguity or a longer ID with a lower chance of\nvisual ambiguity.\n\n## Visually unambiguous dictionary\n\nAs my preference is readability, this is the character set that I use for\ngenerating IDs in my projects:\n\n    \n    \n    [ \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", \"p\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\" ]\n\n## Further considerations: phonetic similarity\n\nIn some cases, you might also want to avoid characters that sound similar when\nspoken. For example, b and p can sound similar when spoken out loud. This can\nbe especially important in situations where IDs are communicated verbally.\n\n  * \u2b05\ufe0e Back to Blog\n  * Newsletter\n  * Report an issue\n\n", "frontpage": true}
