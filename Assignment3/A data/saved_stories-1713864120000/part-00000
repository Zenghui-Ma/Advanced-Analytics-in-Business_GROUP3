Hsu, author of Air Conditioning\n\nBecause they were available long before artificial cooling, heating\ntechnologies are at the center of many early Western writings that reflect the\ncultural underpinnings of thermal comfort and air conditioning. Among the most\neloquent examples of ambient temperature as a precondition for thought is the\nlittle-known story of Descartes\u2019s stove. In his Discourse on Method, published\nin 1637, the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes recalls spending the night of November\n10, 1619, alone in a quiet po\u00eale\u2014a room heated by a stove, to which he had\nretreated from the onset of winter. Here, he writes, \u201cI was completely free to\nconverse with myself about my thoughts.\u201d That night, Descartes had three\ndreams: in the first, a strong wind forced him against a church; in the\nsecond, he witnessed a light-filled vision in a room while a storm raged\noutside; and in the third, he sat at his desk and read in an encyclopedia Quod\nvitae sectabor iter? [\u201cWhat road shall I follow in this life?\u201d]. The young\nphilosopher interpreted these dreams as a sign that he should devote his life\nto unifying the sciences, and he would subsequently attempt this by creating\nanalytic geometry and by developing a philosophical method grounded in\nrationality\u2014one that he believed would render us \u201cmasters and possessors of\nnature.\u201d[1]\n\nBoth of Descartes\u2019s innovations are steeped in dualism, or the belief that the\nmind is distinct from the body. Analytic geometry represents space as a vacuum\noriented by abstract coordinates and occasionally inhabited by bodies, not as\nan atmosphere already filled with airborne materials of varying composition,\ndensity, temperature, and velocity. The stove-heated room offered Descartes a\nvision of thought isolated from climate: across his three dreams, he becomes\nincreasingly sheltered from the storm outside as he comes closer to\ndiscovering his life\u2019s work. Only under conditions of climate control could\nDescartes begin creating a philosophy grounded in the fiction that the mind\ncould be disentangled from the thinking, breathing body\u2014a body sensitive to\natmospheric factors like air quality and ambient temperature. This fiction is\nrefuted by the etymology of \u201ctemperature\u201d: derived from the Latin for\n\u201cmixture,\u201d temperature suggests a body that is blended with its surroundings.\nHow would our understanding of Enlightenment philosophy and its legacies\nchange if we revised Descartes\u2019s famous proposition, I think, therefore I am,\nto reflect the thermal conditions of a particular approach to thinking: I\nthink in a stove-heated room, therefore I am? Or, perhaps, I think my mind is\ndistinct, therefore I am in a climate-controlled room?\n\nWhy have philosophers had so little to say about Descartes\u2019s stove, and so\nmuch to say about his dreams, his resolve, and his conception of analytic\ngeography on that winter\u2019s night? Suppressing the agency of the stove makes it\neasier to tell a simple story about the agency of the individual thinker. But\nit has made it that much harder to discern the subtle yet powerful ways in\nwhich modern air conditioning technologies condition thought, culture, and\nsocial experience. While researchers have devoted considerable attention to\nimproving AC technology and studying optimal indoor temperatures, we know\ncomparatively little about the implications of the variable availability of\nair conditioning across time and space for psychology, health, culture, and\nsocioeconomic inequality. How do air quality and ambient temperature affect\npeople\u2019s moods, relationships, and work experiences? Their life chances? What\nkinds of thoughts or feelings are enabled by comfortable temperatures, and\nwhat thoughts or feelings might be hindered by such comfort?\n\nDescartes\u2019s suppressed dependence on the stove provokes the question at the\nheart of my book, Air Conditioning: how have social relations, culture, and\neveryday experiences been quietly shaped by air-conditioning technologies that\nmodify indoor temperatures in some places while intensifying the effects of\nclimate change elsewhere? This question approaches air conditioning not only\nas a technology for cooling the air, but more generally as a process that\nconditions human beings by conditioning the air we inhabit. Understanding the\nair conditioner as an object requires an approach that, like air conditioner\nemissions, radiates outward\u2014one that follows the consequences of air\nconditioners not only for the interiors they cool, but for what the novelist\nMohsin Hamid calls \u201cthe great uncooled\u201d: the vast populations worldwide with\nlittle or no access to cooled air, and all too much access to its\nenvironmental consequences.\n\n^[1] Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy,\ntrans.
