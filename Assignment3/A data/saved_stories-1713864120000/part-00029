The decision could\nhave sweeping implications for the record number of people living in tents and\ncars, and the cities and states struggling to manage them.\n\nThe Supreme Court had declined to hear a similar case out of Boise, Idaho, in\n2019. But since then rates of homelessness have spiked. An annual federal\ncount found more than 250,000 people living in parks, on streets, and in their\nvehicles. Sprawling street encampments have grown larger and expanded to new\nplaces, igniting intense backlash from residents and businesses.\n\nThe current case centers on the small city of Grants Pass, Ore., which has a\npopulation just under 40,000 and is a symbol of just how widespread the\nhomelessness problem has become. A slew of other cities and states \u2014 led by\nDemocrats and Republicans alike \u2014 urged the justices to take up this issue.\n\n### Cities say the courts have hamstrung efforts to address homelessness\n\nIn both the Boise and Grants Pass cases, lower courts said that under the\nEighth Amendment it's cruel and unusual to fine or jail someone for sleeping\non public land if there's no adequate shelter available. But Grants Pass and\nmany other cities across the West say those rulings have tied their hands as\nthey try to keep their public spaces open and safe for everyone.\n\n### Shots - Health News\n\n### Why homeless people are losing health coverage in Medicaid mix-ups\n\n### Migrant surge, homelessness testing Denver's new mayor\n\nGrants Pass has no public shelter. But its local law essentially banned people\nfrom sleeping with a blanket or pillow on any public land, at any time.\n\nDuring Monday's arguments, the Supreme Court's more liberal justices suggested\nthis amounts to unlawfully targeting people simply because they're homeless.\n\"You don't arrest babies who have blankets over them. You don't arrest people\nwho are sleeping on the beach,\" said Justice Sotomayor.\n\nJustice Kagan said sleeping is not a criminal act. \"Sleeping is a biological\nnecessity. It's sort of like breathing. ... But I wouldn't expect you to\ncriminalize breathing in public.\"\n\nBut the court's conservative justices said it can be hard to draw the line\nbetween someone's conduct \u2014 which can be legally punished \u2014 and a status they\nare unable to change \u2014 which cannot be punished. \"How about if there are no\npublic bathroom facilities?\" Justice Gorsuch asked. \"Do people have an Eighth\nAmendment right to defecate and urinate? Is that conduct or is that status?\"\n\nOver and over, conservative justices also said homelessness is a complex\npolicy problem and questioned whether courts like theirs should \"micromanage\"\nit.\n\n\"Why would you think that these nine people are the best people to judge and\nweigh those policy judgments?\" Chief Justice Roberts asked.\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nDemonstrators rally outside City Hall in Grants Pass, Ore., on March 20.

The\nself-proclaimed \"park watch\" group opposes public drug use in homeless\nencampments.\n\nJenny Kane/AP\n\n### Whatever the decision, this case won't solve the homelessness problem\n\nStates and cities across the U.S. have struggled to manage record rates of\nhomelessness. Some in the West have found ways to limit encampments and even\nclear them out without running afoul of the 9th Circuit rulings. Elsewhere,\nseveral states have taken a more sweeping approach with camping bans.\nFlorida's governor recently signed a law that seeks to move unhoused people\noff public property altogether and into government-run encampments.\n\nSome worry that a decision in favor of Grants Pass will lead to more such\nmoves or even a worst-case scenario of a \"banishment race\" if communities seek\nto push people out of their jurisdiction. Justice Sotomayor raised that\nconcern during the arguments.\n\n\"Where do we put them if every city, every village, every town lacks\ncompassion?\" she said.\n\n### Law\n\n### How far can cities go to clear homeless camps? The U.S. Supreme Court will\ndecide\n\nGrants Pass and other cities argue that the 9th Circuit's ruling has fueled\nthe expansion of homeless encampments. But whichever way the case is decided,\nit's not likely to dramatically bring down the enormous number of people\nliving outside in tents and vehicles. Many places simply don't have enough\nshelter beds for everyone. And more importantly, they don't have nearly enough\npermanent, affordable housing. The city of Grants Pass is short by 4,000\nhousing units; nationally, the deficit is in the millions.\n\nThat shortage has pushed rents to levels many cannot afford, which advocates\nsay is a main driver of rising homelessness. Even where places are investing\nheavily to create more affordable housing, it will take a while to catch up.\nThis Supreme Court case won't solve any of that, but it could dramatically\nshape the lives of those forced to live on streets, parks and back alleys for\nyears to come.\n\n  * grants pass\n  * affordable housing\n  * homelessness\n  * Supreme Court\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 162 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
