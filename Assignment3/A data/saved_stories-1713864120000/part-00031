Most of the mass in the protocluster does not reside in the galaxies that\ncan be seen in the centre of the image, but in the gas known as the\nintracluster medium (ICM). The hot gas in the ICM is shown as an overlaid blue\ncloud.\n\nThe hot gas was detected with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA), of which ESO is a partner. As light from the cosmic microwave\nbackground \u2013\u2013 the relic radiation from the Big Bang \u2013\u2013 travels through the\nICM, it gains energy when it interacts with the electrons in the hot gas. This\nis known as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. By studying this effect, astronomers\ncan infer how much hot gas resides in the ICM, and show that the Spiderweb\nprotocluster is in the process of becoming a massive cluster held together by\nits own gravity.\n\nCredit:\n\nESO/Di Mascolo et al.; HST: H.
