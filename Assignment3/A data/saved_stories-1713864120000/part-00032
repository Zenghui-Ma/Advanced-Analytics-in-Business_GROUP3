Various\napproaches have been explored for SS reuse, with energy production emerging as\na viable solution. This study focuses on harnessing energy from domestic\nwastewater treatment (WWT) sewage sludge through plasma gasification.\nEffective syngas production hinges on precise equipment design which, in turn,\ndepends on the detailed feedstock used for characterization. Key components of\nplasma gasification include the plasma torch, reactor, heat exchanger,\nscrubber, and cyclone, enabling the generation of inert slag for landfill\ndisposal and to ensure clean syngas. Designing these components entails\nconsiderations of sludge composition, calorific power, thermal conductivity,\nash diameter, and fusibility properties, among other parameters. Accordingly,\nthis work entails the development of an experimental setup for the plasma\ngasification of sewage sludge, taking into account a comprehensive sludge\ncharacterization. The experimental findings reveal that domestic WWT sewage\nsludge with 40% humidity exhibits a low thermal conductivity of approximately\n0.392 W/mK and a calorific value of LHV = 20.78 MJ/kg. Also, the relatively\nlow ash content (17%) renders this raw material advantageous for plasma\ngasification processes. The integration of a detailed sludge characterization\ninto the equipment design lays the foundation for efficient syngas production.\nThis study aims to contribute to advancing sustainable waste-to-energy\ntechnologies, namely plasma gasification, by leveraging sewage sludge as a\nvaluable resource for syngas production.\n\nKeywords:\n\ngasification; plasma; reactor; sewage sludges\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nSewage sludge (SS), the final byproduct of wastewater treatment plants\n(WWTPs), which handle domestic or industrial effluents, requires proper\nmanagement or safe disposal [1]. According to the latest Eurostat data, in\n2020, the 27 European Member States produced over 3.1 million tons (dry basis\n(d.b.)) of sewage sludge from WWTPs [2]. Currently, the predominant methods of\nhandling SS from WWTPs in Europe include landfilling, incineration, or\nagricultural reuse as a soil amendment [3].\n\nAnother route for handling sewage sludge is energy recovery. Among the various\navailable methods, plasma gasification has emerged as one of the most\neffective and environmentally friendly approaches for both sludge treatment\nand energy generation [4,5]. Plasma gasification, an advanced thermochemical\nprocess, utilizes high temperatures and gas plasma to convert organic matter\ninto high-quality synthetic gas. This process offers several advantages,\nincluding the efficient destruction of organic pollutants, the reduction of\nwaste volume and mass, and energy recovery [6,7,8]. Due to the high\ntemperatures and rapid product quenching, thermal plasma gasification\nminimizes the formation of toxic compounds during waste treatment [9].\nUtilizing this technology, sewage sludge can be decomposed into two primary\nproducts: combustible synthesis gas and inert glassy slag, providing\nsignificant environmental benefits in terms of atmospheric emissions and slag\ntoxicity control [6].\n\nHowever, as plasma gasification is a relatively new technology, there are\nstill gaps in our understanding of its performance and characteristics.\nAdditionally, sewage sludge gasification also presents challenges [9,10],\nmainly due the heterogeneity of this raw material. Some of these challenges\nare presented by Gao et al. [11], such as the low heating value (LHV) of the\nmaterial, the cold gas efficiency (CGE), the carbon conversion efficiency\n(CCE), the greenhouse gas emissions, the high levels of ash production, the\nhigh energy costs due to the need for moisture reduction prior to\ngasification, and the requirement to recover phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and\npotassium (K) from the ash [11]. Additionally, issues related to the geometry\nand dimensions of the plasma gasification reactor are mentioned [9,10].\n\nAnother significant challenge arises from the production of tar during the\ngasification process. Typically, mechanical methods such as scrubbers or\nwashing towers are employed to remove tar from the gas stream. However, these\nmethods merely transfer the problem to a wastewater stream contaminated with\ntar. Therefore, a more effective approach involves tar conversion rather than\nmere removal. Given that tar yields can range from low to 10 wt% or more, they\ncontain a substantial amount of energy. Plasma methods, despite being the most\nexpensive in terms of investment and operational costs, offer distinct\nadvantages over other conversion methods like thermal or catalytic techniques.\nPlasma methods can be seen as a hybrid approach, combining high temperatures\ntypically associated with thermal methods and the presence of reactive species\n(e.g., radicals, electrons, ions, and excited molecules), which significantly\nenhance the decomposition process. This results in a high conversion rate of\ntar into valuable products, ultimately leading to an overall improvement in\nfeedstock conversion [4].\n\nAlthough limited, several studies have been conducted on the gasification of\nvarious types of sludge using plasma technology. The majority of these studies\nwere conducted at the laboratory scale, employing arc electric torches\n[10,12], highlighting the need to explore and contribute to the research on\nsewage sludge plasma gasification processes [9,10].\n\nIn this work, an experimental setup for the plasma gasification of sewage\nsludges is presented. This study aims to contribute to advancing sustainable\nwaste-to-energy technologies, namely plasma gasification, by leveraging sewage\nsludge as a resource for syngas production. By integrating a detailed sludge\ncharacterization into equipment design, we lay the foundation for efficient\nsyngas production. A comprehensive understanding of sludge properties and\ntheir impact on equipment design is crucial for optimizing the plasma\ngasification process. Ultimately, our research aims to reduce the knowledge\ngap regarding the performance and characteristics of plasma gasification,\nparticularly in the context of sewage sludge treatment.\n\n## 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\nThis section describes the experimental setup used in the gasification of\nsewage sludge, the methodologies implemented to characterize the raw material\nand its ashes, and their utility in the design of the gasification reactor and\nits peripherals.\n\n#### 2.1. Experimental Setup\n\nThe experimental setup is based on four main parts, which are arranged\naccording to the scheme illustrated in Figure 1, and include the gasification\nreactor, a heat exchanger, a gas scrubber, and a particle separator, connected\nin series. The gasification reactions occur in the reactor chamber. The raw\nmaterial, the SS sample, will be inserted at half the distance from the\nreactor bottom and placed at the bottom wall of the reactor. The samples will\nbe heated by a plasma torch which is located on the left-hand side wall at an\nangle of 30\u00b0. The plasma torch employed in this experimental setup is a\ncommercially available transferred arc plasma torch, which is housed in a\nwater jacket for cooling purposes. The power supply for the plasma torch is a\nRED STAR, model CUT 65.3, with an input power of 7.8 kW. For calculation\npurposes, a heating efficiency of 50% was applied, as mentioned in the work of\nAli et al. [4]. The original plasma torch is designed to operate with\ncompressed air (4.4\u20135.0 bar) as the process gas, with a flow rate ranging from\n142 to 235 L/min. Both the air flow and the power of the plasma torch can be\nadjusted. The produced gas will be released at the top of the reactor and\nforwarded to a heat exchanger. This equipment will allow for the gas\ntemperature to be reduced to avoid the formation of dioxins and furans. Then,\nthe cold gas will follow to a venturi scrubber, which will allow fine\nparticulates to be captured. The produced gas will finally enter a cyclone\nparticle separator to remove water droplets and the remaining particles that\ntravel with the gas.\n\nFigure 1. Experimental setup scheme.\n\nTo ensure an efficient gasification process and the production of high-quality\nsyngas for energy generation, all equipment must be accurately designed.\nTherefore, the following sections present the design of each piece of\nequipment.\n\n#### 2.2. Sewage Sludge Characterization\n\n#### 2.2.1. Physicochemical Characterization\n\nIn this study, a sample of sewage sludge obtained from a strictly domestic\nwastewater treatment plant, located in the north of Portugal, was selected\nbased on its gasification potential, as concluded by Pacheco et al. [12]. The\nsewage sludge sample was characterized in terms of the loss of humidity at 105\n\u00b0C, volatile solids at 550 \u00b0C, and ashes at 800 \u00b0C, as well as the nitrogen\n(N), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), Sulphur (S), and low and high calorific value\n(LHV, HHV) it contained. Infrared absorption was used to determine the C, H,\nand S content, and the thermal conductivity method was used to determine N\ncontent. To determine the calorific values, an isoperibol bomb calorimeter was\nused.\n\n#### 2.2.2. Thermogravimetric Analysis\n\nA Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry\nAnalysis (DSC) were carried out to characterize the mass loss/gain in terms of\nfunction of temperature. This technique allows for the characterization of the\nthermal decomposition of the substances that comprise the sewage sludge. The\nexperiments were performed using an SDT 2960 Simultaneous DSC-TGA equipment\nfrom TA Instruments (New Castle, DE, USA). To understand the influence of the\natmosphere on the process, all samples were tested under an air atmosphere.\nThe samples were heated to 1100 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min.\n\n#### 2.2.3. Thermal Properties\n\nThe thermal conductivity of the sewage sludge was measured using a hot disk\nTPS technique, depicted in Figure 2. The equipment uses a thin foil disk with\na bifilar spiral pattern made of nickel involving Kapton mica sheets, which\nact as both the temperature sensor and the electrical resistive heater [13].\nTo conduct the experiments, the sensor is sandwiched between two identical\npieces of the same sample that is to be tested. The sample geometry is defined\nbased on the reference geometry presented in the system manual, as\nschematically presented in Figure 1. During the experiments, stepwise heating\nis produced by applying a stepwise current to the sensor, inducing a dynamic\ntemperature field over the sensor and samples, which is monitored over time.\nBy recording the variation in the sensor resistance, it is also possible to\nobtain the increase in temperature as a function of time, which is related to\nthe thermal properties of the sample [14], according to Equation (1):\n\nwhere is the time-dependent temperature increase of the hot disk sensor; r is\nthe radius of the sensor; k is the thermal conductivity of the sample; is a\ndimensionless time function that accounts for the conduction pattern of the\nhot disk sensor, as defined by [15]. An important consideration regarding this\ntechnique is that the sensor is assumed to be placed in an infinite medium, so\nthe propagation of the generated heat does not reach the boundaries of the\nsample throughout the experiment. This is an important factor to take into\nconsideration during the definition of the sample dimensions. In this\ntechnique, the increase in the temperature of the sensor during the transient\nperiod should be linearly proportional to . Thus, can be fit as a fuction of ,\nthe characteristic time \u03b8 can be used as a fitting parameter, and the best\nvalue is used to calculate the thermal diffusivity according to Equation (2).\nThe slope of the line corresponds to the factor , which is applied to obtain\nk.\n\nFigure 2. Experimental setup for thermal conductivity measurements of the\nsewage sludge.\n\n#### 2.3. Sewage Sludge Ashes Characterization\n\n#### 2.3.1. Chemical Composition\n\nX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) is widely used to analyze the chemical\ncomposition of sewage sludge ash. This non-destructive and sensitive technique\nallows for the identification and quantification of elements, including heavy\nmetals and trace elements, providing crucial information for assessing\nenvironmental impacts, identifying toxic substances, and developing effective\nmanagement and treatment strategies for these residues. In this work, the ash\nsample was analyzed using HITACHI equipment (Tokyo, Japan), model EA1000VX.\n\n#### 2.3.2. Particles Diameter\n\nMeasuring the ash\u2019s diameter is important to define the operating conditions\nand sizing of the scrubber and cyclone, since these equipment are used to\nremove the particles from the produced gas. To measure the particle\u2019s\ndiameter, a Laser Diffraction Technique (LDT) is applied using a Malvern 2600.\nLDT, as depicted in Figure 3, uses a low-power He-Ne laser that forms a\ncollimated beam of light. When the beam strikes a particle, light is scattered\nand collected by a receiver lens, which operates as a Fourier transform lens,\nforming the far-field diffraction pattern of the scattered light at its focal\nplane. The scattered light is gathered over a range of solid scattering angles\nby a detector that consists of 31 concentric annular sectors. The unscattered\nlight goes into a small aperture and is monitored to define the volume and\nconcentration of the sample. As the particle size decreases, the diffraction\nangle increases, and the quantification of the intensity of the diffracted\nbeam at any angle allows for the number of particles to be determined [16].\nThe measured size range depends on the focal length of the lens, which can be\nextended from 0.5 \u03bcm up to 2 mm diameters with a dynamic range (d_max/d_min)\nof approximately 100. A size range varying between 100 and 10,000 particles is\nrecommended to ensure accurate measurements.\n\nFigure 3. Experimental setup for sewage sludge ash diameter measurements.\n\nThe measurements are conducted in two steps to discard the influence of the\nexternal light sources. In this context, the background light was measured\nprior to the introduction of the particles, and its contribution was\nsubtracted from the sample measurement. The ashes particles are mixed with\nwater and pass through a solid particle support equipped with quartz windows\nthat allow for optical access to the sample.\n\nTo conduct a data analysis, Malvern 2600 uses the Model Independent Analysis\nthat estimates the volume distribution based on the measured light energy,\nassuming a 15-degree polynomial, from which the new light energy distribution\nis calculated using Equation (3) while the residual difference is obtained\nfrom Equation (4):\n\nwhere is the measured data; is the relative volume of material contained in\nthe particles in size bands i and the data were calculated from the estimated\nvolume distribution. A new set of values of is determined using the difference\nbetween and . This is an iterative process that ends as soon as the residual\nreaches a minimum value.\n\nThe measurement data correspond to the volume distribution of the material in\nthe 32 bands, which is converted into a diameter. The derived diameter that is\nusually used in this context is the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD), D_3,2, given\nby Equation (5) [17].\n\nwhere is the mean diameter of size band i; m and n are subscripts that take\nthe value 3 if a representation of the diameter in terms of volume is desired\nand a value of 2 for the surface.\n\n#### 2.3.3. Fusibility Evaluation\n\nThe fusibility of sewage sludge ash is an important property to consider in\nthe management of these residues, as it affects both the efficiency of the\ntreatment processes and the operation of associated equipment and systems [8],\nnamely the fusibility of ash, which determines its ability to melt and flow.\nIf the slag is excessively fusible, it can adhere to the internal surfaces of\nthe gasifier, causing obstructions and reducing the process efficiency [18].\nTo characterize the ash melting behavior, several parameters were assessed,\nnamely the shrinking starting temperature, deformation temperature, sphere\ntemperature, hemisphere temperature, and flow temperature. These parameters\nwere assessed in an external accredited laboratory. The applied methodology\nwas in accordance with DIN 51730:2022-02 [19].\n\n#### 2.4. System Design\n\n#### 2.4.1. Reactor\n\nThe reactor is the most important part of the system since it is responsible\nfor the efficiency of plasma gasification. The reactor\u2019s chamber is made from\nrefractory cement and has a 340 mm diameter (D) and 1020 mm height, applying\nthe height-to-diameter ratio of 3:1, according to [20], leading to an internal\nvolume of 93 L.\n\nAdditionally, the specific flow rate of the treated sewage sludge was\ncarefully considered during the design optimization process to ensure the\noptimal performance and efficiency of the plasma gasification system. This\nrate was determined based on a typical load for an updraft gasifier of 150\nkg/m^2/h, as reported by Prabir Basu [20], resulting in 15 kg/h in this\nspecific case.\n\nOne of the most relevant properties related to plasma gasification is the\nposition angle of the plasma torch. To ensure effective plasma gasification,\nit is important to optimize the plasma torch length, and the orientation angle\nplays an important role in this context. Therefore, the influence of the\nplasma torch position angle was analyzed numerically using the ANSYS FLUENT\n2020 R2 software. The methodology that was implemented to conduct this study\nis presented below.\n\n#### Simulation Domain and Meshing\n\nThe simulation domain adopted for flow modelling and reactor design\noptimization is depicted in Figure 4. These domains were meshed using ANSYS\nFLUENT, and refinement was conducted at the flow inlet, which corresponds to\nthe nozzle of the torch with a diameter of 5 mm, as shown in Figure 5. For\nmodel simplification, the outlet diameter was converted into a hydraulic\ndiameter of a square surface at the top of the gasifier. To ensure the quality\nof the meshes, different parameters were evaluated to ensure that mesh quality\nfell within the required values: skewness near zero; aspect ratio and element\nquality close to one.\n\nFigure 4. Reactor numerical domain for different position angles: (a) 30\u00b0; (b)\n50\u00b0; (c) 60\u00b0.\n\nFigure 5. Meshed domain.\n\nThe boundary conditions implemented in this model are hot air injection at the\ncircular nozzle of the torch at a temperature of 2726.85 \u00b0C and constant\nvelocity, leading to a Reynolds number of approximately 1552. The induced jet\nflows inside the reactor and mix with the ambient air, before moving up\nthrough the outlet, defined as the pressure outlet boundary condition. The\nwalls are defined by adiabatic and no-slip boundary conditions.\n\n#### Governing Equations\n\nANSYS FLUENT 2020 R1 was applied to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes\n(RANS) equations set (6\u20139), where Equation (6) is the continuity, Equation (7)\nis the momentum, and Equation (8) is the energy equations. The low is assumed\nto be incompressible, since a Mach number below 0.3 was ensured in all\nsimulations. Once the flow is in the transition regime, the SST k-\u03c9 turbulence\nmodel, developed by Menter [21], is selected. This turbulence model is\nconsidered by several authors as an accurate model to simulate jet flows at\nlow computational costs [22,23,24,25,26,27]. The equations used to solve\nturbulence kinetic energy, k, and the specific dissipation rate, \u03c9, are\npresented in Equation (9) and Equation (10), respectively.\n\nwhere u is the velocity vector, p is the fluid pressure field, and T is the\ntemperature. \u03c1, \u03bc, and are the constant physical properties of the fluid and\nrepresent the density, kinematic viscosity, and thermal diffusivity,\nrespectively. \u0413 is the effective diffusivity, G is the generation, and Y is\nthe dissipation of the corresponding variables; S is the user-defined source\nterms, while D_\u03c9 is the cross-diffusion term [28]. These variables were\ndefined for air at a temperature of 2726.85 \u00b0C, according to [29].\n\nThe spatial discretization of diffusion and convective terms is solved using a\nsecond-order upwind scheme. To compute the face values of pressure from the\ncell values, a second-order interpolation scheme is implemented using a\ncentral differencing scheme. Pressure\u2013velocity coupling is applied to derive\nan additional condition for pressure, and a procedure similar to that outlined\nby Rhie and Chow [30] is used to prevent checkerboarding [31]. The pressure-\nbased solver uses a SIMPLE method to couple the pressure and velocity. The\nsimulation is transient, so the governing equations are discretized in time\nthrough a first-order implicit integration. To perform the transient\ncalculations, a fixed time step of 1 \u00d7 10^\u22125 was applied.\n\n#### Grid Sensitivity Analysis\n\nTo estimate the accuracy of the numerical results, a mesh sensitivity analysis\nwas conducted using three different grid sizes. The number of cells selected\nfor each case is presented in Table 1, varying between coarse, medium, and\nfine grids.\n\nTable 1. Grid size.\n\nA grid sensitivity analysis was conducted for the velocity at the jet axis\ncoming from the plasma torch normalized by the maximum recorded velocity\nvalue. The results depicted in Figure 6 show that the different velocity\nprofile follows the same profile. However, the velocity values are slightly\nunderestimated by the medium and coarse grids. The maximum deviations from the\ndata predicted by the fine mesh are 15% and 35% for the medium and coarse\nmesh, respectively. Looking at the medium grid, it seems that 15% is not very\nsignificant, considering that the simulation time is reduced by half compared\nwith the fine mesh. In this context, this grid was selected to conduct the\nnumerical study.\n\nFigure 6. Grid sensitivity analysis.\n\n#### 2.4.2. Heat Exchanger\n\nConsidering the need for a very quick cooling of the gas coming from the\nreactor, a proper heat exchanger (HE) was developed to avoid the formation of\ndioxins and furans. The main factors commonly cited as facilitating the\ngeneration of these compounds are the low combustion temperatures (below 900\n\u00b0C), a residence time in the furnace of below 1.5 s, and the high CO content\n(>100 ppm in the chimney, referred to 7% O_2), among others [32]. Also,\naccording to [33], dioxins and furans are formed in regions after the\ncombustion zone at lower temperatures, approximately between 180 and 550 \u00b0C.\n\nBased on these assumptions, a shell-and-tube heat exchanger was designed.\nTaking into account the temperature and gas flow at the exit of the reactor\n(1000 \u00b0C, 0.16 m^3/s), the residence time in the heat exchanger should be <1.5\ns, and the desired temperature at the exit of the heat exchanger is 80 \u00b0C. As\na cold fluid, a continuous flux of 15 L/min of water at 15 \u00b0C was considered.\n\nThe material available in the company for HE construction was a limitation.\nHowever, despite its unusual dimensions, the available tube was considered for\nthe design of this component. Specifically, for the gas side, stainless steel\ntubes with an external diameter (d) of 25 mm and 2.5 mm thickness were\nconsidered. This has an influence on the compactness of the component, since\nthis thickness seems to be excessive for the pressure level involved, in\naddition to the increase in thermal resistance.\n\nFor the design of the HE, the formulations of the one-shell pass and one-tube\npass in a counter-flow heat exchanger, as proposed by \u00c7engel [34], were used.\n\n#### 2.4.3. Scrubber\n\nThe scrubber is an important component to remove particle matter and acid\ngases from the gas streams. These pollutants are removed by impact, diffusion,\nand absorption using liquid droplets [35]. After the capture of these\npollutants, the liquid is then collected for disposal. In this specific\napplication, the collection will be performed by a cyclone located downstream\nof the scrubber. To ensure the high efficiency of the collection, a venturi\njet scrubber was selected, since this allows for the capture of small\nparticles (>1.0 \u03bcm) and allows for a wider range of liquid-to-gas ratios [36].\n\nTo design the venturi scrubber, a compromise between low-pressure losses and\nhigh collection efficiency must be ensured. To conduct this analysis, the 1D\nmodel developed by Azzopardi and Govan [37] to predict the total number of\nparticles removed at each axial position of the throat was used. In this\nstudy, the throat diameter was fixed at 40 mm and the volumetric flow rate\nthat was considered is equal to the one coming from the reactor, i.e., 0.01625\nm^3/s. The liquid-to-gas ratio is equal to 3 L/m^3, which lies under the range\nof recommended values for a venturi scrubber [36]. The velocity of the\ndroplets was defined as equal to half of the gas velocity, as stated by Howard\nand Mohan [38], corresponding to 6.5 m/s, while the Sauter mean diameter of\nthe atomized droplets was defined by the Nukisayama\u2013Tamasawa equation\npresented by [38]. From this equation, the diameter of the obtained droplets\nwas approximately 475 \u03bcm. To verify if the droplet velocity and diameter fell\nbetween the reference values used in commercially available atomizers, the\nstudy conducted by Miller et al. [39] was referred to, and the obtained values\nwere validated.\n\n#### 2.4.4. Particle Separator\n\nAfter being produced, the gas leaves the reactor and cools down in the HE.\nAfter that, it is forwarded to the wet scrubber whose function is to capture\nparticles in the liquid droplets, removing them from the gas stream. However,\nto ensure the complete removal of particles that were not captured by the\nscrubber, as well as the droplets that may persist in the gas stream, a\ncyclone separator was introduced.\n\nThe sizing of this device was based on the formulations proposed by [40,41].\nThe proceeding started with the characterization of the particle ashes, namely\ntheir size and their density, as described later. As a result of that\ncharacterization, a minimum particle size of 5 \u03bcm (with a density of 1.143\nkg/m^3) was considered for the calculations. In addition to these parameters,\na gas flow rate of 0.01625 m^3/s at 80 \u00b0C was also taken into account when\nsizing a Lapple cyclonic separator.\n\n## 3\\. Results and Discussion\n\n#### 3.1. Sewage Sludge Characterization\n\n#### 3.1.1. Physicochemical Characterization\n\nThe results of the ultimate and proximate analysis of the sewage sludge are\npresented in Figure 7. In the energy recovery of sewage sludges, the calorific\nvalue, humidity, and ash are parameters of particular importance. Regarding\nthe LHV and HHV, the results obtained from the measurements on a dry basis\n(db) are 20.78 MJ/kg and 22.59 MJ/kg, respectively.\n\nFigure 7. Ultimate and proximate analyses of sewage sludge sample.\n\nFocusing on the data expressed in Figure 7, the percentage of loss of humidity\nat 105 \u00b0C, volatile solids at 550 \u00b0C, ashes at 800 \u00b0C, and N, C, H, and S\ncontents show that the sample has a high percentage of volatile solids, low\nash content, and higher values of C and H. These are important properties for\nthe heating value and the composition of the gas produced in a gasifier [20].\nRegarding the percentage of moisture, the sample presents a value greater than\n70%. This sludge characteristic is relevant for plasma gasification since a\nhigh moisture content enhances the gasification process [11,42]. In terms of\nash percentage, the results show that it is around 17.9%, which is an\nacceptable value when compared to the typical ash content found in the\nliterature on sewage sludges [11,20,43,44]. The low fixed carbon content can\nbe attributed to the predominance of organic materials and their rapid\ndecomposition during wastewater treatment [45].\n\n#### 3.1.2. Thermogravimetric Analysis\n\nThe results of the DSC/TGA are presented in Figure 8. The variation in the\nmass loss as a function of temperature shows a reduction of about 80% of the\ntotal mass within the range of 200\u2013600 \u00b0C when using air as an oxidizing\natmosphere. This high value is mainly related to the higher reaction rate\ninduced by the increased volatile matter content. Regarding the heat flow\nvariation as a function of temperature, the results show two peaks that\ncharacterize the occurrence of different reactions. The first peak is expected\nto be due to the combustion of volatile matter, while the second one\ncharacterizes the combustion of char or fixed carbon. According to [46], the\nuncertainty in this experiment can be considered equal to 3.4%.\n\nFigure 8. DSC/TGA measurements: mass loss and heat flow as a function of\ntemperature.\n\n#### 3.1.3. Thermal Properties\n\nThe thermal properties obtained from the hot disk measurements correspond to\nthe dry sewage sludge, and the results are expressed in the first line of\nTable 2. However, the sewage sludge that will be used for gasification has 40%\nhumidity. With this percentage, it is not necessary to introduce steam inside\nthe reactor to improve the production of hydrogen content. Therefore, the\nfinal thermal properties of the sample are a combination of 60% of the\nproperties of the dry sample and 40% of the properties of water at 20 \u00b0C. The\nresults are expressed in the final line of Table 2. Regarding thermal\nconductivity, the low value is also presented by [47,48].\n\nTable 2. Thermal properties of the sewage sludge.\n\n#### 3.2. Sewage Sludge Ashes\n\n#### 3.2.1. Chemical Composition\n\nThe sewage sludge ashes\u2019 chemical characterization is presented in Table 3.\nThe results show a high concentration of Silica (SiO_2), calcium (Ca),\naluminium (Al), potassium (K), sodium phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and trace\nelements like zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). The high aluminium concentration can\nbe explained by the flotation process in wastewater treatment. The remaining\nelements are related to the typical composition of the sewage sludge.\n\nTable 3. Ashes\u2019 chemical composition.\n\n#### 3.2.2. Particle Diameter\n\nThe results recorded by the Malvern 2600 are expressed in terms of volume\ndistribution. Considering previous knowledge about the mean diameter of smoke\nparticles, the lens selected for the measurement was 63 mm, since the\nmeasuring range lies between 0.5 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm. Sauter Mean Diameter was\napplied to determine the particle size. This method does not contain the\nnumber of particles, but instead indicates around which central point of the\nfrequency (surface area or volume/mass) the distribution varies [49]. From\nthis analysis, it was estimated that D_3,2 = 36.23 \u03bcm, while the minimum\nparticle size that was recorded is equal to 11.6 \u03bcm. This last value is the\nreference needed to design the equipment integrated in the experimental setup.\n\n#### 3.2.3. Fusibility Characterization\n\nThe results of the fusibility characterization study provide valuable insights\ninto the thermal behavior and melting properties of sewage sludge ash, crucial\nfor its application in waste management and utilization processes. The results\nobtained are condensed in Table 4. According to the results of the thermal\nsimulation presented earlier, the temperature achieved in the zone where the\nfeedstock will be deposited remains around 1467 \u00b0C. As the ash\u2019s flow\ntemperature is 1350 \u00b0C, the conditions inside the reactor will be suitable to\nensure the complete fusion of the material.\n\nTable 4. Ash melting behavior.\n\nThe characterization of the sewage sludge and ashes provides relevant\ninformation for the appropriate design and construction of a plasma\ngasification setup. Based on these data, the reactor, scrubber, and cyclone\nwere designed to ensure the production of an optimized syngas that can be used\nfor energy production.\n\n#### 3.3. System Design\n\n#### 3.3.1. Reactor\n\nThe numerical results regarding the influence of the torch angle are presented\nin this section. Starting with the flow dynamics inside the reactor, the\nresults depicted in Figure 9 show that, as the torch inclination increases,\nthe distance of the air jet to the surface also increases; this occurs because\nthe distance between the torch and the central axis of the reactor should be\nkept constant for all cases. In that sense, the results demonstrate that the\nlower left corner of the reactor has a great influence on flow development. As\nthe angle increases, a recirculation region is induced in this location,\ninterfering with the flow of the hot air jet that comes from the torch. This\ninterference leads to instabilities along the wall where the waste will be\ndeposited, and a greater temperature gradient and consequent decrease in\nheating efficiency are expected. Therefore, and since this recirculation is\nnot identified when the torch is tilted at 30\u00b0, it is expected that more\ncontrolled and higher temperature and velocity values will be recorded.\n\nFigure 9. Flow profile inside the reactor: (a) 30\u00b0; (b) 50\u00b0; (c) 60\u00b0.\n\nLooking at the development of the streamlines inside the reactor expressed in\nFigure 10, it can be seen that the development of the vortices inside the\nreactor varies depending on the torch angle. For higher angles, larger\nvortices are generated inside the reactor, allowing for an effective mixture\nbetween the hot air coming from the torch and the ambient air. The results,\nnow referring to the xz plane presented in Figure 11, clearly show the\nasymmetrical geometry of these vortices, which does not occur with such\nintensity in the case of the 30\u00b0 angle. However, these large structures\ninteract with the flow of the plasma jet, leading to a reduction in velocity,\nas will be demonstrated by further results.\n\nFigure 10. Streamlines inside the reactor chamber, according to the xy plane:\n(a) 30\u00b0; (b) 50\u00b0; (c) 60\u00b0.\n\nFigure 11. Streamlines inside the reactor chamber, according to the xz plane\nat the top of the reactor ((top) figures) and at the midplane of the jet flow\ninlet ((bottom) figures): (a) 30\u00b0; (b) 50\u00b0; (c) 60\u00b0.\n\nTo quantitatively compare the results, the velocities normalized by the\nmaximum velocity were evaluated for each case: 30\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 60\u00b0. For this\nanalysis, three graphs were constructed that represent the variation in\nvelocity at different regions: along the jet axis, as shown in Figure 12a,\nnext to the intersection zone between the reactor chamber and the torch\noutlet, as shown in Figure 12b, and next to the target surface at a distance\ncorresponding to y = 5 mm, as shown in Figure 12c. The velocity profile allows\nfor the characterization of the flow inside the reactor, and an analysis was\nconducted of the influence of the angle of inclination of the torch. A similar\nflow dynamic was observed for the three cases: a plume with a structure\ntypical to a free jet flow, with maximum velocities recorded at the jet axis\nand a shear layer induced by the interaction of the jet flow and the\nsurrounding air. The jet flows to the reactor\u2019s main chamber and decreases in\nvelocity. Looking at Figure 12a, the jet potential core ends (U/U_max < 0.95)\nat a distance from the nozzle near y/D = 2.7 for 30\u00b0, y/D = 4.2 for 50\u00b0, and\ny/D = 4.6, for 60\u00b0, which is typical in jet flows [50,51]. The major reason\nfor this difference is mainly related to the increased distance between the\nplasma torch inlet and the bottom of the reactor. However, the results show\nthat the average velocity for an inclination of 30\u00b0 is approximately 22% and\n40% higher than that at 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, respectively. Once the jet enters the\nmain chamber, it is deflected and only a portion of the mainstream flux\nreaches the center of the reactor (where the sample will be placed). A vortex\nis induced at the bottom left-hand side of the reactor, which grows higher\nwith an increase in the inclination angle. This vortex leads to an asymmetry\nof the jet flow, with higher velocities recorded at the left-hand side of the\njet axis. This asymmetry will cause a temperature non-uniformity that will\ninterfere with the heating of the sample; thus, the higher the angle, the\ngreater the thermal non-uniformity inside the reactor chamber. After impinging\nthe reactor bottom wall, a non-uniform wall jet region is induced, as is\nclearly observed in Figure 12c. The velocity peak corresponds to approximately\n18%, 8%, and 4% of the maximum velocity for 30\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 60\u00b0, respectively.\nThis peak is recorded near the stagnation region (x/D = 0), and a non-uniform\nvelocity profile is recorded as the flow goes through the right-hand side of\nthe reactor. From these results, it can be concluded that higher velocities\nare observed close to the target surface when the torch is tilted at 30\u00b0.\nThese data corroborate previous observations that demonstrated that high\nangles of inclination of the torch induce vortices of greater magnitude and\nintensity, which interfere with the jet, leading to its degradation and a\nconsecutive decrease in velocity.\n\nFigure 12. Velocity profiles: (a) at the jet axis; (b) near the intersection\nbetween the reactor and the torch exit; (c) near the tager surface (y = 5 mm).\n\nThis velocity profile is directly related to the temperature profiles inside\nthe reactor. The predicted temperature profiles in the previously presented\nregions are depicted in Figure 13.\n\nFigure 13. Temperature profile temperatures inside the reactor chamber: (a)\n30\u00b0; (b) 50\u00b0; (c) 60\u00b0.\n\nThe results expressed in Figure 13 show that the evolution of the velocity\nprofile has a direct influence on the temperature profile, since the\ntemperature profile follows the same trend as the velocity. The results show\nthat higher and uniform temperatures are obtained when the torch is tilted at\na 30\u00b0 angle, and these temperatures decrease as this angle increases.\n\nLooking closely at the velocity profile along the jet axis, as shown in Figure\n14a, near to the intersection zone, as shown in Figure 14b, and near the\ntarget surface at a distance corresponding to y = 5 mm, as shown in Figure\n14c, it appears that these results corroborate the previous conclusions. Since\nthe 30\u00b0 angle allows for greater temperature uniformity in the vicinity of the\ntarget surface, reaching values around 10% and 20% higher than the case of 50\u00b0\nand 60\u00b0, it is concluded that this angle will ensure greater thermal\nuniformity and heating temperatures in the sample. Therefore, the angle of 30\u00b0\nis assumed to be the configuration that will optimize the gasification\nprocess.\n\nFigure 14. Velocity profiles comparison at various positions: (a) at the jet\naxis; (b) near the intersection between the reactor and the torch exit; (c)\nnear the tager surface (y = 5 mm).\n\n#### 3.3.2. Heat Exchanger\n\nAs a result of the calculations, a 5.2 kW heat dissipation power was obtained\nfor 19 tubes with a diameter (d) equal to 25 mm (one-tube pass) inside a shell\nwith a 139.7 mm external diameter (D) and 750 mm length (L). Despite the\nlength of the tubes, the gas velocity inside each tube was estimated to be\naround 2.72 m/s. This means a short residence time of the gas inside HE, at\naround 0.28 s, ensuring a rapid cooling from 1000 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C. The final\ndesign of the HE is presented in Figure 15.\n\nFigure 15. Heat exchanger design.\n\n#### 3.3.3. Scrubber\n\nBased on the calculations conducted for the scrubber, a collection efficiency\nof 88.5% was obtained, and the application of the Azzopardi and Govan [37] 1D\nmodel shows that, to remove all the particles using the presented parameters,\na throat length of 120 mm must be ensured. The final validation of the\nscrubber design consisted of the calculation of the pressure losses based on\nLeith et al. [39]. The obtained value was about 500 Pa, which is considered\nacceptable for this type of application. The design of the Venturi scrubber\nbased on this study is depicted in Figure 16.\n\nFigure 16. Venturi scrubber configuration.\n\n#### 3.3.4. Particle Separator\n\nThe calculations yielded significant results for the cyclonic separator. The\ncapture efficiency was determined to be 0.96, indicating a high effectiveness\nin capturing particles and droplets from the gas stream. In terms of pressure\ndrop, a value of 0.37 kPa was estimated for the cyclonic separator. This\nindicates a relatively low pressure drop, which is desirable to ensure\nefficient operation and minimal energy consumption within the system. The\ndimensions of the cyclonic separator can be observed in Figure 17, providing a\nvisual representation of its structure and size.\n\nFigure 17. Cyclone configuration.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nIn this work, a comprehensive and detailed study was carried out, focusing on\nthe plasma gasification of sewage sludge, an emerging technology that allows\nfor the conversion of organic waste into syngas in a clean and efficient way.\nFor this, the sewage sludge and its ashes were characterized in terms of their\nthermogravimetric, physicochemical, and thermal properties. The results showed\nthat the sewage sludge has a high calorific value (LHV = 20.78 MJ/kg), a high\ncarbon and hydrogen content (C = 57.2%, H = 8.42%), a low sulfur content (S =\n0.46%), and an ash content of 18%. These properties indicate that sewage\nsludge is a suitable raw material for use in the gasification process.\nAdditionally, the resulting ashes have a low melting temperature (1350 \u00b0C),\nwhich determines their ability to melt and flow out of the gasification\nreactor.\n\nKnowledge of the behavior of the raw material is crucial for the design of an\nexperimental plasma gasification system and the different modules that\nconstitute it, such as the reactor, heat exchanger, scrubber, and cyclone. The\nsystem was designed and optimized considering the impacts and properties of\nsewage sludge, as well as the numerical simulations that were carried out to\ninvestigate the influence of the plasma torch angle on the temperature and\nspeed profile within the reactor. It was discovered that the optimal angle of\nthe plasma torch is 30\u00b0, as this allows for higher and more uniform heating\nover the bottom surface where the sample will be placed, optimizing the\ngasification process. According to the simulations, the maximum temperature\nreached in the reactor was 1467 \u00b0C. For the heat exchanger, a heat dissipation\nof 5.2 kW was determined, with a total of 19 tubes of 25 mm diameter inside a\nshell with an external diameter of 139.7 mm and a length of 750 mm. The\ncollection efficiency of the scrubber was estimated to be 88.5%, with a\npressure of approximately 500 Pa. For the particle separator, we achieved a\ncapture efficiency of 96%, with a pressure drop of 0.37 kPa. This study\nsignificantly contributes to the advancement of knowledge and the technology\nof plasma gasification, providing valuable information for the design and\noperation of the gasification system. This work is an important step for the\napplication of plasma gasification in the management of sewage sludge waste\nand in the production of sustainable energy.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, F.O., L.M., J.C.T. and C.V.; formal analysis, N.P. and\nF.V.B.; investigation, N.P., A.R., F.P. and F.V.B.; methodology, N.P., A.R.,\nF.P. and F.V.B.; project administration, F.O. and C.V.; resources, F.O.,\nJ.C.T. and C.V.; software, N.P. and F.V.B.; supervision, L.M., J.C.T. and\nC.V.; validation, N.P., A.R., F.P. and F.V.B.; writing\u2014original draft, N.P.\nand F.V.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.M., J.C.T. and C.V.
