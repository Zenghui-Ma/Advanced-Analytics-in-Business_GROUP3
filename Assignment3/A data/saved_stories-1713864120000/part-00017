Now, thanks to J. Michael Straczynski, he\u2019s back.\nAnd louder than ever.\n\nby Ryan Britt\n\n12 hours ago\n\nLais Borges/Inverse; CBS; Getty\n\nThe Inverse Interview\n\nIn 1968, a notoriously caustic science fiction writer accused Star Trek\ncreator Gene Roddenberry of peddling \u201cutopian bullshit.\u201d In 1978, this same\nwriter \u2014 in an introduction written for Doctor Who paperbacks \u2014 mocked Star\nWars, decrying it as \u201cadolescent nonsense.\u201d In 1983, when he learned that\nJames Cameron had admitted to \u201cripping off\u201d one of his stories, he sued and\ngot his name put in the end credits of The Terminator. In a 1979 interview in\nStarlog, Mark Hamill, baffled by this angry, impish contrarian, said: \u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to get on a panel with Ellison... I thought he was like a game show\nhost.\u201d So who the hell was Harlan Ellison? And more importantly, why did he\nmatter?\n\nFor generations of science fiction and fantasy aficionados, saying the name\nHarlan Ellison is like uttering a dark spell. Ellison\u2019s writing \u2014 primarily in\nshort story format \u2014 is fantastic and provocative, but his reputation for\ncontentiousness was equally potent, often overshadowing the art itself. And\nfor younger genre fans, the name Harlan Ellison might not mean anything at\nall. If you\u2019re into science fiction and fantasy and came of age in the new\nmillennium (and his 2014 Simpsons cameo went over your head), there\u2019s a good\nchance you\u2019ve never heard of Ellison.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when he was one of the hottest speakers on college campuses\nanywhere, and now, he\u2019s fallen between the cracks,\u201d J. Michael Straczynski\ntells Inverse. \u201cIt was really important for me to introduce people to Harlan\u2019s\nwork again. A lot of his work just hasn\u2019t been available for the past 10 or 20\nyears.\u201d\n\nFollowing Ellison\u2019s death in 2018, Straczynski \u2014 comic book writing legend and\ncreator of Babylon 5 \u2014 set out to reboot the legacy of the most energetic, and\nperhaps misunderstood, figure in all of speculative fiction. But this mission\nisn\u2019t an attempt to sanitize or censor Ellison. Instead, with the release of a\nnew book Greatest Hits (edited by Straczynski, with introductions from Neil\nGaiman and Cassandra Khaw), Ellison\u2019s specific brand of fantasy has re-emerged\nfrom those cracks, zombie warts and all.\n\n## The Leader of the New Wave\n\nHarlan Ellison in 1977.\n\nBarbara Alper/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nHarlan Ellison hated labels. Especially the label of \u201csci-fi writer.\u201d In a\n2013 profile written by Jaime Lowe for New York Magazine, Ellison said, \u201cCall\nme a science-fiction writer and I will come to your house and nail your dog\u2019s\nhead to the coffee table!\u201d\n\nPart of his animosity stemmed from his tireless work to undo the genre\nstereotypes and constraints put on writers who worked outside of the\nmainstream. From the beginning of the 20th century up to the 1960s, the genre\nof science fiction was very different from what came next. A huge part of that\nchange was the revolution of the \u201cNew Wave\u201d of science fiction writers who\npushed back against the stodgier and stuffier traditions of \u201cHard SF\u201d and\ninfused the genre with more literary and poetic sensibilities. Some started\nsaying the written genre of \u201cSF\u201d stood for \u201cspeculative fiction,\u201d not just\nscience fiction. But without Ellison, science fiction (or speculative fiction)\nmight never have grown up.\n\n\u201cWhat Harlan did in particular was to codify the New Wave,\u201d Straczynski says.\n\u201cWith Dangerous Visions, he pulled it all together into one place and made it\nan event.\u201d\n\nPublished in 1967, Dangerous Visions was a massive SF anthology of short\nstories, all edited and acquired by Ellison. (It\u2019s just been republished,\ncomplete with a new introduction from Patton Oswalt.) The goal was to give\nwriters a home for short stories that were so extreme or taboo that even\nscience fiction publications wouldn\u2019t touch them. The first volume included\nedgy tales from Philip K. Dick, Robert Bloch, and J.G. Ballard, while the\nsecond volume, Again, Dangerous Visions, boasted classic short stories from\nthe likes of Ursula K. Le Guin, Kurt Vonnegut, Joanna Russ, and Kate Wilhelm.\nAs something of a trademark of Ellison, each story contained a lengthy\nintroduction about the author, written in a rapid-fire, off-the-cuff style\nthat would make Hunter S. Thompson blush. In his introduction to Dangerous\nVisions, Ellison brazenly declared: \u201cWhat you hold in your hands is more than\na book. If we\u2019re lucky, it will be a revolution.\u201d In a sense, he was right.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the whole thing about social movements,\u201d Straczynski says. \u201cOften,\none person stands up and sort of embodies all of what they\u2019re saying, and then\nit becomes a movement, and then it becomes a thing. And with Dangerous Visions\nand the New Wave, Harlan became that movement and that spearhead.\u201d\n\nBut beyond bolstering the careers of others (he was Octavia Butler\u2019s mentor\nand champion) Ellison\u2019s own writing was unlike any other science fiction\nstories in the field. His two most famous stories, \u201cRepent, Harlequin, Said\nthe Ticktock Man\u201d (1966) and \u201cI Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\u201d (1967), are\nsimultaneously arresting and, for their time, extremely creative. In the\nfirst, a future society obsessed with time subtracts minutes from people\u2019s\nlives when they are late or break the law. In the second, a sadistic AI keeps\nsix human beings alive and tortures them to the ends of the Earth. But that\u2019s\njust the tip of the dark matter iceberg that is Harlan Ellison.\n\n> \u201cHe pulled it all together into one place and made it an event.\u201d\n\nHe pioneered stories about super-powered telepaths with his classic \u201cDeeper\nThan Darkness\u201d (1957) and touched on concepts of immortal, undying evil in\n\u201cMefisto in Onyx\u201d (1993). When read today, his doppelganger story \u201cShatterday\u201d\n(1977) feels like a condensed version of a David Lynch movie, combined with\nthe parallel worlds antics of contemporary Apple TV shows like Constellation\nand Dark Matter.\n\nBut Ellison\u2019s brand of dark speculative fiction wasn\u2019t just limited to the\npage. He was also part of a growing trend in the 1950s and 1960s, in which\nauthors of prose sci-fi began writing for TV. With thrilling episodes of The\nMan From U.N.C.L.E. and The Outer Limits, plus authorship of what is\nconsidered to be the best episode of the original Star Trek, Ellison was like\na one-person Black Mirror. Indeed, one of his sci-fi horror stories, \u201cLife\nHutch,\u201d was adapted as part of Love Death and Robots in 2021.\n\nSo with all of this success and brilliant output, why was Harlan Ellison so\nangry?\n\n## The Antichrist of Science Fiction\n\nWriter Harlan Ellison at Mile High comics book store in 1982.\n\nDenver Post/Getty Images\n\nHarlan Ellison wrote Star Trek\u2019s seminal time-travel tragedy, the 1967 episode\n\u201cThe City on the Edge of Forever.\u201d For almost six decades, this single story\nhas often been cited as the best episode of Star Trek, ever, and its legacy\ncontinues to be relevant to the canon today \u2014 Michelle Yeoh\u2019s upcoming Section\n31 movie is a direct result of her character, Philippa Georgiou, stepping\nthrough the Guardian of Forever, a time portal originally introduced in\nEllison\u2019s episode.\n\nEllison infamously hated the aired version of the episode. While at least one\nentire book has been written about this kerfuffle, Ellison\u2019s frustration\nbasically comes down to a rowdy, and utterly divergent rewrite, which he said\ncompromised his artistic integrity. Ellison felt steamrolled by Gene\nRoddenberry, which was ironic because just one year prior he\u2019d formed \u201cThe\nCommittee\u201d \u2014 a select group of massive science fiction authors, including\nFrank Herbert, A.E. van Vogt, and others \u2014 with the express purpose of making\nsure Star Trek remained on the air.\n\n> \u201cI think he just saw a lot of sloppiness going on [with Star Wars].\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Star Trek really did was popularize science fiction in ways that hadn\u2019t\nbeen done before,\u201d Straczynski says. \u201cIt brought a new language in the\nvernacular to the popular culture. It galvanized the space program. There will\nnever be another Star Trek any more than there\u2019ll be another Beatles, and\ntheir place in the culture cannot be overestimated. The downside of that is\nthat it codified a certain kind of storytelling in ways that limit other\nopportunities.\u201d\n\nEllison clearly saw the rise of big franchises like Star Trek and Star Wars as\na double-edged sword for the larger world of speculative fiction. Yes, it made\nSF more mainstream, but it was also reductive. So he went on the attack. In\nthe humorous and raunchy story \u201cHow\u2019s the Nightlife on Cissalda?\u201d (1977),\nEllison, still annoyed by his Star Trek experience, depicted a fictionalized\nversion of William Shatner unsuccessfully trying to seduce an alien creature.\n\nThe classic Star Trek episode \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever.\u201d\n\nCBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty Images\n\nWhen it came to Trek, Harlan Ellison liked to bite the hand that fed him.\n\n\u201cHe could dine off of \u2018I wrote for Star Trek\u2019 for quite some time,\u201d\nStraczynski says. \u201cHe was able to parlay that to success in many respects,\neven though he hated the process.\u201d\n\nWhile his anger over being rewritten explains some of his animosity with Star\nTrek \u2014 and its fans \u2014 why was Ellison so anti Star Wars? As someone from the\nprint world of science fiction who had tried to start a more progressive,\nliterary trend in the genre, Ellison almost certainly saw the gee-whiz\nswashbuckling brand of Star Wars\u2019 heroism as inherently regressive, more\nreminiscent of the conservative era of SF publishing in the \u201930s and \u201940s,\nthan anything from what was then the modern era of speculative fiction.\n\n\u201cI think he just saw a lot of sloppiness going on [with Star Wars],\u201d\nStraczynski says. \u201cHarlan was fairly rigorous in his writing, and there was\njust so much there that didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nEllison was hardly a voice in the wilderness on this topic: His friend and\ncolleague Ursula K. Le Guin also trashed Star Wars in 1978, writing, \u201cWhat is\nnostalgia doing in a science fiction movie?\u201d\n\nBecause of his acerbic and often petty put-downs, Ellison behaved in public\nmore like a bratty rock star than a writer. In a 1977 issue of Fantasy and\nScience Fiction, he even referred to himself as \u201cthe antichrist of science\nfiction.\u201d In 1982, in the introduction for Ellison\u2019s book Stalking the\nNightmare, Stephen King acknowledged that not everyone was down with Ellison\u2019s\nbrand of iconoclasm but defended his artistic idealism, writing, \u201cPeople who\nare afraid don\u2019t like people who are brave.\u201d\n\n## A Rebirth Before Death\n\nHarlan Ellison and lifelong friend Walter Koenig (of Star Trek fame) at the\nStar Trek Las Vegas Convention in 2014. Ellison rarely did Star Trek\nconventions but lightened up on his animosity toward Trekkies in the last\nyears of his life.\n\nGabe Ginsberg/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nBecause he cared about human rights (and the often tramped-on rights of\nwriters), Ellison didn\u2019t make things easy on himself. As Straczynski writes in\nhis introduction to Greatest Hits, it was \u201cexhausting\u201d to be Harlan Ellison.\n\nBut then, after 2006, following a surreal acceptance speech at the Hugo\nAwards, something unexpected happened: Harlan Ellison, publicly, appeared to\nrepent for some of his bad behavior. He was no longer giving terse and angry\ninterviews. He was apologizing. He allowed a documentarian to chronicle his\nlife. He even lightened up on Trekkies. In 2014, with the full cooperation of\nthe Star Trek licensing division, IDW Comics published Star Trek: Harlan\nEllison\u2019s City on the Edge of Forever, a five-part miniseries that presented\nEllison\u2019s original award-winning teleplay as an episode of the classic Trek.\nIn the letters pages, Ellison even walked back long-held assertions about how\nhis script was misinterpreted, admitting, among other things, that despite\ndecades of complaining about other writers not knowing the difference between\n\u201crunes\u201d and \u201cruins,\u201d it turns out no such confusion ever existed.\n\nIn 2011, I was asked to call Harlan Ellison, after having written a review of\nhis short story, \u201cHow Interesting: A Tiny May.\u201d Fearful of his litigious\nreputation (I had compared Ellison to the Gallagher brothers from Oasis in my\nessay), I dialed the number with trepidation. But it turned out that the angry\nold man had merely wanted to thank me, saying \u201cI appreciate you taking the\ntime to read my story and say something about it.\u201d\n\nSo, what happened? Why did Ellison mellow out later in his life? While it\u2019s a\nmuch longer tale \u2014 that Straczynski plans to tell in due course \u2014 let\u2019s just\nsay that the lighter, more ebullient side of Ellison was partially because of\nthe influence of Straczynski himself. There\u2019s a reason why Ellison chose\nStraczynski to take on his literary estate, and their friendship and trust for\neach other is part of why Ellison\u2019s final years were ones of good humor and\ngrace.\n\n## A Writer\u2019s Writer\n\nHarlan Ellison, around the time he edited Dangerous Visions in 1967.\n\nEverett/Shutterstock\n\nEllison disliked the pretension of writers and often insisted it shouldn\u2019t be\nthought of as a \u201choly chore\u201d but a job like any other. He often would sit in\nthe windows of bookshops with his typewriter and write short stories based on\nprompts that were put in sealed envelopes ahead of time. In the final short\nstory in Greatest Hits \u2014 \u201cAll the Lies That Are My Life\u201d \u2014 Ellison makes a\nworking-class distinction between an author and a writer. The former was\nsomeone who liked awards and prestige, the latter was \u201csomeone who gets\nhemorrhoids from sitting on his ass all his life... writing.\u201d\n\nThis kind of attitude is probably best exemplified in his epic \u201cPay the\nWriter\u201d rant, which highlights the ways in which the act of writing is so\nbrutally devalued in the capitalist nightmare. Celebrated writer Patty Lin \u2014\nthe author of the recently published memoir End Credits: How I Broke Up With\nHollywood \u2014 remembers Harlan Ellison\u2019s staunch support of the rights of\nwriters fondly. At the end of the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike, Lin\nrecalls Ellison being furious that the WGA had capitulated too easily. Wearing\n\u201crumpled pajamas,\u201d Lin says, Ellison chastised the union leadership for not\ngoing far enough. \u201cWe had them by the balls,\u201d Lin remembers Ellison saying,\ndepressed that the WGA didn\u2019t get a better contact.\n\n> \u201cIt was that no-bullshit, justifiably angry way he expressed it that was so\n> on brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved Harlan Ellison for what he said that day,\u201d Lin tells Inverse. \u201cIt was\nexactly what I was thinking and what many other people in that room were\nprobably thinking. It was that no-bullshit, justifiably angry way he expressed\nit that was so on brand. And that dramatic flair was what made him a great\nstoryteller.\u201d\n\nAs the title suggests, Greatest Hits is a kind of historical document. These\nare stories that don\u2019t necessarily reflect where science fiction and fantasy\nare going but where the genre has been, as seen through the dark lenses of\nHarlan Ellison. Some of the stories (like \u201cShatterday\u201d) hold up beautifully.\nSome, as Cassandra Khaw points out in her introduction, have problematic\nelements.\n\nBut unlike recent reissues of books by Roald Dahl or Ian Fleming, these\nstories remain uncensored. The fight against censorship was one of Ellison\u2019s\nlifelong passions, and so, other than a few content warning labels in the\nbook, the sex, sci-fi, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll of this writer's vision remains\nintact and raucous. Like the punk rock of genre fiction, Ellison\u2019s stories are\nas jarring and blistering as ever.\n\n\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t touch Harlan\u2019s stuff, man,\u201d Straczynski says. \u201cEven if he\u2019s\ndead, he\u2019ll come after you.\u201d\n\nHarlan Ellison\u2019s Greatest Hits is out now from Union Square and Co.\n\nGreatest Hits (Harlan Ellison) Edited by J.
