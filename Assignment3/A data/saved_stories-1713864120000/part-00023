The government is drafting a new mandatory code that will make sure social media platforms better protect customers against scams.\n\nAs a martial artist, Catherine Wilson gets up each day ready for a fight \u2013 but\nit is big tech that is proving to be her most difficult opponent.\n\nHer Melbourne gyms teach choke holds and leg locks; for the fighters, it's\nabout having the confidence to take down a bigger stronger opponent.\n\nOnline, Ms Wilson has been trapped in a long-running battle to reclaim her\nbusiness's Facebook account.\n\nFor nine months she's been begging Meta for access to be restored after her\naccount was hacked.\n\nNo stranger to a fight, Ms Wilson didn't know how difficult it would be to\nregain her Facebook accounts.(ABC News: Patrick Stone)\n\n\"It is a total sh*tshow,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm a mum of two kids, my partner is doing it as well and we were just forced\ninto doing it all hours of the day trying to get this resolved, it's been a\nhuge burden.\"\n\nShe's one of a growing number of Facebook and Instagram users, social media\nplatforms owned by Meta, targeted by criminals.\n\nFirst, the hackers compromise an account, change the password and then take it\nover locking out the rightful owner.\n\nSometimes the hackers spend heavily on advertising using the victim's credit\ncard details \u2014 often on scam ads.\n\nThe ABC has reported widely on scams flourishing on Meta's platforms.\n\nThe Albanese government has singled out the tech giant for criticism claiming\nscams are running \"rife\".\n\n### Facebook scam victim on mission to stop others being burned\n\nAustralians are losing their life savings to a massive fraud syndicate. This\n'furious' victim wants to stop others being burned.\n\nRead more\n\nIn the United States, there's been a dramatic and alarming spike in Meta\nhacking cases, with one state seeing an increase of more than 700 per cent in\na year.\n\nHere in Australia, there's a substantial rise too \u2014 with an increase of more\nthan 120 per cent in small business cases against digital platforms since July\n2022.\n\nMany of the hacked account holders complain Meta is difficult to deal with,\noffers mainly generic responses, and getting hold of a real person feels\nalmost impossible.\n\nIt's leading to calls for new powers to force digital platforms to act and\nlarge fines if they don't.\n\n## Customer support 'black hole'\n\nMs Wilson runs marketing for three Melbourne gyms under the banner Dominance\nMMA.\n\nShe found paying for advertising on Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram,\nwas essential for attracting new members.\n\nLast July she was suddenly locked out of her pages.\n\n\"It made me feel sick when I realised that we were hacked.\n\n\"The process of what played out afterwards, I felt trapped and very small.\"\n\nTo make matters worse the hackers started spending her company's money, lots\nof it.\n\nMs Wilson said they set up a $20,000 per day ad campaign for a page called\n\"Hot Trend Today\".\n\nMs Wilson has gyms across Melbourne but lost a key marketing platform when she\nwas hacked.(ABC News: Patrick Stone)\n\nShe was eventually able to get money back from the bank but the financial\nimpact of being locked out continued.\n\nThe real challenge began after she contacted Meta for help.\n\nDespite nine months of message chats, emails and the occasional phone call,\nshe remains locked out, unable to purchase an advertising campaign.\n\nDo you know more about Meta hackers targeting Australian businesses?\n\nEmail Specialist.Team@abc.net.au\n\nShe has now regained access to be able to post on the pages.\n\n\"We've definitely fallen into a black hole.\"\n\nHer business has suffered and she estimates it has cost tens of thousands of\ndollars.\n\nIn one early chat Meta told her not to expect a quick fix.\n\n> \"Issues like these can potentially take months to be fully resolved.\n>\n> \"We get a lot of requests related to hacked accounts,\" the message said.\n\nAnother Meta email suggested staff were overwhelmed.\n\n> \"Our technical team is currently experiencing huge volumes.\"\n\nOther responses repeated reassuring lines about \"looking into your concern\nclosely\".\n\n\"It was incredibly patronising because our livelihood and our business was\nbeing impacted, and they were telling us to have a nice day,\" Ms Wilson said.\n\nIn one reply she said:\n\n> \"Received this same email three times with no progress...Just let me know\n> when things are actually being done.\"\n\nDespite Ms Wilson putting extra security measures in place, including two-\nfactor authentication, five months later hackers struck again.\n\nThis time Ms Wilson's personal Facebook account was hijacked to get access to\nthe business pages again.\n\nMeta permanently deleted Ms Wilson's personal account, which removed all of\nher personal and business-related posts.\n\n\"There's no other business that would be able to provide a service to\nAustralian small businesses and behave in this way,\" she said.\n\n## Meta in a 'league of its own'\n\nAnger and frustration with Meta is high across the United States too.\n\nIn March, representatives from 40 states wrote to the company about the huge\nrise in cases involving people having accounts taken over by hackers and then\nbeing locked out.\n\nThe letter stated:\n\n> \"The frequency and persistence of account takeovers on Meta-owned platforms\n> puts it in a league of its own.\"\n\nIn New York, complaints increased tenfold over four years and Vermont's jumped\nby 740 per cent in just one year.\n\nMs Klem is the director of consumer outreach and education for the Office of\nthe Attorney-General in Oregon, USA.(Supplied)\n\nEllen Klem works for Oregon's Attorney General, one of the letter's key\nsignatories.\n\nShe told the ABC the volume of Meta complaints was \"shocking\" but likely to be\nfar worse.\n\n\"An increase that's over 700 per cent (in Vermont) ... that's wild ... my jaw\nfell to the floor.\n\n\"North Carolina had a 330 per cent increase, Illinois 256 per cent,\nPennsylvania 270 per cent.\n\n\"What is most alarming I think about these statistics is that these are just\nthe people that complained ... what we're seeing here is really just the tip\nof the iceberg,\" Ms Klem, the Director of Consumer Outreach told the ABC.\n\nThe US states have accused Meta of failing to adequately resource prevention\nand customer support, pushing the financial burden onto the taxpayer.\n\nThe letter questioned whether massive staff cuts were behind customers\nstruggling to find meaningful help.\n\n\"The help that they are receiving, if any, is moving way too slowly and we\nwant more from them,\" Ms Klem said.\n\nMs Klem said Meta recently responded acknowledging the concerns.\n\nIn many cases, users give up and create new accounts, like Brisbane artist\nGiles Kilham.\n\n\"Dealing with Meta was frustrating,\" Mr Kilham said.\n\n\"It just goes into some abyss and you never hear anything again.\"\n\nHe relies on Instagram to sell his work which brings new life to tired vintage\npaintings by introducing his psychedelic skulls, creeping tentacles and plenty\nof other weird and wonderful creatures.\n\nTwo years ago his account was hijacked after someone he knew also had their\naccount compromised.\n\nThe hackers sent him a phishing message pretending to be the other person and\nhe responded.\n\nBrisbane artist Giles Kilham was forced to give up his Instagram account when\nhe was hacked.(ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\n\"It all happened via direct messages on Instagram.\n\n\"They asked for assistance (and) I unwittingly gave the hackers the ability to\nget into my account and change my password and throw me out.\"\n\nHackers took over and started posting links to Bitcoin scams and direct\nmessaged his 4,500 followers trying to take over their accounts too.\n\nHe contacted Meta but despite following all their instructions he was\nunsuccessful and didn't regain access and the account appears to have been\ndeleted.\n\nMr Kilham had to start from scratch which meant waving goodbye to his original\nhandle and his customer base.\n\n\"I definitely lost all the engagement (on Instagram) that just dropped off a\ncliff.\n\nMr Kilham lost engagement and followers when hackers used a phishing scam to\ntarget his account.(ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\n\"I was getting regular contact about doing commission work and potential\nillustration jobs and that all sort of just completely disappeared,\" Mr Kilham\nsaid.\n\n## Slow fix to the 'fastest growing' problem\n\nThe true scale of the problem in Australia isn't known because there's no\nplace for every social media user to complain.\n\nDespite that, some are coming forward to Bruce Billson's office, as the Small\nBusiness Ombudsman, in massive numbers.\n\nAustralian Small Business Ombudsman, Bruce Billson, says the real number of\nbusinesses affected by Meta hacks is unknown.(Supplied: Australian Small\nBusiness and Family Enterprise Ombudsman)\n\nThere have been 140 cases in six months about digital platforms like Meta's.\n\n\"It's the fastest growing area of business-to-business disputes that my agency\nis handling,\"\n\n\"We are a taxpayer-funded resource and this really should be sorted out at the\nplatform long before we need to get involved,\" Mr Billson said.\n\nEven with a direct line to Meta, fixing the problem can be slow.\n\n\"By the time they get to us, those businesses are exasperated, they are\nfinancially harmed and they're at their wit's end, and we sometimes can get an\noutcome for them in a number of days,\" he said.\n\n\"Even where we're involved, it can take weeks and sometimes months.\"\n\nThe ombudsman is now watching to see if mass layoffs at Meta make the\nsituation worse.\n\n\"We're very interested to see how staffing reductions at these platforms\nimpacts on their dispute resolution capability,\" Mr Billson said.\n\n\"We'd be concerned if an already ordinary level of performance deteriorates\nfurther.\"\n\nThe Consumer watchdog, the ACCC has criticised tech companies handling of\ndisputes and wants the government to introduce an ombudsman which could force\nthem to act.\n\nThe government is also drafting a new mandatory code that will impose new\nobligations on social media platforms to better protect customers against\nscams.\n\nSome consumer advocates are calling for that to include financial penalties.\n\nMeta was unavailable for an interview and did not respond to written\nquestions. A company spokesman said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything further to add to\nyour story.\u201d\n\nIt's little solace for small businesses like Ms Wilson's, who is calling for\nchange.\n\n\"The power imbalance is obvious,\" she said.\n\n\"We're begging for assistance to get back onto this platform that we now\nhate.\"\n\n### Contact the ABC's Specialist Reporting Team:\n\nPosted 6h ago6 hours agoMon 22 Apr 2024 at 6:49pm\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### After Jo lost $500k through an Australian company, she thought it would be easy to track down.
