But not all the publicity\nhas been positive.\n\nThe 1,907-foot tall Legends Tower, proposed by developer Scot Matteson, would\nbe part of the Boardwalk at Bricktown project planned for what is now a\nsurface parking lot at Reno and Oklahoma Avenues in Lower Bricktown.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Planning Commission this month recommended the city council\napprove zoning for a proposed 1,907-foot-high tower but warned they do not\nlike renderings showing extensive use of LED signage throughout the four-tower\ndevelopment.\n\nAt the commission meeting, Oklahoma City resident Cynthia Ciancarelli\nquestioned whether building the tallest tower in the United States might make\nit prone to natural disasters or a target for terrorists.\n\n\u201cOklahoma City is a playground for investors,\u201d Ciancarelli said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t\nwant to invest in one of the of strongest economies in the U.S? But why do\nthey want to build the tallest building in the United States? We have severe\nstorms, earthquakes \u2015 Oklahoma is one-stop shopping (for disasters).\u201d\n\nWould natural disasters really have a strong impact on the building? Here's\nwhat we know about plans to construct the tallest building in America:\n\n## How tall would the proposed building be?\n\nThe California developer announced plans last month to increase the height of\nthe Legends Tower to 1,907 feet tall \u2014 a symbolic figure in that Oklahoma\nbecame a state in 1907.\n\nThis would make the Legends Tower the tallest building in the U.S. and the\nfifth tallest in the world, the developers say. The tallest is the Burj\nKhalifa in Dubai, which is 2,716 feet tall.\n\n## Will the skyscraper be safe from tornadoes, earthquakes?\n\nModern skyscrapers are built to withstand high winds and earthquakes using\ntechnology that allows them to sway several feet in each direction without\ncompromising its steel structure.\n\nHowever, if a high-rise building were to be in the midst of a tornado, it\nwould likely sustain severe window damage.\n\nWhen a F3 tornado hit the Bank One Tower in Fort Worth in 2000, 80% of the\n35-story tower's windows were destroyed. The building was almost demolished,\nbut was instead converted into a residential tower.\n\n## When will the OKC skyscraper be built?\n\nThe project covers more than 3 acres and is planned to host more than 2\nmillion square feet of residential, retail and entertainment development,\nincluding two Hyatt hotels, condos, apartments, stores and restaurants.\n\nThe development will also have a lagoon and boardwalk. Also coming to the\narea, a new arena for the NBA franchise Oklahoma Thunder, which is expected to\ncost at least $900 million.\n\nWork on the first three 345-foot towers is scheduled to begin this year; the\nLegends Tower would be built after those are completed.\n\n## Why was Oklahoma chosen for the country's tallest building?\n\nPointing to a period of growth, Matteson said in a statement that Oklahoma\nCity is \"well-positioned to support large-scale projects like the one\nenvisioned for Bricktown.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that this development will be an iconic destination for the city,\nfurther driving the expansion and diversification of the growing economy,\ndrawing in investment, new businesses, and jobs,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a dynamic\nenvironment and we hope to see The Boardwalk at Bricktown stand as the pride\nof Oklahoma City.\u201d\n\n## Is it even possible to build the tallest skyscraper in the US in OKC?\n\nNorb Delatte, an engineering professor at Oklahoma State University, along\nwith Jerome Hajjar, a professor at Northeastern College of Engineering in\nBoston, both said despite concerns about Oklahoma's location within Tornado\nAlley, among others, the tower is doable from a structural standpoint.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly an unusual and distinctive structure for a city the size of\nOklahoma City,\u201d Hajjar said. \u201cA building system like this, along with the\nsurrounding buildings, can be an anchor for transforming the city.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Subscription Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Site Map\n  * Accessibility\n  * Our Ethical Principles\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024\n\n## About Your Privacy\n\nClicking on the \"Reject All\" Button retains the default setting of only\nstrictly necessary cookies.\n\nWe and our 71 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
