They are in many countries around\nthe world. You can see them in our list below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\nIf that is not enough we had 153 jobs posted at the end of last week.\n\n###\n\nYou must be excited to come to work \ud83c\udf08\n\nLangchain makes apps that assist LLM developers. I had a bit of a chuckle over\nthe weekend when I saw that they have a Product Manager role in San Francisco,\nwith the following requirement...\n\n> Candidate must be excited to work 5 days in-office in San Francisco.\n\nRemember to also smile with your eyes.\n\n###\n\nOpenAI hires more fighting Irish \u2618\ufe0f\n\nOver the Easter weekend we spotted how OpenAI was looking to counteract the\npassing of the European Union\u2019s AI Act by hiring staff.\n\nThis trend is continuing with the company looking to hire more members of\ntheir legal team to combat this challenge from their Dublin office. Interested\n?\n\n> OpenAI - EU Privacy Counsel - Dublin \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\n\n##\n\nSome anomalies... that include Anomalo \ud83d\udcc8\n\nYou may see regular job postings from Anduril, Databricks, OpenAI etc in these\nposts. They are well funded and now large companies. What is interesting is\nwhen I see hiring spikes at other smaller, emerging companies.\n\nCompanies hiring more jobs than usual today include:\n\n  * Anaconda (4) - Package and environment management system \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\n  * Anomalo (3) - Data Quality Monitoring Platform \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\n  * Pixlr (4) - Free online photo editor \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec\n\nThe above could indicate growth through a boost in revenue or funding. Maybe\nboth.\n\nShare\n\n### AI Startup Jobs\n\nArtificial Intelligence startup jobs twice-weekly mailer.
