Like cleaning earwax from an ear, and then letting a\ncat nom it, and then, oft as not, knock it off the table or desk\u2014as indeed\ncats are notorious for doing with any small object in reach. But while\nwatching my cat play with Q-tips (used or not), I\u2019ve noticed that no matter\nhow many times I put down a Q-tip on my desk after he\u2019d knocked it off, he was\nstill interested in knocking it off & then watching it intently\u2014as if he had\nsuddenly begun to doubt the law of gravity or suffered amnesia about the\ncountless prior instances, and needed to test it again and again.\n\n# Pushing Perserverance\n\nOne day, curious whether he even could get bored of knocking the q-tip off my\ndesk, I experimented with replacing the q-tip to see how many times he\u2019d bat\nit off before quitting: it took 15 times before he disdained it & left to do\nother things. What I noticed watching him was that he started by gingerly,\ndelicately prodding it (as if it might scald or bite him) repeatedly with his\nclaws off the table, eventually escalating to batting it off the moment I put\nit down. He was not too interested in the knocking-off part nor the falling\npart, but he would instead carefully watch the fallen q-tip lay there on the\nfloor as it did nothing each time. And his intensity didn\u2019t slacken until the\nend, when he abruptly gave up and stalked away.\n\n# Poking Prey\n\nEventually, I realized: this was not random destruction nor boredom. Rather,\nthis sort of \u2018testing\u2019 was the same way he interacted with live prey!\n\nHe would capture and bring them in to play with them; and when they stopped\nmoving, he would gently prod them with claws to provoke a reaction, escalating\nif they didn\u2019t react, and with an apparently dead animal like a vole or mouse,\nmight scoop it up or fling it around. He was testing them, trying to see\nwhether they were still alive and could be played with, and they might be\nrefusing to move or playing dead, and so a single test is inadequate\u2014one must\npoke them repeatedly, watching for any sign of life.\n\n# Pushing = Play\n\nAnd that\u2019s the same behavior of a cat knocking things off an edge to see what\nhappens. It is not that they truly think that an egg or a q-tip or a\nsmartphone might be prey, any more than they think that the cat toy they are\nchasing is truly living prey animal, but it taps into the same hunting drives\n& play behavior.\n\nIf the object is too large, or too small, then it doesn\u2019t seem prey-like: it\u2019s\nstriking that while cats sometimes knock over large objects like lamps or\ndishes (especially their own food dishes), they seem as surprised & frightened\nas anyone else by the crash. It\u2019s the much smaller, more rat/mouse-sized\nobjects (like eggs), that they tend to deliberately knock-over. And since cats\nneed to play regularly, the knocking-over habit is never permanently satisfied\n& never goes away (but fades away with age with the hunting & play drives).\n\nWe can contrast this with similar behavior in humans, which does go away:\ninfants gleefully knock over glasses or dishes to watch them fall & shatter,\nand it is highly novel to them because they don\u2019t understand the world at all;\nbut as they get older, \u2018push that glass off the table\u2019 becomes boring, and\nteenagers must thrill themselves with more advanced forms of destruction (like\njumping off roofs or posting on social media).\n\n# Predictions\n\nThis can be tested in a similar way as Hallet al2002 tested their toy =\nhunting hypothesis: knocking-over should maximize information about prey-\nobjects (there is no need to test if one already knows the answer), and should\nbe caused by hunting drive, in a way clearly distinguishable from regular\nboredom or random destruction (which would be unaffected by most of these\ntraits or changes).\n\nSo:\n\n  1. Hunting Correlates: anything that increases/decreases hunting should increase/decrease the rates & perseveration of knocking-over behavior, such as time-of-day or hunger or aging or hunting in general (between-individual and between-species) correlating with knocking-over;\n\n  2. Prey-like Objects: cats should prefer to knock over more prey-like objects (such as correctly-sized objects which are not too large or too small; correctly-weighted objects, which are not bizarrely heavy or lightweight; or fur-textured objects more than artificial-textured objects), and also prefer more novel specific objects, and more novel kinds of objects (to learn if they are prey-like);\n\n     * Unnatural is Surprising: cases of cats being frightened or scared by something they deliberately knocked-over should correspond to \u2018unnatural\u2019 outcomes.\n\nPrey would not trigger chain-reactions of falling furniture, nor would a mouse\nhitting the floor splatter the way an egg does (even if an egg is otherwise\nthe right size & density, and wobbles intriguingly)\n\n     * Unexpected is Interesting: objects which are familiar but unexpected in location may also be tempting.^1\n\n  3. Knocking Only Dead Prey: cats should knock-over real prey only if the prey had stopped moving (and they should not knock-over live prey which is still clearly active);\n\n  4. Knocking More Realistic Prey: making knocked-over objects resemble prey playing dead ought to greatly increase knocking-over rates & perseveration (eg. if objects squeaked or rustled when pushed; or if they were \u2018self-righting\u2019 like some toys are; or if objects were rigged to occasionally wiggle briefly after a shock, like an animal struggling to maintain stillness after being hurt badly).\n\nThis effect should be especially strong in indoor-only cats which haven\u2019t been\nto live prey at all: they should engage in little knocking-over before\nexposure to live prey playing-dead, and then do much more afterwards once\nthey\u2019ve learned \u2018playing dead\u2019 is a thing.\n\n     * Uncertainty reduction: One could manipulate time delays to see if cats adjust their observations to be informative: if a knocked-over object wiggles with high probability but only after a long delay, does a cat observe more patiently? If it has a short delay but the probability is lower, do they prefer to instead knock-over more frequently while observing only briefly?\n\n# Uses\n\nIf knocking-over turns out to be play-hunting as well, this would suggest a\nway to cope with destructive knocking-over behavior: offer toys designed to be\nknocked-over & act like playing-dead prey^2\n\nIt would also suggest that if it\u2019s taken us this long to figure out the reason\nfor such a commonly-observed cat behavior, we are bad at understanding cat\nboredom, and that since we have underestimated their boredom levels, we should\nlook for other misinterpreted play-hunting behavior.\n\nCat pondering Hume\u2019s problem of induction. (Experiment in DALL\u00b7E 3 comic\ngeneration.)\n\n  1. One might experiment with objects which unexpectedly pop up, but such motion, as much as it might intrigue a cat, would lead to ambiguous interpretations.\n\n  2. This could tie back into the general toys-should-simulate-hunts-better point\u2014perhaps knocking-over toys could intermittently dispense treats, like on alternating days so a cat cannot simply learn whether a toy does or does not dispense a treat, but must each day knock them over and observe it to learn whether it\u2019s a \u201ctreat-day\u201d?\n\n# Backlinks\n\nBacklinks:\n\n  * Cat itecture: Better Cat Window Boxes (context):\n\n> [backlink context]\n\n  * Cat Psychology & Domestication: Are We Good Owners?
