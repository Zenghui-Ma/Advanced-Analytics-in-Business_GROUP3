The reason pre-M1 was mainly because I wanted to run\nsome local AI models and needed a powerful GPU to do so, my eGPU experiments\nhad failed (and I need Affinity and PowerPoint, so no Linux for me. I gave up\ndual booting after some time).\n\nLuckily - although some parts of Windows are really annoying, settings for\nexample, or bluetooth headsets - there is not too much difference to me,\nmainly because:\n\n    \n    \n    Me OSX: Zsh-Obsidian-Goland-Affinity-PowerPoint-FF Me Windows: Zsh-Obsidian-Goland-Affinity-PowerPoint-FF\n\nWSL has been working for me for some time now, but it was time to upgrade my\nshell.\n\nFollowing some guides, I came up with:\n\n  * Tabby for a better terminal - WSL had some problems with Nerdfonts for me, and CTRL-Space to get Tabby to the front is a really useful and nice feature\n  * lsd for better ls - the icons are nice, and the colors, mostly for the type and age of files\n  * bat for an excellent cat replacement with syntax highlighting - I love this so much, how could I have lived with cat for 30 years with no syntax highlighting and nice line numbers? And it just works, acting as a simple cat if needed, showing its power when it can\n  * fzf for fuzzy search - a lot has been said about this before, it\u2019s a game changer to find a file or directory based on realtime search\n  * zoxide for a better cd - it remembers all directories, instead of cd ..\\\\..\\a\\b\\c you just type cd c. Together with zsh history autocompletion even stronger\n  * zsh and oh my zsh with plugins - autocompletion, better history plugins, syntax highlighting. The problem I had in the past with oh-my-zsh, long startup times, is gone. But it frightens you when your shell has a profiler to profile startup times.\n  * topgrade to update all my coding environments at once - very nice, especially the upgrade of all #Golang and #Rust shell commands I use in development, like air. Before topgrade I did not upgrade them at all.\n  * broot for browsing directories - an alternative to fzf if you don\u2019t remember the directory name\n  * fd for find - Working with find for 30 years, never very happy, fd just works and is faaaaaaast\n  * difftastic for syntactic diffs - Looking for a better diff since years, tried this and that, for now this is my default shell diff (not the UI one)\n\nI wonder now which of these do I need on my Linux production servers. Or does\nthat make them insecure?\n\nOverall very happy now. Colorful, but I like colors. The reason I did like my\nAmstrad CPC more than C64s was the colors even forty years ago.\n\n## Join CTO Newsletter\n\n### Join more than 2600 CTOs and Engineering Managers\n\n### More Stuff from Stephan\n\n## Goals are a Spectrum not a Number\n\n## Let New Hires Write A Todo App\n\n## Procrastination Does Not Exist\n\n## The Mysterious Case of Lost Developer Productivity\n\n## How To Succeed With A Rewrite\n\n## Misconceptions about the CPTO role\n\n## Other interesting articles for CTOs\n\n\u2022 Best books for CTO \u2022 The CTO Book \u2022 Experienced CTO Coach \u2022 Engineering\nManager Coaching \u2022 CTO Mentor \u2022 CTO Mentoring \u2022 CTO Newsletter \u2022 How many\ndevelopers do you need? \u2022 Postgres for Everything Product Roadmaps for CTOs \u2022\nHow to become a CTO in a company - a career path\n\nBooks By Stephan Amazing CTO Book Other Articles\n\n\ud83e\uddb9 We see the AI Endgame for Software Engineering\n\nMisconceptions about the CPTO role\n\nOur Fetish with Failover and Redundancy\n\nToo Many Developers Get Refactoring Wrong\n\nProcrastination Does Not Exist\n\nOther Articles\n\nI'm too old\n\nAutomatic Management to Save Time\n\nBest Books for a CTO\n\nProcrastination Does Not Exist\n\nThree Fundamentals of Software Estimation\n\nMy CTO Book | Contact: stephan@amazingcto.com | Privacy | Impressum\n\n", "frontpage": false}
