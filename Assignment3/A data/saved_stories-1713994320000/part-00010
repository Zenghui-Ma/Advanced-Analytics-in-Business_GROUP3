I\u2019m told they existed well before the web in the\nIRC days. The first notable one I remember, Pastebin.com, was created in 2002\nby Paul Dixon, introducing features like syntax highlighting and private\npastes. Believe it or not, it\u2019s still going strong today. The latest\nincarnation I remember using recently was PostBin (clever: Pastebin for\nWebhooks). It made testing \u201cweb callbacks\u201d remarkably easy.\n\n> Link: https://pastebin.com/raw/HE0EcLUB\n\nOf course, if you are using Git, you know GitHub\u2019s Gist, which launched back\nin 2008. Despite technological advancements, Pastebin's core purpose remains\nthe same: to share text or code snippets online. However, it has had its share\nof security lapses, particularly when unsuspecting users pasted credentials to\nshare a public link via private channels. Just a heads up: Don't do that!\n\nor search runmeinside VS Code\n\n## Runme Gists Are Masked \ud83c\udfad By Default\n\nToday, Runme unlocks the concept of a Pastebin for terminals inside your docs.\nInstead of reinventing wheels, we just combined GitHub Gists, which you likely\nalready use, trust, and love, with Runme\u2019s capabilities to run your Markdown\ndocumentation, capture outputs, and mask (best effort) sensitive data. No copy\n& paste and no other third party required.\n\n> WYSIWYG-editing ahead of Gist creation. Masked Gist:\n> https://gist.github.com/sourishkrout/5129f07b3acc00f44b7b04e741308298\n\nWhether you\u2019re running Bash commands, Python snippets, visualizing VMs running\nin us-east-1, or running a query inside BigQuery, Runme can securely capture\nmasked (default; optional) \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of working notebook sessions. These\nare incredibly useful for sharing with your team or for keeping a personal\nrecord.\n\nBy default, Runme creates \"Secret Gists\" (aka unlisted) with best-effort\nmasking enabled. Although masking can be easily toggled and manual redaction\nis supported ahead of Gist creation, we still advise you to be cautious when\nsharing your Gist links.\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 No Copy & Paste and No Other Third Party\n\nLet\u2019s see Runme Gists hosted inside your GitHub in action.\n\n> The demo video\u2019s artifacts:\n\n  * Notebook: https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/blob/main/examples/gist.md\n  * Masked: https://gist.github.com/sourishkrout/5129f07b3acc00f44b7b04e741308298\n  * Unmasked: https://gist.github.com/sourishkrout/b175b3ed48715b3157a17b037add3282\n\nor search runmeinside VS Code\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 How It Works\n\nRunme\u2019s Gist feature seamlessly integrates into the notebook workflow.\nActivate Auto-Save to capture outputs and run your notebook cells. Be sure to\nupgrade to Runme for VS Code v3.4.0.\n\n> Session Outputs won\u2019t show up unless Auto-Save is enabled\n\nComplete running cells and be sure to finally save the notebook file whenever\nthe file is marked unsaved. This will make sure to synchronize both the\noriginal notebook as well as the Session Outputs files. Click Session Outputs\nto inspect the locally recorded session before, after, or in between, notebook\nruns. If you\u2019re looking to record distinct sessions be sure to click Reset\nSession in between.\n\n> Toggle between Masked and Unmasked Session Outputs\n\nDecide if you want your Session Outputs to be optionally unmasked. The default\nis to mask sensitive information on a best-effort basis using the open-source\ndata-guardian library. Since the library might not catch \"everything,\" and you\nlikely have specific criteria for what needs redaction, feel free to edit the\nSession Outputs file as necessary.\n\nPlease note that the purpose of editing Session Outputs is to generate a Gist.\nSubsequent runs of the same session will overwrite manual edits, so use the\nReset Session function if you want to preserve prior results. Creating a\nGitHub Gist now is as simple as clicking on Generate Gist.\n\n> Link to Gist:\n> https://gist.github.com/sourishkrout/9c079a68fc0801a6bf7fe8a71366dd63\n\nRunme will first prompt you to log into your GitHub account and grant write\naccess to your Gists. After successful login, it will display a notification\ncontaining a link to the Runme Gist hosted inside your GitHub.\n\nor search runmeinside VS Code\n\n## Runme Gist \ud83e\udd29 Inside Your GitHub\n\nThe link is generated as \"Secret Gist\" which, as long as you keep the link\nprivate, will stay private. As always, think twice before sharing.\n\n> Link to Gist:\n> https://gist.github.com/sourishkrout/9c079a68fc0801a6bf7fe8a71366dd63\n\n## That\u2019s it \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCongrats! Save, share, and collaborate with your team. Needless to say, it is\nalso entirely possible to keep the Session Output files offline and local.\nRead about it here.
