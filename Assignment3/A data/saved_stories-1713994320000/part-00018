Gitlin - 4/24/2024, 1:16 PM\n\nEnlarge / Tesla shares rose by almost 11 percent in premarket trading despite\nthe disastrous financial results.\n\nCFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n186\n\nTesla had a terrible first quarter of 2024, according to its financial\nresults, posted yesterday. We already knew that it was a bad three months in\nterms of delivering cars\u2014the automaker built tens of thousands of cars it\ncouldn't sell as deliveries dropped by 8.5 percent, year on year. If anything,\nthe quarterly results paint an even worse picture.\n\nThe company has been engaged in a series of heavy price cuts, and that's\nshowing up on the balance sheet. For all of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's statements\nabout artificial intelligence being the future of the company, the vast\nmajority of its income is still derived from automotive sales. These amounted\nto $16.5 billion in Q1, nearly $2.5 billion less than for Q1 2023. (Regulatory\ncredits remain pretty steady at $442 million for the quarter.)\n\nTotal revenues were down by 9 percent, year on year, with gross profits down\n18 percent. But the net profit, once generally accepted accounting measures\nwere applied, fell by 55 percent to $1.1 billion. (Non-GAAP net profit was\ndown 48 percent.)\n\nTesla's net cash dropped by 90 percent during the first three months of this\nyear, and its free cash flow has been wiped out, dropping 674 percent, year on\nyear. Meanwhile, its supply of inventory\u2014cars its built but hasn't sold\u2014grew\nfrom 15 days to 28 days, accounting for a third of the cars it built during\nthe three-month period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps most alarmingly for those who claimed Tesla was different to other\nautomakers has been the decline in the company's once-envied profit margin.\nThis has been on a steady slide as the company's price war took hold, but for\nQ1 2024 it stands at just 5.5 percent, almost half the industry average.\n\nIn fact, the true picture may be slightly worse. When customers pay Tesla for\nits FSD driving option, it has deferred that revenue. But as it adds more\nfeatures to FSD\u2014most recently automated parking\u2014it has been recognizing that\nrevenue, almost all of which is profit. For Q1, the automaker says it\nrecognized $281 million of deferred revenue, and it expects to recognize an\nadditional $848 million during the remainder of 2024.\n\nTesla fans hoping to hear good news about a $25,000 Model 2 went home\ndisappointed. While Tesla refers to \"more affordable models\" in its outlook,\nquestions about a cheaper Tesla received short-shrift from the CEO, who\nrebuffed inquiries by saying that \"I think we\u2019ve said all we will on that\nfront.\"\n\nRather, the company plans to continue cutting costs from its existing Model 3\nand Model Y. Tesla \"will use aspects of the next-generation platform as well\nas aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the\nsame manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup,\" Musk claimed.\n\nThere is still no clear timeline on when replacements for these models might\nappear, although Tesla has just returned the Model 3 Performance to sale.\nInstead of developing new models, Musk continues to maintain that Tesla's\nfuture is in AI. It spent $1 billion on GPUs in Q1\u2014almost as much as it spent\non total R&D during the same time.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n186\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
