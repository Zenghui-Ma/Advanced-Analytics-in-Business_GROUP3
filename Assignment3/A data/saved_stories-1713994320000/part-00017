Medusa was responsible for 99 breaches\nin the US, UK, Canada, Italy, and France last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecurity teams would pick up on alerts about a pending attack, but the average\nuser would only become aware of one when they were locked out of their\ncomputer system, said Hanah-Marie Darley, director of threat research from\ncyber security firm Darktrace.\n\nA file, with the subject line !!!READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txt., would instruct the\nuser to log on to the dark web and start ransom negotiation with the gang\u2019s\n\u201ccustomer service.\u201d If victims refuse, the cyber attackers publish the stolen\ndata.\n\nCyber security companies monitor the dark web for information and then set up\n\u201choneypots\u201d\u2014fake websites that mimic attractive targets\u2014in developing nations\nto catch experimental attacks at an early stage.\n\nWhen a group of cyber attackers this year began discussing a new\nvulnerability, named CVE-2024-29201, they \u201cspecifically targeted a few\n[exposed servers] in third world countries to test out how reliable the\nexploit was,\u201d said Izrael from Armis, whose analysts were monitoring the\ngang\u2019s conversations on the dark web.\n\nAttacks on Armis\u2019 honeypots 11 days later confirmed the suspicions: The gang\nonly hit Southeast Asia, before using the techniques at a later stage more\nwidely.\n\nSherrod DeGrippo, the director of threat intelligence strategy at Microsoft,\nhowever, said some cyber gangs were too \u201copportunistic\u201d to test new attacks so\nmethodically.\n\nRather, developing countries had experienced increased activity as hackers in\npoorer countries could buy cheap ransomware and stage their own small attacks,\nDeGrippo said.\n\nGangs such as Medusa had begun selling their inventions to less sophisticated\nhackers, said Darktrace director Darley. Those smaller-scale hackers often did\nnot know how the tech works and used it against easier targets, she said.\n\nAny attackers taking the time to \u201csandbox their techniques\u201d\u2014to experiment in\nrelatively unguarded cyber zones in developing countries\u2014were more\nsophisticated, she added.\n\nTeresa Walsh, chief intelligence officer at global cyber threat intelligence\nbody FS-ISAC, said gangs would work within the local environment to \u201cperfect\u201d\nattack methods, she said, and then \u201cexport\u201d their schemes to countries where\nthe same language might be spoken: Brazil to Portugal, for example.\n\nThe speed of digital adoption in Africa is \u201coutpacing the development of\nrobust cyber security measures, and general awareness of cyber threats is\nlow,\u201d said Brendan Kotze, cyber analyst at Performanta.\n\n\u201cCombined, this creates a worrying, widening gap in defenses cyber criminals\nare exploiting,\u201d he added.\n\nEllesheva Kissin is a reporter at Banking Risk and Regulation, a service from\nFT Specialist.\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Financial Times Ltd.
