Twenge\n\nApr 24, 2024\n\n28\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Suicide Rates Are Now Higher Among Young Adults Than the Middle-Aged\n\nwww.afterbabel.com\n\n7\n\nShare\n\nIntroduction from Jon Haidt and Zach Rausch:\n\nToday, we are reposting an important new essay from Jean Twenge\u2019s Substack,\nGeneration Tech, which she wrote in response to a claim made by some\nresearchers who are skeptical of our efforts to call attention to the\nadolescent mental health crisis and link it to the arrival of the phone-based\nchildhood. These skeptics say that we are focusing too much on some\ndemographic groups, such as teens, and especially younger teen girls, who have\ncomparatively low suicide rates, while we say little about other groups, such\nas middle-aged men, who historically have had the highest rates of suicide.\n\nIt is certainly true that the absolute rates of suicide in the U.S. are lowest\nin pre-teen girls, compared to other groups, but we don\u2019t see that fact as any\ncritique of our work because what first caught Jean Twenge\u2019s attention in her\nbook iGen, was the sudden change in so many indicators of mental health for\nteens, which began right around 2012 or 2013. As Zach and I joined with Jean\nto extend this research, we have repeatedly found that the group with the\nlargest relative change (or percentage change) is the younger teen girls,\nwhich we take to be an important clue in addressing the scientific mystery:\nwhat changed in the early 2010s, in the lives of teens?\n\nAll along, we have noted that the absolute rates of suicide are higher for\nboys and men than for girls and women, which makes suicide prevention among\nboys and men extremely urgent (see Richard Reeves\u2019 important work on this at\nthe American Institute for Boys and Men). Also, all along, we have taken it\nfor granted that the highest rates of suicide are found in middle-aged men\nbecause that has been true for so long. But as Jean shows in this new essay:\nThat is no longer true. The rise in suicide among Gen Z in the U.S. is so big\nthat it is now Gen Z males, ages 20-24, who have the highest rates of suicide.\nThis is an important new discovery, and is additional evidence against claims\nthat the youth mental health crisis is exaggerated and that we\u2019re focusing on\nthe wrong groups.\n\n\u2014 Jon and Zach\n\nShare\n\nWhen discussing age and suicide, it\u2019s become near-gospel to note that suicide\nrates are highest among the middle-aged. \u201cSuicide rates highest among middle-\naged men,\u201d read the headline of a 2017 NBC News article. The website for the\nadvocacy group Samaritans says, \u201cMiddle-aged men are more likely to die by\nsuicide than any other age group.\u201d In reference to the increasing suicide rate\nfor young people, psychologists Chris Ferguson and Patrick Markey countered\nthat \u201cSuicides are higher among middle-aged adults.\u201d\n\nNot anymore.\n\nFigure 1. Suicide rate among U.S. adults ages 20-59, by decade of age,\n2007-2021 Source: WISQARS fatal injury database, CDC. Graphed by Jean Twenge\nfor the Generation Tech Substack.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the suicide rate among Americans in their 20s or 30s was\nhigher than the suicide rate among those in their 40s or 50s (see Figure 1;\n2021 is the most recent data available).\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, suicide fell among middle-aged adults and continued to\nrise among younger adults. The end result was the reversal of the long-\naccepted statistic that more middle-aged Americans take their own lives than\nyounger adults.\n\nBut is it still true that the highest suicide rate is among middle-aged men?\nThat\u2019s what headlines have often noted.\n\nIt is not. The highest suicide rate is now among younger men (see Figure 2).\nSuicide rates for middle-aged men fell precipitously after 2018 while those\nfor younger men rose. Until men reach 75 or older, when suicides rise due to\nterminal illness, the highest suicide rates are now among men in their 20s \u2013\nnot the middle-aged.\n\nFigure 2. Suicide rate among U.S. men 20-59, by decade of age, 2007-2021.\nSource: WISQARS fatal injury database, CDC. Graphed by Jean Twenge for the\nGeneration Tech Substack.\n\nThere\u2019s also a striking pattern among women: The suicide rate among middle-\naged women fell after 2019 while the rate for younger women continued to rise\n(see Figure 3). Middle-aged women are still more likely to take their own\nlives than younger women, but the gap has narrowed considerably.\n\nFigure 3. Suicide rate among U.S. women 20-59, by decade of age, 2007-2021.\nSource: WISQARS fatal injury database, CDC. Graphed by Jean Twenge for the\nGeneration Tech Substack.\n\nIn its fatal injury tables, the CDC offers a grim statistic: years of\npotential life lost. In 2021, the years of life lost to suicide among 50- to\n59-year-olds in the U.S. was 80,660. Because 20- to 29-year-olds are younger\nand their suicide rate is now higher, their years of potential life lost are\n347,611\u2013 more than four times as many.\n\nMost obviously, suicide prevention efforts need to focus more on younger men\nthan they do now. The increasingly high rates of depression and self-harm\namong teen girls and young women also demand our attention.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth examining the reason behind the good news: Why did suicide\ndecline among Americans in their 50s in 2020-2021? The most obvious\nexplanation is the changes wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, although a\ndecline in suicide is exactly opposite to the significant rise in suicide many\npredicted. Perhaps there was a silver lining to the pandemic for those in\ntheir 50s, especially those who worked from home and spent more time with\ntheir families. The pandemic may have also created a greater appreciation for\nlife, especially among the middle-aged. Only time will tell if the lower\nsuicide rate among those in their 50s was a blip due to the pandemic or a\nlonger-standing trend with other causes as well.\n\nIt is imperative to recognize that not all of the news is good. These\nstatistics increase the urgency of determining what has gone wrong for Gen Z\nand younger Millennials: They are not only depressed but are taking their own\nlives at high rates. Despite the statements of critics, focusing on the mental\nhealth of teens and young adults is not a moral panic. It is now a mandate.\n\n### Generation Tech\n\nPsychologist and author Jean M.

Your article admits that it is\nbasically an emergency to focus help on boys and men since they are by far the\nmost likely to suicide but instead the article focuses on the increase in\ngirls suicide. This is an important increase but let's focus on those who are\nmost likely to commit suicide. Why no help there?Why no articles there? Well,\nbecause gynocentrism.
