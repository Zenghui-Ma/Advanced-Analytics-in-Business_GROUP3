Marion Fourcade and Kieran Healy argue that technologies of\ninformation management, fueled by the abundance of personal data and the\ninfrastructure of the internet, transform how we relate to ourselves and to\neach other through the market, the public sphere, and the state.\n\nThe personal data we give in exchange for convenient tools like Gmail and\nInstagram provides the raw material for predictions about everything from our\npurchasing power to our character. The Ordinal Society shows how these\nalgorithmic predictions influence people\u2019s life chances and generate new forms\nof capital and social expectation: nobody wants to ride with an unrated cab\ndriver anymore or rent to a tenant without a risk score. As members of this\nsociety embrace ranking and measurement in their daily lives, new forms of\nsocial competition and moral judgment arise. Familiar structures of social\nadvantage are recycled into measures of merit that produce insidious kinds of\nsocial inequality. While we obsess over order and difference\u2014and the logic of\nordinality digs deeper into our behaviors, bodies, and minds\u2014what will hold us\ntogether? Fourcade and Healy warn that, even though algorithms and systems of\nrationalized calculation have inspired backlash, they are also appealing in\nways that make them hard to relinquish.\n\nSee the table of contents and read the first twenty pages. (PDF)\n\n# ADVANCE PRAISE\n\n## Karen Levy\n\nAuthor of Data Driven\n\nThe Ordinal Society will enter the pantheon, both as a work of cross-cutting\nsocial theory and as a clear-eyed reflection on the stakes of digital\ntechnology. Marshalling an astonishing range of theoretical and empirical\nknowledge to build their argument, Fourcade and Healy compellingly demonstrate\njust how integral measurement and ranking have become to markets, politics,\nculture, and the very fabric of social life. And they manage to do it with\nboth rigor and style; this book is both intellectually rewarding and a true\npleasure to read.\n\n## Thomas Piketty\n\nAuthor of A Brief History of Equality and Capital in the Twenty First Century\n\nUnder digital capitalism, social interaction itself has become the target of\nprivate appropriation and capital accumulation. Marion Fourcade and Kieran\nHealy show how sociality has been corralled and monetized in the ordinal\nsociety\u2015a society that may soon prove to be unbearable to most. A must-read.\n\n## Frank Pasquale\n\nAuthor of The Black Box Society\n\nIf any work can advance contemporary social theory for our age of AI and bring\nit to a wide audience, it is The Ordinal Society. With the elegant theory of\nordinality as a common thread uniting disparate phenomena, Fourcade and Healy\nsort out key paradoxes of digitality, particularly the way in which\ncomputation simultaneously promotes democratization and hierarchy. This\nimportant book deserves to have a lasting influence in sociology and beyond.\n\n## Natasha Sch\u00fcll\n\nAuthor of Addiction by Design\n\nAn incisive, crystalline account of how the tracking and scoring of personal\ndata has come to modulate contemporary existence\u2015not only its dreary routines,\ncreepy supervisions, and troublesome extractions and biases, but also its\nexperiences of delight, connection, and effervescence. Essential reading for\nunderstanding the hold of digital ordering on our world, and for thinking up\nways to loosen its grip.\n\n## Gabriel Zucman\n\nCoauthor of The Triumph of Injustice\n\nThis groundbreaking and revelatory book illuminates the seismic social changes\nprovoked by the ubiquity of data. Marion Fourcade and Kieran Healy show how in\nthis new ordinal society, where everything and everyone is ranked, social\nstratification is created, codified, and in the end legitimized like never\nbefore. Far-reaching and deeply researched, this is an absolute must-read for\nanyone who wants to understand inequality in the twenty-first century.\n\n## Fred Turner\n\nAuthor of From Counterculture to Cyberculture\n\nWith precision and eloquence, Kieran Healy and Marion Fourcade map the\ntectonic forces driving the digitization of everyday life. If you want to know\nwhere the fault lines are\u2015and how they got there\u2015read this book.\n\n## Karen Levy\n\nAuthor of Data Driven\n\nThe Ordinal Society will enter the pantheon, both as a work of cross-cutting\nsocial theory and as a clear-eyed reflection on the stakes of digital\ntechnology.
