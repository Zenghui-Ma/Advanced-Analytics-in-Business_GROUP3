SemiAccurate doesn\u2019t use these words lightly but there is no\ndenying what multiple sources are telling us.\n\nLets start out with some disclaimers, the most obvious being how much we are\nblurring out a lot of the details. We are doing this for several reasons, the\nmain one is that we facilitated some questions between OEMs and Qualcomm\nengineers which may point to a source if we aren\u2019t careful. Anonymity of our\nsources will always come first.\n\nSecond is the briefings or lack thereof. At the Hawaii conference last fall,\nQualcomm basically dodged every technical question asked. Both SemiAccurate\nand many others were promised that before launch there would be deep technical\nbriefings to answer these questions and more. Today is the launch. Qualcomm\nlied. At least they lied to us, we haven\u2019t had the chance to talk to others wo\ngot the same line but, well, we doubt they kept their word at all.\n\nThen there were the actual \u2018briefings\u2019 for the X Pro SoC. To call them\npathetic is giving them more than their due. The deck was 11 slides, three of\nwhich were empty/fluff, five \u2018benchmark\u2019 slides with woefully inadequate\ndisclosure, and two infographic summary slides. The last was the slide below\nwith the \u2018deep technical\u2019 stats, much of which we told you about last week.\nAnd more.\n\nIt is really this bad\n\nThe rest of the \u2018disclosure\u2019 for Snapdragon X Pro was a list of features that\nall fall under the guise of exactly what you would expect. The rest was filled\nwith deep \u2018details\u2019 like the GPU capabilities of 3.8TFLOPS. Thats it. No\nspecs, no capabilities, no nothing. It was truly pathetic. But wait there is\nmore, or less really, with statements like it having AV1 encode and decode.\nTrivialities like frame rates and resolutions were seemingly not needed for\nsuch technical briefs. See what we mean by pathetic? Those 10 cores are\narranged how again? That 42MB of cache is what level? Shall I go on about the\nbare minimum basics or do you get the point now?\n\nSemiAccurate was planning to ask Qualcomm about their cheating on benchmarks\nat the promised briefing but, well, they lied to us and cut us out of the\npathetic bits they did brief on. We honestly would have liked to know why they\nwere cheating but we kind of think they will do their usual response to bad\nnews and pretend it never happened like last time. If they actually do explain\nthings we will of course update this article as we always do.\n\nSo what are they cheating on? The short version is that the numbers that they\nare showing to the press and are not achievable with\n\nthe settings they claim. Qualcomm is showing a different set of numbers to\nOEMs and these also are not achievable with the settings they claim. This\ninformation comes from two tier 1 OEMs and other sources. (Note to Qualcomm:\nNo it wasn\u2019t him, really, we knew long before last week) SemiAccurate is 100%\nconfident in saying that some of the numbers Qualcomm was showing off can not\nbe reproduced with the settings they claim. More on it in a bit but first a\nlittle background.\n\nLast fall when Qualcomm was briefing on the Snapdragon X Elite SoC, their\nbenchmarks and claims lacked the bare minimum disclosure to verify the\nnumbers. We brought this up with Qualcomm and to their credit they took big\nsteps to rectify the issue. They did the right thing for the right reasons,\nnot perfect but vastly improved. Well done. Then for MWC they regressed badly.\nThis time around they put up five benchmark slides with claims of vast\nsuperiority over Apple, AMD, and Intel CPUs but without the minimum disclosure\nneeded to check those claims. Any guesses why?\n\nThe why is because if you knew what was being tested and could recreate the\ntests, you could get vastly lower numbers. In Hawaii last fall they showed\nbenchmarks running and according to our sources those were relatively clean.\nThat said given the woeful state of WART (Windows on ARM) they were far from\nfinal. The silicon was either final or very close to it, the software not so\nmuch. That said no journalists were allowed to run anything, test anything, or\neven check the settings, it was presented as a black box. Again Qualcomm said\nwe would have ample time before the launch to get briefs, test, and all that.\nOnce again they lied.\n\nStep forward a little in time. After OEMs got initial samples and made\nsomething close to the final designs, SemiAccurate got reports of poor\nperformance. By poor we mean far sub-50% of the numbers Qualcomm was telling\nthem in the technical docs and presentations. Trying to help we told some\nQualcomm engineers about the findings and asked if there were any known issues\nwith the silicon that would cause this. They repeated the claim that the\nsilicon was clean, something we still believe to be true, but the state of\nWART was horrific. We also believe this to be true. They asked us to pass back\nto the OEMs that likely culprits were cooling and having the right benchmark\nbuild that was ARM native. Both are fair comments and we passed that back.\nThen silence for a while.\n\nLater, with more Snapdragon X Elite samples in the wild and many more\nrevisions of WART, we got similar reports from OEMs and another Tier 1. Both\nreported numbers that were nowhere close to what Qualcomm promised. How not\nclose? Above 50% this time but one used the term \u2018Celeron\u2019 to describe\nperformance. The claims of better than Apple\u2019s Rosetta 2 x86 emulation are\nclearly not real on what is probably the release hardware and software.\nActually the silicon emulation may be better but everything else is\nunquestionably not.\n\nTwo major OEMs with serious engineering capabilities are strong evidence but\nnot proof. Here is where we will blur things out more than we like, sorry\nabout that. A while back we were digging on performance or lack thereof in\npreparation for the promised briefings. A deep source at Qualcomm told us that\nthe benchmarks were cheats, told us how they were cooked, and told us that\nQualcomm was well aware of it. This same technique meant the numbers looked\nfar better than they could be on a non-trivial set of tests. Ironically some\nother benchmarks could have looked much better than those presented if\nQualcomm adequately disclosed their testing details. Lose some, lose some, but\nno winning here.\n\nWe realize it is anecdotal but Qualcomm won\u2019t let anyone do independent\ntesting on these parts. Windows on ARM is still said to be in a painfully\nawful state, or perfect by Microsoft standards. We are weeks away from the\nofficial announcement on May 20th at Build and the laptops are going on sale\nin June. If you take build time, shipping, and all the rest into account, what\nsoftware and hardware we have now is what you are going to see in the stores,\nor really really really close to it. There is no excuse for not letting\nindependent sites test the hardware other than the obvious bits this story is\nabout. Qualcomm wants to control the message and has a host of social media\ninfluencers primed and ready to go. Curious that. Or not.\n\nIn the end the problem is simple. You have a product with promised performance\nthat is not achievable with the claimed settings. Because the claims can\u2019t be\nindependently verified, the influencers will parrot back how \u2018good\u2019 the\nproduct is based on something we know is not true. Between the initial\npublicity blitz and the time things go on sale, the cheating values will\nbecome \u2018truth\u2019 and few if any will question them months down the road. Cynical\nhardly begins to describe this mechanism. The most interesting part is whether\nOEMs will parrot back numbers they know they can\u2019t replicate or release their\nown. Time will tell.\n\nWhat more is there to say? Qualcomm has been making promises about disclosure\nand testing for about six months now. They have broken every one of those and\nat least to SemiAccurate, repeatedly lied. Because of this the digging we have\nbeen doing since before the Hawaii disclosure, some of which lead to this\nolder article, has kept us focused on how these benchmark claims were\ncheating. While we don\u2019t use this term lightly, we are absolutely sure that\nQualcomm is doing exactly that with their numbers. Worse yet they know the\nreasons why the numbers are tainted but continue to present them to OEMs and\nthe press. The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite/Pro SoCs still seem to be very good\nsilicon, everything above that is the polar opposite.S|A\n\nThe following two tabs change content below.\n\n  * Bio\n  * Latest Posts\n\n#### Charlie Demerjian\n\nRoving engine of chaos and snide remarks at SemiAccurate\n\nCharlie Demerjian is the founder of Stone Arch Networking Services and\nSemiAccurate.com.
