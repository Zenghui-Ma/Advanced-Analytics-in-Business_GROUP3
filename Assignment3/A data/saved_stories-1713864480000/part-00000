Every curve of constant width can\nbe accurately approximated by Reuleaux polygons. They have been applied in\ncoinage shapes.\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\nIf is a convex polygon with an odd number of sides, in which each vertex is\nequidistant to the two opposite vertices and closer to all other vertices,\nthen replacing each side of by an arc centered at its opposite vertex produces\na Reuleaux polygon. As a special case, this construction is possible for every\nregular polygon with an odd number of sides.^[1]\n\nEvery Reuleaux polygon must have an odd number of circular-arc sides, and can\nbe constructed in this way from a polygon, the convex hull of its arc\nendpoints. However, it is possible for other curves of constant width to be\nmade of an even number of arcs with varying radii.^[1]\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\nThe Reuleaux polygons based on regular polygons are the only curves of\nconstant width whose boundaries are formed by finitely many circular arcs of\nequal length.^[3]\n\nEvery curve of constant width can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a\n(possibly irregular) Reuleaux polygon of the same width.^[1]\n\nFour 15-sided Reinhardt polygons, formed from four different Reuleaux polygons\nwith 9, 3, 5, and 15 sides\n\nA regular Reuleaux polygon has sides of equal length. More generally, when a\nReuleaux polygon has sides that can be split into arcs of equal length, the\nconvex hull of the arc endpoints is a Reinhardt polygon. These polygons are\noptimal in multiple ways: they have the largest possible perimeter for their\ndiameter, the largest possible width for their diameter, and the largest\npossible width for their perimeter.^[4]\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\nThe constant width of these shapes allows their use as coins that can be used\nin coin-operated machines. For instance, the United Kingdom has made 20-pence\nand 50-pence coins in the shape of a regular Reuleaux heptagon.^[5] The\nCanadian loonie dollar coin uses another regular Reuleaux polygon with 11\nsides.^[6] However, some coins with rounded-polygon sides, such as the\n12-sided 2017 British pound coin, do not have constant width and are not\nReuleaux polygons.^[7]\n\nAlthough Chinese inventor Guan Baihua has made a bicycle with Reuleaux polygon\nwheels, the invention has not caught on.^[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Martini, Horst; Montejano, Luis; Oliveros, D\u00e9borah (2019), \"Section 8.1: Reuleaux Polygons\", Bodies of Constant Width: An Introduction to Convex Geometry with Applications, Birkh\u00e4user, pp. 167\u2013169, doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03868-7, ISBN 978-3-030-03866-3, MR 3930585, S2CID 127264210\n  2. ^ Alsina, Claudi; Nelsen, Roger B.
