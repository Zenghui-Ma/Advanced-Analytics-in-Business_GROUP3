fuel heating systems.\n\nAndrew Aitchison | In Pictures | Getty Images\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, heat pumps are hot. Although these devices, which\nuse electricity to generate both air conditioning and heat, have been around\nfor decades, the latest models are much more efficient and cost-effective\nalternatives to conventional fossil-fuel furnaces and air conditioners.\n\nBut there are other reasons why heat pumps are fast becoming popular with\nhomeowners. The federal government, as well as an increasing number of states,\nare offering consumers attractive tax credits and rebates for buying and\ninstalling heat pump systems as a way to reduce climate-warming greenhouse gas\nemissions and propel the transition to renewable energy.\n\nAll of this is transforming Carrier Global, the nearly 100-year-old\nmanufacturer whose founder, Willis Carrier, invented air conditioning. Over\nthe past year, the Palm Beach Gardens, Florida-based company has been\nrepositioning itself to capitalize on the fast-growing market for heat pumps\nand other sustainable heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC)\ntechnologies.\n\n\u201cWe all know that sustainability is a megatrend,\u201d Carrier Global Chairman and\nCEO David Gitlin told a group of investors in February. \u201cHVAC has to have a\ncritical seat at the table.\u201d\n\nAfter being spun off from United Technologies \u2014 its parent since 1979 \u2014 in\n2020, and then divesting several non-HVAC businesses, Carrier made its biggest\nbet yet on the heat pump boom when it acquired Germany\u2019s Viessmann Climate\nSolutions for roughly $13 billion last April. In addition to proprietary heat\npump technology, Viessmann offers renewable energy capabilities and home\nbattery storage, as well as smart home system controls and applications that\ncan be integrated to drive energy efficiency.\n\n\u201cHVAC is at an inflection point right now, with a tremendous shift toward\nelectrification, going from fossil fuel-burning boilers and furnaces to heat\npumps,\u201d said Hakan Yilmaz, Carrier\u2019s chief technology and sustainability\nofficer. \u201cIn addition, the cooling side of HVAC is expected to triple by 2050,\nbecause 2.8 billion people live in hot climate zones and only about 8% have\naccess to HVAC today,\u201d he said. The massive scale and massive consumption of\nthe energy resiliency issue, Yilmaz says, puts the HVAC industry in a position\nto capitalize.\n\n### Heat pumps have a history dating back to 1850s\n\nThe thermodynamic science behind heat pumps was developed in the 1850s, when\nthe first ones were invented, and they\u2019ve been used in homes since the 1960s.\nHeat pumps use electricity to transfer heat from a cool space to a warm space,\nmaking the cool space cooler and the warm space warmer. Many of today\u2019s models\nare three to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel furnaces, and work\nwell even in extremely cold and hot weather.\n\nThe most common type is the air-source heat pump system, comprising an outdoor\nunit \u2014 which resembles a conventional central AC device \u2014 and an indoor unit\nthat hooks up to either a blower that circulates warm or cool air through\nducts and vents or to one or more ductless mini-splits installed in rooms\nthroughout a house.\n\n14 February 2024, Saxony, Leipzig: Michael Kretschmer (r, CDU), Minister\nPresident of Saxony, talks to Viessmann employee Sebastian Kowalski about a\nheat pump at the Haus-Garten-Freizeit trade fair. Kretschmer takes part in the\nEast Trade Policy Forum.\n\nPicture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nCompared to a gas boiler, heat pumps reduce GHG emissions by 20% when\noperating on fossil fuel-generated electricity and as much as 80% when\noperating on cleaner electricity, according to the International Energy\nAgency. Residential and commercial buildings account for 30% of global energy\nconsumption and produce 26% of energy-related GHG emissions, per the IEA.\n\nIn 2023, air-source heat pumps outsold fossil-fuel furnaces for the second\nyear in a row, according to AHRI, the trade association representing HVAC\nmanufacturers. Rewiring America, a nonprofit advocate for mass-scale\nelectrification, estimates that currently, 16% of U.S. homes use heat pumps\nfor heating and cooling. In September, the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan\ncoalition of 25 governors, agreed to collectively reach 20 million heat pump\ninstallations by 2030, with the aim of ensuring at least 40% of benefits flow\nto disadvantaged communities.\n\n### In the U.S., so far cold states are leading the way\n\nAlthough heat pumps have become popular for air conditioning in southern\nstates, Maine has the highest rate of adoption, installing 100,000 units in\nhouseholds two years ahead of schedule and aiming to hook up another 175,000\nby 2027. That dispels the notion, often promulgated by the oil and gas\nindustry and utilities, that heat pumps don\u2019t work well in below-freezing\ntemperatures, thus requiring a fossil-fuel furnace as backup.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s old news,\u201d said Tobie Stanger, senior home and appliances writer for\nConsumer Reports. \u201cThere are new heat pumps designed for cold weather that\nallow them to go to five degrees effectively,\u201d she said, adding that they\u2019re\nwidely used in Nordic and European countries. A Consumer Reports analysis of\nthe efficacy of heat pumps in cold climates found that \u201ceven amid bone-\nchilling cold\u201d they use far less energy than other types of heating systems.\nAccording to Dave Lis, director of technology market transformation at\nNortheast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP), air-source heat pumps can\nwork as a home\u2019s main heating system in almost any climate.\n\nCarrier sells 10 different heat pumps, with various energy capacities and\nprice points, and plans to add models made by Viessmann, which already has a\npresence in the U.S. market. But beyond the company\u2019s sustainable energy\ntechnology and product portfolio, \u201cone of the reasons we acquired Viessmann\nwas because of its experience in training dealers and installers and helping\ncustomers understand the benefits of its products,\u201d said Milena Oliveira,\nCarrier\u2019s chief marketing and communications officer.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:3302:33\n\nCarrier CEO David Gitlin on sustainability and acquiring Viessmann unit\n\nSquawk on the Street\n\nLeveraging that knowledge, Carrier is providing its nationwide network of\naround 2,100 authorized dealers training and education programs, as well as\nadvertising and promotional support, not only regarding heat pumps but also\nancillary products, such as smart thermostats and energy storage batteries.\n\u201cHome energy management is a huge component that we want to capitalize on,\u201d\nOliveira said, as dealers \u201cshift their mindsets from selling products to\nselling solutions and components.\u201d\n\nMark Prodan, the operations manager of M&M Plumbing and Heating, a Carrier\ndealership in the northern Michigan town of Indian River, said that M&M\u2019s heat\npump business grew by nearly 35% last year. \u201cThis year it will probably be up\nanother 40% to 50%,\u201d he said.\n\nProdan said that he typically has to educate customers about the energy\nefficiency and cost-effectiveness of heat pumps, as well as their\nenvironmental benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s a general feeling that people want to go with\na little bit cleaner energy, but once you educate them on what heat pumps can\ndo, they\u2019re usually very receptive,\u201d he said.\n\nCarrier on-site and remote training of M&M\u2019s sales and service staff have\nhelped, Prodan said. \u201cThey have a website with knowledge-based videos,\ncalculators that show customers their cost savings and an app for our service\nguys that can scan a bar code to pull up information and manuals.\u201d\n\n### Getting tax credits and rebates while they last\n\nBetween now and the end of 2032, homeowners can get a 30% federal tax credit\nfor the purchase and installation of Energy Star-certified air-source heat\npumps \u2014 from Carrier and other brands \u2014 up to $2,000 annually. That includes\nany related insulation, ducting, mini-splits and electricity upgrades.\n\nMany states and local utilities offer additional financial incentives, some\ntied to income levels. Connecticut, for instance, offers a rebate of up to\n$15,000 for qualifying heat pumps; New York State issues rebates through\nutility companies that can amount to between $8,000 and $12,000; Maine offers\nbetween $4,000 and $8,000. The Energy Star website features a \u201crebate finder\u201d\nfor obtaining information by zip code.\n\nThe cost of installing a heat pump system \u2014 depending on the brand, size,\nwhere you live and complexity of the job \u2014 can be upward of $20,000. Consumer\nReports member surveys found that the overall median price paid for the\npurchase and installation of a ducted heat pump between 2018 and 2023 was\n$8,348. Mini-splits can range from $2,000 to $6,000 per unit, plus\ninstallation.\n\nBesides rebates and tax credits, heat pumps can generate savings by\neliminating the cost of fossil fuels, even when factoring in the price of\nelectricity. Rewiring America calculated that homeowners switching from\ninefficient HVAC systems that run on fuel oil, propane or traditional electric\nresistance (like baseboard heat or electric furnaces) can save around $1,000\nper year.\n\nFor 2023, Carrier reported sales of $22.1 billion, up 8% from $20.4 billion in\n2022. Its guidance for 2024 projected sales growing to $26.5 billion. The\nstock is up 30% over the past year, though it is stalled in 2024.\n\n### Loading chart...\n\n\u201cThis is a big year for us as a company,\u201d Gitlin said in a recent call with\nanalysts. \u201cWe will start realizing the tremendous benefits from the\ncombination of Viessmann and as a sustainability-focused, higher growth, pure-\nplay company.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I see companies making big changes to their [product] portfolio and\ndivestitures, that puts a premium on management knowhow and capability,\u201d said\nDeane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. \u201cI like how they\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe heat pump [focus] does not just make economic sense, but the impact on\nits carbon footprint is a good part of the story as well.\u201d\n\nCarrier is targeting net-zero GHG emissions in its own operations by 2030 and\nacross its value chain by 2050. The recent stock retreat, Dray says, doesn\u2019t\nconcern him and over the longer term, he anticipates higher margins, more\nservices and more aftermarket revenues. \u201cIt\u2019s all lining up nicely,\u201d he said.\n\n## More In The Bottom Line\n\nThe American dollar store has fallen on hard times\n\nKevin Williams\n\nHow Bombardier is cashing in on business elite\u2019s love affair with private jet\ntravel\n\nBob Woods\n\nMeet the founding members of the CNBC CFO Council\n\nCNBC.com staff\n\nRead More\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
