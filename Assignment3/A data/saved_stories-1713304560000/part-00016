Meet\nAmplication's latest innovation: Custom Types & Actions. Now, you can generate\nproduction-ready code for your custom data structures and API endpoints, and\nmanage relationships between them, all within the intuitive Amplication UI.\n\nWith Custom Types and Actions, you can define and manage all of your APIs in a\nsingle place, offering a single source of truth for your interfaces. You can\nbe sure that all your interfaces are written consistently according to\nindustry standards and best practices, preventing bugs and increasing\nuniformity. Uniformity means that your developers feel familiar inside any of\nyour services and know what to expect. Different teams can easily understand\nthe APIs they need to integrate with because of that uniformity. Developers no\nlonger need to dig through multiple source files to explore the APIs available\nto them; they can just look in Amplication and have an easy view of the entire\nset of APIs along with their inputs and outputs. These things add up to less\nwasting time, and developers who don't need to waste time are happier and more\nproductive.\n\n### Key benefits of Custom Types & Actions\n\nCustom Types & Actions offers unparalleled flexibility and control, making it\neasier than ever to tailor your application precisely to your needs. Here\u2019s a\nquick overview:\n\n  * Intuitive action definition: create custom API endpoints effortlessly.\n  * Flexible DTO creation: define data structures that fit your application\u2019s unique requirements.\n  * Seamless DTO and API management: easily organize and manage your APIs.\n  * Granular control: fine-tune your application\u2019s functionality with ease.\n\n### Unparalleled flexibility with custom DTO creation\n\nAmplication supports a wide array of data types and formats, allowing you to\ncreate Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that are both expressive and precise.\nWhether you're dealing with objects, primitives, arrays, or other DTOs, you\nhave the flexibility to model your data exactly as needed. This customization\nextends to defining custom API endpoints (Actions), including specifying HTTP\nmethods, paths, and input and output DTOs. Our intuitive UI streamlines this\nprocess, saving you time and effort.\n\n### Streamlined workflows with seamless DTO and API management\n\nWithin our dedicated \"APIs\" tab, managing your DTOs and APIs becomes a breeze.\nAmplication automatically organizes your DTOs and APIs into Modules, providing\nclarity and structure. With built-in support for CRUD operations and advanced\nsorting and filtering, integrating custom DTOs and APIs tailored to your\napplication's specific needs has never been easier.\n\n### Granular control\n\nCustom Types & Actions empowers you to exercise complete control over your\napplication's data contracts and API endpoints. Whether you're creating,\ndeleting, enabling, disabling, or editing custom DTOs and Actions, our\nplatform provides the tools you need to adapt your application\u2019s behavior to\nyour evolving needs.\n\nInstantly generate production-ready backend\n\nNever waste time on repetitive coding again.\n\nTry Now\n\n### Getting started is simple\n\nTo begin leveraging Custom Types & Actions, just navigate to the \"APIs\" tab in\nyour Amplication dashboard. Here, you can explore existing DTOs and Actions,\ncreate new ones, and manage your application\u2019s data contracts and API\nendpoints. Our comprehensive developer documentation guides you through every\nstep, from creating and editing DTOs to defining API endpoints.\n\n### We want to hear from you\n\nCustom Types & Actions marks a significant milestone in our mission to\nredefine backend development. Your feedback is invaluable to us. How are you\nplanning to use Custom Types & Actions? What features would you like to see in\nthe future?
