Preliminary data from research\nfirm International Data Corporation (IDC) revealed that Samsung shipped a\nmarket-leading 60 million units, some 20% more than Apple during the same\nperiod.\n\nAlthough Samsung's return to the top spot is not entirely surprising \u2014 iPhone\nsales historically peak in the fourth quarter, and the two smartphone giants\nconstantly tussle for #1 \u2014 what is noteworthy is the nearly 10% year-over-year\ndecline in Apple's sales, as demand for its products in China falls. By\ncontrast, Samsung sales were flat, and overall smartphone shipments grew 8%.\n\nSamsung only has a small foothold in the Chinese market, while Apple was a\nmajor player in the region last year, boasting over 17% market share. And,\nlike in so many other sectors, Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for a\n\u201cMade in China\u201d option, with Apple facing intense competition in the nation\nfrom rivals Transsion and Xiaomi, both of which reported strong double-digit\ngrowth in the most recent quarter. With fewer groundbreaking new features in\nrecent releases, consumers are also holding onto their devices for longer.\n\nApple has been working hard to diversify away from the iPhone, but the product\nremains the primary gateway into the Apple ecosystem and its infamous walled\ngarden \u2014 and the slump in sales comes at a tough time. The recently launched\nVision Pro headset is struggling to gain traction, and the company faces a DOJ\nlawsuit over the iPhone's alleged monopolistic power. All told, the company\u2019s\nshares have lagged the wider market (S&P 500) by 13% this year.\n\n### More Tech\n\nSee all Tech\n\nMax Knoblauch\n\n4/15/24\n\n## Adobe is paying $3 a minute for AI-training video of people touching things\n\nAdobe is pushing its way into the growing business of generative AI video,\njoining OpenAI\u2019s Sora and Google\u2019s Imagen 2.\n\nThe new tools will roll out this year, according to Adobe.\n\nIn contrast to its web-scraping rivals, Bloomberg reported that Adobe is\npaying videographers up to $120 for stock footage used to train the model.\n\nHigh-priority subjects include: footage of people showing emotions, clips of\npeople touching things, and anatomy shots of eyes, hands, and feet.\n\nAI companies are growing increasingly wary of copyright lawsuits, as giants\nlike YouTube threaten possible litigation if AI is trained on their videos.\nPlus: AI is learning so fast that the data used to train it could be\ncompletely tapped by 2026.\n\n### Adobe's working on generative video, too | TechCrunch\n\nHigh-priority subjects include: footage of people showing emotions, clips of\npeople touching things, and anatomy shots of eyes, hands, and feet.\n\nAI companies are growing increasingly wary of copyright lawsuits, as giants\nlike YouTube threaten possible litigation if AI is trained on their videos.\nPlus: AI is learning so fast that the data used to train it could be\ncompletely tapped by 2026.\n\n4/15/24\n\n## South Korea and the US drop billions on chip investments as AI fuels techy\nnationalism\n\nNia Warfield\n\nRead\n\nSHOP\n\nMETA\n\nRani Molla, Tom Jones4/14/24\n\nDating Data\n\n4/13/24\n\n## Love to hate the apps\n\nRani Molla\n\nGen\n\nCrisis\n\nZo\u00eb Schiffer4/12/24\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Latest Stories\n\nNia Warfield\n\n5m\n\n## Dr. Martens gets the boot from traders\n\nShares of Dr. Martens fell 30% and hit an all-time low after the British boot\nbrand warned that sales were heading for a slowdown.

But it ain\u2019t happening. In fact, just released March\nnumbers showed the biggest monthly drop since Covid hit in 2020.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal? Well, housing is a pretty interest-rate sensitive industry.\nThe high rates the Fed put in place to clamp down on inflation have driven up\nmortgage rates. Housing is also hard to build, with some arguing that\nexclusionary zoning is a big part of the problem.\n\nThe lack of supply, high mortgage costs, and price spike that occurred during\nthe pandemic means housing is the most unaffordable it\u2019s been in decades.\n\nYou Bet!\n\n3h\n\n## \u201cI\u2019m a prop\u201d\n\nJack Raines\n\nSponsored by\n\nGo Deeper with Market Depth\n\nNasdaq TotalView powers the need-to-know data serious investors rely on.\n\nRead more\n\nTuesday, April 16th\n\n6h\n\nWhat\u2019s happening\n\n  * \u201cBlowout\u201d March retail sales suggest US economy is still running hot\n\nFinancial Times\n\n  * Shares in Dr. Martens (DOCS) fall more than 30% on weak sales outlook\n\nCNBC\n\n  * Tesla layoffs hit high-performers, as 14k jobs are cut\n\nTechCrunch\n\n  * Homicides in major US cities dropped 20% in the first three months of 2024\n\nAxios\n\n  * Many coral reefs are dying, but this one is exploding with life\n\nVox\n\n  * Microsoft\u2019s other AI play: A $1.5 billion investment in G42\n\nCNBC\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n7h\n\n## Biden cancels $7B+ more in student-loan debt, but forgiveness is only half\nthe battle\n\nNia Warfield\n\nRead\n\n7h\n\n## The UAW drives south as the union makes the most of its Big Three momentum\n\nMax Knoblauch\n\nRead\n\nRebecca Moretti\n\n16h\n\n## Department of Justice investigating Live Nation and Ticketmaster\n\nTaylor Swift fans have beef with Ticketmaster-owner Live Nation, and now the\nUS government does, too: The Justice Department is reportedly getting ready to\nslap America's largest concert promoter with an antitrust suit.\n\nLawmakers and regulators have accused Live Nation of outrageously high ticket\nprices, iffy customer service, and anticompetitive practices.\n\nThe DOJ's investigation into the concert colossus heated up in November 2022,\nwhen Ticketmaster crashed after T.
