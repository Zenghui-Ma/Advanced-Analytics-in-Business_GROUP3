Wait a moment and try again.\n\nThe Quora Blog\n\nThe place for official announcements and other major news from the Quora team\n\nAdam D'Angelo\n\nQuora CEO \u00b7 Mon \u00b7\n\nMulti-bot chat on Poe\n\nToday we are adding an important new capability to Poe: multi-bot chat. This\nfeature lets you easily chat with multiple models in a single thread.\n\nMulti-bot chat is important because different models have different strengths\nand weaknesses. Some are optimized for specific tasks and others have unique\nknowledge. As you query a bot on Poe, you now can compare answers from\nrecommended bots with one click, and summon any bot you prefer by @-mentioning\nthe bot - all within the same conversation thread. This new ability lets you\neasily compare results from various bots and discover optimal combinations of\nmodels to use the best tool for each step in a workflow.\n\nFor example, if you are looking to learn more about a particular subject, you\ncan query Claude 3 Opus and compare the response to GPT-4 or Mistral Large\nwith one click. You can do in-depth analysis with Gemini 1.5 Pro\u2019s 1M token\ncontext window, @-mention Web Search bot into the conversation to pull in up-\nto-date information about the topic, and then bring a specialized writing bot\nin to complete a writing task, using the context from all of the previous\nbots. Or if you are looking to generate an image, you can prompt DALL-E 3 and\ncompare the output to SDXL, Playground v2.5, or any other image generation bot\non Poe.\n\nAI is moving at an incredible pace, and as new models are released, our goal\nis to provide easy ways to interact with them and combine them with all of the\nexisting models. We expect these workflows involving multiple models to become\nincreasingly important as the diversity of the model provider ecosystem\ncontinues to increase.\n\nAnd as this diversity increases, the cost of maintaining multiple\nsubscriptions to all the different model providers keeps increasing. With Poe,\nyou\u2019re able to access all of the most powerful models, and millions of user-\ncreated bots built on top of them, all with a single $20/month subscription.\nWith multi-bot chat, we\u2019re streamlining this even further, enabling you to\ncompare and combine the strengths of these models in a single thread.\n\nWe are so excited about the ability to use multiple bots together on Poe that\nwe have evolved our logo to represent it! This new logo will roll out to the\nPoe apps across all platforms over the coming week:\n\nYou can try multi-bot chat today at https://poe.com/ and across all Poe apps.\nWe are excited to hear all of your feedback and will be incorporating it as we\ncontinue to work hard to make Poe the best place to chat with and combine the\nwide diversity of emerging AI products.\n\n7K views \u00b7\n\nView upvotes\n\n\u00b7\n\nView 9 shares\n\n\u00b7\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAdam D'Angelo\n\nQuora CEO\n\nWorked at Facebook (company)\n\nStudied at California Institute of Technology (Caltech)\n\nLives in Mountain View, CA\n\n40.7M content views120.1K this month\n\nTop Writer2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 1 more\n\nPublished WriterForbes\n\nView more in The Quora Blog\n\nAbout \u00b7 Careers \u00b7 Privacy \u00b7 Terms \u00b7 Contact \u00b7 Languages \u00b7 Your Ad Choices \u00b7\nPress \u00b7\n\n\u00a9 Quora, Inc. 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
