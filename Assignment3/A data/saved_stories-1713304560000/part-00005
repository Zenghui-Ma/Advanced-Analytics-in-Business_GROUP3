Why does this matter?\n\n## Sign up for the Newsletter\n\nOnce a week. Three links. No spam. Unsubscribe anytime.\n\nOne of W. Edwards Deming\u2019s favourite questions was \u201chow would you know?\u201d\n\nHe would often ask this question when presented with some process improvement,\nby some hapless manager, at some industrial company. \u201cHow would you know?\u201d he\nwould ask \u2014 that is, how would you know that your idea has worked?\n\nIf the manager had the misfortune to reply: \u201cusing my experience\u201d, Deming\nwould retort: \u201cand with that, he has revealed himself!\u201d \u2014 that is, the manager\nwas proposing superstition.\n\nDeming taught business operators methods to do better than just superstition.\n\n## How Would You Know?\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking if you \u2014 or your boss \u2014 might do better than the hapless\nmanager above. Think about the last time you:\n\n  * Launched a new marketing campaign?\n  * Changed your software development practices?\n  * Updated your sales enablement material?\n  * Or changed your sales process?\n\nClearly each change you\u2019ve made \u2014 be it a new marketing campaign or\nintroducing full CI/CD or switching to a different lead scoring mechanism \u2014\nyou expect to result in improved outcomes for your business.\n\nBut how would you know if the change has worked?\n\nDid you look at some data after the fact? Did you run a two group \u2018control vs\nintervention\u2019 study and waited for statistical significance? The metrics you\npick will wiggle; do you have a way of separating signal of change from noise?\nHell, did you even pause to evaluate the impact of your changes, so that you\nmay update your intuitions about what might or might not work in the future?\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, I think the odds are good that none of the above\nthings happened; you probably made some change and said \u201cI guess things are\nbetter\u201d. After which everyone moves on to the next thing.\n\nA reader emailed me recently and said that whenever engineering leadership at\nhis company decides on a change in their software engineering practices, the\nmost senior engineers would vanish into a room for weeks or months and then\nemerge \u2014 like Moses descending from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments \u2014\nwith a new set of best practices they would roll out throughout the org.\n\nAnd how would they evaluate if they had successfully changed things? Well,\nthey would use their experience, of course!\n\nI know I make this sound like some bad thing, but this is the way I do things\ntoo. I\u2019m willing to wager this is the way most of us do things in our\ncompanies.\n\n## The Three Questions\n\nIf you read any number of books about Continuous Improvement today, you would\nsee echoes of Deming\u2019s favourite question come up again and again.\n\nHere\u2019s statistician Donald Wheeler, in Chapter 1 of Making Sense of Data:\n\n> Continual Improvement requires a framework. We all need some way to align\n> our efforts and focus on a specific objective. To this end I have found the\n> following questions to be equally helpful.\n>\n> What do you want to accomplish? Until you have a clearly stated objective,\n> you risk everyone running off in different directions, working on their own\n> pet projects, and not cooperating for the common good. Whether it is a\n> specific project with a limited scope, or the general day-to-day operations\n> of your organisation, a clearly stated purpose or objective is important to\n> help focus the thoughts and efforts of everyone involved. (...)\n>\n> By what method will you accomplish your objective? While it may be necessary\n> to have a goal, merely having a goal is, but itself, not sufficient.\n> Remember the old saying, \u201cif wishes were horses then beggars would ride.\u201d\n> Until you have a plan for achieving your objective, it will be nothing more\n> than wishful thinking. All of our targets, all of our goals, and all of our\n> plans are merely wishes and hopes until we have some specific method for\n> making them come true. (...)\n>\n> How you know when you have accomplished your objective? If you are going to\n> have a goal, and if you hope to move towards that goal, then you will also\n> need some way to measure how far you have come and how far you have yet to\n> go in reaching that goal. Moreover, you will need a way to evaluate that\n> measure to determine if a change has occurred.\n\nI call this the \u2018Three Questions of Continuous Improvement\u2019. Wheeler shortens\nit to:\n\n  1. What do you want to accomplish?\n  2. By what method?\n  3. How would you know?\n\nAnd he prints it out at the end of every chapter in Making Sense of Data.\n\n## The Secret\n\nThere\u2019s a secret lying at the heart of continuous improvement, and perhaps\nyou\u2019ve spotted it already.\n\nLet\u2019s back up a bit. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been deep in the weeds on\nbecoming data driven in business: we\u2019ve talked about the ideas of Statistical\nProcess Control, and the ideas of statistician W. Edwards Deming (who created\nboth SPC and Continuous Improvement). I told you how these ideas lay down the\nsimplest path to becoming data driven in business. And last week I announced\nXmrit, a free tool to create XmR charts \u2014 and a free email course that taught\nthe basics so you can replicate that path yourself.\n\nBut at the heart of all of this lies a small set of really simple ideas. If\nyou think about it \u2014 putting aside, for the moment, Deming\u2019s observations\nabout human psychology \u2014 what we have here is really three load-bearing\nconcepts:\n\n  1. The Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle, which was Deming\u2019s frame for trial and error.\n  2. The three questions of Continuous Improvement\n  3. The Process Behaviour Chart.\n\nTogether, they represent a methodology for single subject studies. You now\nhave a method to improve anything: yourself, your body, your department, and\nultimately your business.\n\nLet\u2019s go through them quickly:\n\n### The PDSA Cycle\n\nTrial and error sounds obvious, and simple, but as we\u2019ve seen in a previous\nessay \u2014 something odd happens when you do trial and error in a business\ncontext. Most people do not circle back and ask \u201cwhat, exactly, have we\nlearnt?\u201d\n\nThere are many reasons for this. You\u2019re too busy. A business emergency occurs.\nYou forget. But in so doing, you learn nothing.\n\nDeming found it necessary to teach what we might consider obvious: you make a\nplan, you do the plan, you study the results of your execution, and then you\nact with the results in mind. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you do so, you must answer:\n\n### The Three Questions of Continuous Improvement\n\nThe way I like to remember the three questions is:\n\n  1. What do you want to accomplish?\n  2. How will you accomplish it?\n  3. How will you know you have accomplished it?\n\nIf you squint at these questions, you\u2019d realise the trouble is really with the\nthird question. Most people know what they want to accomplish. Sales leaders\nwant higher sales, product people want higher retention, marketing people want\nattribution, and so on. Similarly, these people will often have proposals for\nhow to accomplish what they want.\n\nComparatively few people have an answer for the third question. Which explains\nwhy Deming gave us:\n\n### The Process Behaviour Chart\n\nThe problem with attempting to answer \u201chow do we know we\u2019ve accomplished it?\u201d\nis variation \u2014 that is, any number you attempt to track will wiggle. This\nwiggling gets in the way of your saying, confidently: \u201cyes, this metric has\nchanged because of what we did\u201d. Without an ability to cut through the noise\nof variation, you won\u2019t be able to use data. Which means you will have to rely\non qualitative judgment: you must wait longer for confirmation; we must read\nthe \u2018vibes\u2019 \u2014 and only the vibes \u2014 which means you may all too easily trick\nyourself.\n\nAn XmR chart for Forum Pageviews\n\nProcess behaviour charts tell you when a metric has changed. They allow you to\nseparate signal from noise. This is why Deming taught them \u2014 he wanted\neveryone to have a default answer to the third question of Continuous\nImprovement.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following Commoncog, you\u2019ll know that we launched a free tool\nto plot process behaviour charts for any business metric you might care for;\nthis is Xmrit. The simplest PBC is the XmR chart. We launched Xmrit because we\nwant everyone to use XmR charts. And we did this because ...\n\n## Why does this matter?\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIn business, as in life, what you really want to know is what works for you.\n\nSure, best practices are great. But they are problematic. A best practice\ndeveloped in the context of another company, at another time, for another\ncompany\u2019s problems, might not translate well to your company, and may not\nsolve your problems. You must always test when you apply best practices \u2014\nwhich means asking \u201chow would you know?\u201d In other words, you need to do a\nsingle subject study where you are the subject.\n\nAnd Deming knew this of course: he always warned against copying best\npractices blindly. He argued that even a little \u2018Theory of Knowledge\u2019 should\nmake you suspicious of another company\u2019s knowledge.\n\nIt seems a little bizarre that knowledge can be gained from studying one\nsubject at a time. When I was a Computer Science student, I watched a famous\ntalk called Bits of Evidence by Greg Wilson. In it, Wilson argued that\nsoftware engineering was like medicine pre-science: we have very little\nknowledge about what works. Wilson made this argument because we did not do\nrandomised controlled trials. We did not base our best practices on actual\nscientific evidence.\n\nYou can already work out the points and the counter points. RCTs are\nextraordinarily time consuming; they are also very expensive to run. What\nworks across multiple companies might not necessarily work for you. But Wilson\nargued that until we were willing to pay this cost, we had no hope of\nknowledge in software engineering. I remember being struck by the strength of\nhis argument and the quality of his talk.\n\nBut I no longer agree with him.\n\nConsider: whilst RCTs are the gold standard in medicine, doctors know that\nwhat has been proven to work in a large study does not mean that it would \u2014\nwith 100% certainty \u2014 work for you. There are always individuals for whom\nparticular drugs might not work; some people develop drug tolerances that\nothers do not; doctors are always saying \u201ctry this, and come back in two\nweeks\u201d for a reason. Pharmacology can say \u201cwe have knowledge that such-and-\nsuch drug will work for disease X for most people\u201d but the exact efficacy and\nthe precise side effects are only observed when you take the drug.\n\nAs a patient, you really only care about what works for you.\n\nContinuous Improvement \u2014 kaizen, if you want to call by its Japanese name \u2014\nsounds trite. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that it is a secret. But in\ntruth, I have never learnt the combination of the three ideas I just gave you;\nmost people don\u2019t talk about how all of them are necessary to do continual\nimprovement.\n\nBy combining these ideas, Deming ensured that we could improve whatever we\ncared about. And of course initially he taught this only to the people who\nwere willing to listen: the factory workers, industrial engineers and\ncorporate brass of bombed-out industrial Japan, in 1950, when he started\ngiving his first lectures there. The Japanese industrialists listened, and\nthen they went back to tinker with their production lines. Two decades of\nsingle subject studies \u2014 ahem, trial and error \u2014 later the folks at Toyota\nemerged with the Toyota Production System, and folks at Honda emerged with\ntheir Honda production system, and Mazda theirs, and on and on, until the\nworld of manufacturing was forever changed.\n\nWell, you have the ideas now. We may have forgotten them outside of\nmanufacturing, but I\u2019ve just given them to you. You can improve whatever you\nset your mind to.\n\nWhat will you change?\n\nOriginally published 15 April 2024, last updated 16 April 2024.\n\nThis article is part of the Operations topic cluster, which belongs to the\nBusiness Expertise Triad.
