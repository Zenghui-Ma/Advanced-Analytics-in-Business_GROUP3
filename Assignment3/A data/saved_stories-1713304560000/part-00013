It can sync, backup, and archive your data, offline and\nonline. Checksums and encryption keep your data safe and secure. Bring the\npower and distributed nature of git to bear on your large files with git-\nannex.\n\ngit-annex is designed for git users who love the command line. For everyone\nelse, the git-annex assistant turns git-annex into an easy to use folder\nsynchroniser.\n\nTo get a feel for git-annex, see the walkthrough.\n\n### key concepts\n\n  * git-annex man page\n  * how it works\n  * special remotes\n  * workflows\n  * sync\n\n|\n\n### the details\n\n  * encryption\n  * key-value backends\n  * bare repositories\n  * submodules\n  * internals\n  * scalability\n  * design\n\n|\n\n### other stuff\n\n  * testimonials\n  * privacy\n  * what git annex is not\n  * related software\n  * public git-annex repos\n  * thanks\n  * sitemap\n\n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n### use case: The Archivist\n\nBob has many drives to archive his data, most of them kept offline, in a safe\nplace.With git-annex, Bob has a single directory tree that includes all his\nfiles, even if their content is being stored offline. He can reorganize his\nfiles using that tree, committing new versions to git, without worry about\naccidentally deleting anything.When Bob needs access to some files, git-annex\ncan tell him which drive(s) they're on, and easily make them available.\nIndeed, every drive knows what is on every other drive. more about location\ntrackingBob thinks long-term, and so he appreciates that git-annex uses a\nsimple repository format. He knows his files will be accessible in the future\neven if the world has forgotten about git-annex and git. more about future-\nproofingRun in a cron job, git-annex adds new files to archival drives at\nnight. It also helps Bob keep track of intentional and unintentional copies of\nfiles, and logs information he can use to decide when it's time to duplicate\nthe content of old drives. more about backup copies|\n\n### use case: The Nomad\n\nAlice is always on the move, often with her trusty netbook and a small\nhandheld terabyte USB drive, or a smaller USB keydrive. She has a server out\nthere on the net. She stores data, encrypted in the Cloud.All these things can\nhave different files on them, but Alice no longer has to deal with the tedious\nprocess of keeping them manually in sync, or remembering where she put a file.\ngit-annex manages all these data sources as if they were git remotes. more\nabout special remotesWhen she has 1 bar on her cell, Alice queues up\ninteresting files on her server for later. At a coffee shop, she has git-annex\ndownload them to her USB drive. High in the sky or in a remote cabin, she\ncatches up on podcasts, videos, and games, first letting git-annex copy them\nfrom her USB drive to the netbook (this saves battery power). more about\ntransferring dataWhen she's done, she tells git-annex which to keep and which\nto remove. They're all removed from her netbook to save space, and Alice knows\nthat next time she syncs up to the net, her changes will be synced back to her\nserver. more about distributed version control  \n---|---  \n  \nIf that describes you, or if you're some from column A and some from column B,\nthen git-annex may be the tool you've been looking for to expand from keeping\nall your small important files in git, to managing your large files with git.\n\n### Recent news\n\ngit-annex shirts now available at hellotux.com Posted 22 days and 9 hours\nagoversion 10.20240227 Posted 1 month and 18 days ago\n\n### devblog\n\nday 651 a major release and a conference Posted 9 months and 25 days agoday\n649-650 speeding up repeated imports Posted 10 months and 19 days agoday\n644-648 terminal escape sequences Posted 1 year agoday 643 adjusted view\nbranches Posted 1 year and 1 month agoday 642 cost model Posted 2 years and 5\nmonths ago|\n\n### Recent videos\n\ngit-annex presentation by Yann B\u00fcchau at T\u00fcbix2023 Posted 9 months and 20 days\nagogit-annex assistant lan Posted 9 years and 10 months ago\n\n### Recent forum posts\n\nHow to allow clones to get files via URL?
