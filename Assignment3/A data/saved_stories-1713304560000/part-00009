I've played World of Warcraft, I've read\nDaniel Suarez' Daemon and Freedom\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, I've seen swarms of grown men running\naround town playing Pokemon Go; I'm sure these have informed my desires.\n\nAs far as I can tell, everyone in the VR space is working on how to overlay\ngraphics on the real world. But I haven't seen much on how to make a sword\nfeel like a sword instead of something made out of a balloon.\n\nFor sure there will be other applications once this is solved, but swinging a\nsword in VR is the one I care about.\n\n## Self Balancing Cube\n\nThere are many projects you can find online for self-balancing cubes. The one\nthat brought the space to my attention was made by Willem Pennings. I had\nnever thought about using reaction control wheels in this way, but it's a\nreally cool application. As Willem talks about in his post, they are often\nused for orienting satellites in space. What an appropriate analogue for\nforce-feedback on VR controllers--generating forces on an unteathered object.\n\nReaction wheels will only be able to provide three degrees of force-feedback,\nthe rotational degrees. It wont do anything if you're in VR trying to stab\nsomething solid (translation) instead of slicing something (rotation). Even if\nyou're slicing, it won't be able to provide too much torque And this is a good\nthing, we don't want a code bug to cause broken wrists! You can see how this\ncould eventually start to look like turning off the safety protocols on the\nholodeck.... But you'll be able to create a sense of momentum and drag on a VR\nsword, along with a physical force on the controller when someone or something\nelse strikes your sword.\n\n## Community\n\nI want this to exist but I don't want to build it or profit from it. To\nfacilitate those ends, I've put up a simple forum for anyone interested to\nconnect and share ideas. Good luck!!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
