However, this\ndomain name is also blocked on the territory of Belarus.\n\nAccording to Fiodar Pauluchenka, editor-in-chief at Reform.by, the site will\nmove to Reform.News URL as soon as the current domain is seized by the\nauthorities.\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing technical difficulties. Google and other search engines\nevaluate sites based on their history, backlinks, and authority.\n\nThe Executive Analytical Center\u2019s (EAC) decision was a setback for us. We will\nhave to start almost everything from scratch. However, it is not a tragedy.\nThe site is already blocked in Belarus, and the domain has been pessimized.\u201d\n\nFiodar Pauluchenka. Courtesy photo\n\n\u201cWe will continue our work and actively promote our new domain on social media\nto encourage our target audience to bookmark it. The Belarusian authorities\u2019\nintentions for the seized domains are unclear. I believe that propaganda\nmaterials or provocations may be posted there in the future.\u201d\n\nFiodar Pauluchenka thinks that changing the domain name will not have a\nsignificant impact on the core audience. However, it may cause some\ninconvenience for those who only consume content occasionally.\n\n\u201cUsers who arrive at our site through search engines or social networks may\nencounter issues. We acknowledge that the EAC\u2019s order will reduce our\npotential audience. However, we remain optimistic as we have persevered\nthrough challenging conditions until now.\u201d\n\nThe domain name Reform.news has already been blocked in Belarus. Fiodar\nPauluchenka sees no point in creating new mirror sites.\n\n\u201cJumping from one mirror site to another is not the solution to the problem.\nThere are simple and effective ways to bypass blocking. You can use a VPN,\ntemporary URLs, or AMP URLs (Google offers the technology that is much more\ndifficult to block). Belarusian consumers need to improve their technological\nlevel. This is the only solution to the problem.\u201d\n\nFiodar Pauluchenka argues that the order of the EAC contradicts the global\nrules of the Internet. These rules are established by international\ncorporations. It is therefore recommended to contact ICANN and propose\nrevoking EAC\u2019s status as the national administrator of the .by domain\nextension. \u201cThe work takes time, so it needs to start immediately,\u201c says the\neditor-in-chief.\n\nThe authorities seized BAJ\u2019s domain name and email address\n\nEuroradio: \u201cNone of our domains depends on the Belarusian registrar\u201d\n\nAccording to Pavel Sviardlou, editor-in-chief of Euroradio, the EAC order does\nnot cause any additional issues for the resource:\n\n\u201cThe new order does not pose any problems for Euroradio. We had initially\nconsidered how to ensure the resilience of our media. We no longer use\nCyrillic domains with the .\u0431\u0435\u043b extension, which we had registered as a\nprecaution. Currently, no Euroradio domains are registered with the Belarusian\nregistrar.\u201d\n\nPavel Sviardlou. Photo: kyky.org\n\n> \u201cWe publish on the main and backup domains: euroradio.fm and euroradio.by.\n> These domains are registered outside Belarus. We have long understood the\n> repressive nature of how Lukashenka\u2019s officials are trying to \u2018regulate\u2019 the\n> Internet.\u201d\n\nMr. Sviardlou is sure that nothing can happen to these domain names:\n\n\u201cTo take away our domains, the EAC needs to contact ICANN, a non-profit\norganization that manages domain names and IP addresses. But we hope that they\nare aware that the Belarusian authorities use the word \u2018extremism\u2019\nincorrectly. Labeling independent media as \u2018extremist materials\u2019 is a\nconvenient way for them to censor the media market and suppress political\nopponents.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotal control over the internet in Belarus is impossible as long as it\nremains turned on\u201d\n\nPauluk Bykouski, a senior analyst at MediaIQ, says that the authorities have\nnot come up with new ways to \u201cinfluence and control the media space.\u201d However,\nthe expert also sees several \u201ckey changes\u201d in the EAC order.\n\n\u201cDomains can now be classified as \u2018extremist materials\u2019 not only based on\ntheir content but also for \u2018national security protection purposes.\u2019 The courts\nhave interpreted \u2018extremist content\u2019 broadly, even without a specific order.\nThis practice of broad interpretation can now occur on a large scale.\u201d\n\nPauluk Bykouski\n\nDomain name registration and management have always been taken seriously.\nHowever, the EAC\u2019s order now includes additional \u201cshades or facets that did\nnot exist before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have friends who have purchased domain names. They were not interested in\npolitics. However, they sometimes acquired domain names belonging to\nindividuals labeled as \u2018extremists\u2019 or \u2018terrorists\u2019. At an auction, they\npurchased a beautiful domain name. The previous owners could not be located in\nthe public domain, as the resources were no longer available. I don\u2019t know\nwhat will happen to the domain names that were sold and bought now. It seems\nthat these domain names will simply be unavailable, canceled,\u201c says Mr.\nBykouski.\n\nThe EAC order will primarily encourage independent media and bloggers to move\nto Western domains and platforms. On one hand, monetizing content will become\nmore difficult, but the threat of \u201cexpropriation\u201d disappears.\n\n\u201cThe Belarusian authorities have tied all content publishers to the Belarusian\ninformation space through Decree No. 60 and other regulatory acts. You want to\nearn money from advertising in Belarus? You must establish a Belarusian\ncompany, you must have a domain extension .by, and you must have a Belarusian\nhosting service. Those who earned money from advertising in Belarus will now\nlose access to this sector. They will either turn to grant financing or look\nfor contextual or less profitable advertising. But no one wants to go idle and\ndie.\u201d\n\nWhat happens in the end?\n\n\u201cIf the authorities wish to increase their supervision of content for\nBelarusian internet users, they will now lose their previous level of control.\nMoving the publishers of these resources to other domain zones will free them\nfrom the need to self-censor. The Main Directorate of Combating Organized\nCrime and Corruption will not be able to scare them. Although they will no\nlonger have Belarusian advertising, they can still produce content. This is a\ndouble-edged sword: cleaning up the Belarusian media space is a logical move\nfor the authorities. However, many independent publications in exile had to\ncreate domain names with other extensions, such as .media, .info, .com, and so\non.\u201d\n\nThe EAC order will not cause significant disruptions. However, there are still\nsome nuances to consider. Previous amendments to the Criminal Code have\nresulted in the automatic transfer of the label \u201cextremist content\u201d to any\nmirror site.\n\n\u201cNo additional court decision is required for this. The race to block \u2018wrong\u2019\ndomains will now begin to determine the winner. Content creators will\nestablish mirror sites that can be cranked out endlessly. They will also\ncreate mirrors that are difficult to block in Belarus, using existing\ntechnologies. Let\u2019s see who will be the winner in this competition,\u201c the\nexpert says. \u201cFor the audience, this order will bring additional restrictions\non access to alternative information. But anyone who wants to find such\ninformation will find it. The authorities cannot establish full control as\nlong as the internet is not shut down in Belarus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe authorities are streamlining repression by removing legal obstacles\u201d\n\nAleh Aheyeu, Deputy Chairman of the Belarusian Association of Journalists,\nbelieves that most independent media outlets have already moved away from\nusing the .by domain extension.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this innovation poses a threat to media still using the .by domain\nextension and may be labeled as extremist content soon. They may soon lose the\nability to administer websites. The Executive Analytical Center will likely\ntake them over.\u201d\n\nAleh Aheyeu Photo: BAJ\n\nWhat will happen to the seized domain names? There is discussion in the media\ncommunity that instead of well-known socio-political resources, Russian-world\nand provocative websites may appear at their previous domain names. The lawyer\nagrees that such a threat does exist.\n\n\u201cAssessing its potential is challenging since creating media, filling it with\ncontent, and acquiring the necessary organizational resources and funding all\nrequire good management. If you have the resources and the desire to use a\nwell-known domain name for Russian propaganda, this will certainly happen,\u201d\nsays Mr. Aheyeu. \u201cThe EAC obviously wants to trade these domain names and\nauction them off.\u201d\n\nIs it possible to deprive the EAC of the right of a national administrator to\nmanage the .by domain extension database?\n\n\u201cMany people would like that to happen, but there is no possibility. ICANN\nsimply does not have such functionality. ICANN cannot strip anyone of the\nstatus of a national domain extension regulator, as it does not have such\nauthority.\u201d\n\nSo the only thing left for independent media in the current situation is to\npermanently emigrate from the .by domain extension?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like investment. The Belarusian authorities continue to demonstrate\ntheir inadequacy and lawlessness. All activities in which the Belarusian state\ncan interfere are risky. You need to understand that everything related to the\ndomain extension .by is fully controlled, regulated, and arbitrary. To expose\noneself to such risks or do anything else under the control of the authorities\nin such inadequate conditions is extremely unwise.\u201d\n\nFor a considerable amount of time, the Belarusian authorities have acted with\nimpunity, disregarding any legal framework. The authorities took a\nconsiderable amount of time to gradually take control of the websites.\n\n> \u201cUsing the example of the BAJ website, I can say that the entire process,\n> from setting unrealistic requirements to taking control of the site, took\n> three months. We appealed, we argued, and we justified our position \u2014 but\n> the opponent chose to spend a lot of resources to take control of one\n> website. Then they decided to take over dozens of sites in one go. To\n> achieve this, authorities are removing legal obstacles that prevent sites\n> from being taken over en masse, rather than individually.\u201d\n\nThis is another instance of increasing repression. Regrettably, it is not the\nfirst one, and it is likely not the last. When examining administrative and\ncriminal law, the primary focus of legal changes is to streamline repression\nfor the government.\n\nShare the news in social networks\n\nThe most important news and materials in our Telegram channel \u2014 subscribe!\n\n@bajmedia\n\nMore articles\n\n### The most reassuring thing is getting feedback from the audience\u201d.\nBelarusian independent media\u2019s take on the year\u2019s results and their plans for\nthe future\n\n28.12.2023\n\n### Reform.by media is on the brink of closure\n\n22.12.2023\n\n### \u201cEverything his camera captured turned into a masterpiece.\u201d Renowned\nphotographer Anatol Kliashchuk passes away\n\n05.09.2023\n\n### \u201cIf one of us is imprisoned, the other one takes the child and leaves the\ncountry.\u201d The key from the report of human rights activists on the\npsychological state of political emigrants\n\n13.06.2023\n\nAccents\n\nAll posts\n\n### 27 sharp splinters to remind the war is not over.
