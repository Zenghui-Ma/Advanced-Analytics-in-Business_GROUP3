Remarkably, newbie lifters can make gains with as little as\none set of six to 15 reps per week\u2014on average, at least. But average results\ndon\u2019t tell the full story. Some people will gain more than average; others\nwill gain less. If you\u2019re a typical endurance-focused Sweat Science reader,\nthere\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re in the second category. What does it take to put\non muscle for those who don\u2019t respond to the minimum?\n\nA new study in the Journal of Applied Physiology, from researchers at the\nUniversity of Sao Paulo and other institutions in Brazil as well as the\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham, fills in some details about this\nquestion. By assigning volunteers to do different lifting routines with each\nleg, they eliminate a bunch of the individual variations that usually cloud\nthe results of strength training studies. The results offer hope for those who\nmight initially be classed as \u201cnon-responders\u201d to resistance training, and\nsuggest that the best way to turn on muscle-building adaptations is\nstraightforward: add more sets.\n\n#### Similar Reads\n\nWhat exercise will work my chest muscles without stressing my shoulders?\n\nThis New Research Can Help You Decide How Much to Lift\n\nHow Women Respond to Strength Training, According to Science\n\nThe Data Behind a Once-a-Week Strength Routine\n\nTo start, it\u2019s worth unpacking this idea of \u201cnon-responders.\u201d Starting in the\n1980s and 1990s, a series of studies explored the role of genetics in exercise\nresponse. Give a bunch of people the same training program, and their genes\nwill explain about half of the variance in how much their fitness improves,\nthe studies found. Some people, it turned out, didn\u2019t seem to get fitter at\nall, even after several months of training. This idea of exercise non-\nresponders got a lot of enthusiastic attention (\u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m not as fit\nas I want to be!\u201d)\u2014and some pushback. Later studies tended to show that if you\ntook the non-responders from a study and had them train harder or at higher\nvolumes, they would indeed get fitter.\n\nThe studies above focused on aerobic exercise, but you\u2019d expect similar\nresults with resistance training. The new study, which was led by Hamilton\nRoschel of the University of Sao Paulo, was designed to see whether adding\nextra sets would turn non-responders into responders. They recruited 85\nvolunteers (41 men, 44 women), all over the age of 60 and not currently doing\nany strength training; older adults are generally less responsive to the\nanabolic stimulus of strength training, making non-response more likely. The\nexercise program involved two workouts per week for ten weeks, consisting of\nsets of between 8 and 15 reps of single-leg knee extensions with the weight\nchosen to reach failure in each set. Each volunteer did one set per workout\nwith one leg, and four sets per workout with the other leg.\n\nMuscle size was measured by MRI, and as expected, the one-set routine produced\nplenty of non-responders. Sixty percent of the subjects failed to gain more\nthan 3.3 percent in the cross-section of their quadriceps (a minimum threshold\nfor statistically significant improvement based on the repeatability of the\nMRI measurement). With four sets, the proportion of non-responders dropped to\n19 percent, and those who responded to one set had bigger responses to four\nsets. The conclusion: doing more sets leads to greater muscle gain, even among\nthose who don\u2019t seem to gain initially.\n\nThis may seem painfully obvious, but the same isn\u2019t true for strength as\nmeasured by one-rep max. Doing four sets didn\u2019t produce notably bigger\nstrength gains than one set, which seems both surprising and unfair. This\nresult is consistent with previous studies, though; in fact, I wrote about a\nstudy from Brad Schoenfeld\u2019s group back in 2018 that found exactly the same\nthing in young experienced lifters: five sets was better than three sets,\nwhich in turn was better than one set for muscle size; but all three options\nwere basically the same for bench press strength. Strength is a function of\nmuscle size and of the complex signaling process between brain and muscle. The\ntwo don\u2019t always go hand in hand.\n\nIn fact, there are more nuances in the individual (rather than average) data\nfrom Roschel\u2019s study. Among those who responded to one set, only 51 percent\ngot significantly bigger muscle-size results from four sets, and 15 percent\nactually did worse on four sets. Normally when I see results like that, I\u2019d\nassume that those 15 percent had some other life stress going on during the\nfour-set part of the study that tanked their results. But in this case, the\none-set and four-set parts of the study were taking place simultaneously in\ndifferent legs. That suggests that, while four sets are better than one for\nsome people, they really are worse for others.\n\nSo the superficial takeaway from this study is that you can get away with\nfairly minimal one-set training if your main goal is to get stronger, but\nyou\u2019ll probably benefit from more sets if\u2014like many aging athletes\u2014you\u2019re more\nconcerned with gaining or simply maintaining muscle mass. That echoes the\nearlier results from Schoenfeld and others. The deeper and more interesting\ntakeaway, though, is that this rule isn\u2019t true for everyone. The resulting\nuncertainty is inconvenient and a bit annoying, but it means we have to fall\nback on a simpler rule: if what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working, even if it follows\nthe latest research, try changing it.\n\nFor more Sweat Science, join me on Threads and Facebook, sign up for the email\nnewsletter, and check out my book Endure: Mind, Body, and the Curiously\nElastic Limits of Human Performance.\n\nFiled to:\n\n  * Science\n  * Strength and Power Training\n\nLead Photo: Ana Luz Crespi/Stocksy\n\n### Popular on Outside Online\n\n## Join Outside+\n\nEnjoy coverage of racing, history, food, culture, travel, and tech with access\nto unlimited digital content from Outside Network's iconic brands.\n\nLearn More\n\n### Healthy Living\n\n  * Clean Eating\n  * Oxygen\n  * Vegetarian Times\n  * Yoga Journal\n\n### Outdoor\n\n  * Backpacker\n  * Climbing\n  * Fly Fishing Film Tour\n  * Gaia GPS\n  * National Park Trips\n  * Outside\n  * Outside TV\n  * SKI\n  * Warren Miller\n\n### Endurance\n\n  * Beta MTB\n  * Fastest Known Time\n  * Pinkbike\n  * Trailforks\n  * Trail Runner\n  * Triathlete\n  * Velo\n  * Women's Running\n\n### Industry\n\n  * athleteReg\n  * Bicycle Retailer & Industry News\n  * FinisherPix\n  * Nastar\n  * Outside Events Cycling Series\n  * Outside Shop\n\n\u00a9 2024 Outside Interactive, Inc\n\n", "frontpage": true}
