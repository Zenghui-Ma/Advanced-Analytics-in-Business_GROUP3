Think of it like a bubble level, but with two (or more)\nseparate levels \"talking\" to one another.\n\nThe good news is that the app is already available for iOS, and can be found\non the App Store. This crowdfunding campaign was created to make it work on\nAndroid devices, and develop the app further for both platforms.\n\nMultilevel was created by a professional software engineer with over 20 years\nof experience. The idea was sparked by his boat getting damaged in a category\n5 hurricane in 2022.\n\n### What We Need & What You Get\n\n  * Money. Lots of money. To purchase a couple of different Android devices and develop the Android version of this app.\n  * The original iOS app was developed on a 2015 MacBook Air, and it won't be suitable for deploying apps to the App Store in a couple of weeks, ergo need to purchase some new Apple hardware to continue working on the iOS version.\n  * The Android app is planned to be free for everyone, as a 1:1 clone of the iOS app; the whole world will get something good, all thanks to you and me (and that hurricane).\n  * The iOS app will become even better, based on feedback from users and many hours of refining its interface and functionality.\n\n### The Impact\n\nIf all goes well, this app will make the world a little bit more parallel and\nsymmetrical. It could give good second life to old smartphones and tablets\n(especially ones with cracked screens).\n\n### Risks & Challenges\n\nThere aren't many risks associated with this fundraising campaign as the tool\nalready exists. It works on iOS, and does what it's intended to do. Is it\nperfect? No. But it's good enough. Depending on the amount of attention, it\nwill either be developed further, getting accompanied by the Android version,\nor if not enough demand is met, simply left at the point it is today,\nreceiving small updates every couple of months.\n\n### Other Ways You Can Help\n\nIf you know anyone who you believe could find a use for this instrument\n(carpenters, hobbyists, boat builders, etc), could you please make them aware\nof its existence? There may be people looking for a tool like that, and not\nknowing that it can be accomplished using an app and two smartphones.\n\nLooking for more information?
