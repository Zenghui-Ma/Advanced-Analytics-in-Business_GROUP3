Germans Finally Warm to Digital Payments\n\nThe Germans have long been known for their love of notes and coins.\nBusinesses, however, are slowly moving away from cash. Younger people prefer\nto pay by app, and the European Central Bank is also contemplating a digital\neuro.\n\nBy Michael Br\u00e4cher, David B\u00f6cking, Torsten Kleinz, Marlon Kr\u00fcger und Leonie\nUrbanczyk\n\n02.04.2024, 14.54 Uhr\n\n  * X.com\n  * Facebook\n  * E-Mail\n  * Messenger\n  * WhatsApp\n\n  * E-Mail\n  * Messenger\n  * WhatsApp\n\nIt\u2019s a Thursday on the German island of R\u00fcgen, a popular tourist destination\non the northeastern coast. The location: an everyday supermarket. On the\ncheckout conveyor belt: bread for toast, two croissants from the bakery and a\nsmall lemon tree. How to pay? In cash, of course.\n\nOutside in the parking lot, Sabine Schulz, 63, pushes the shopping cart to her\ncar. \"Cash is king,\" she says. With bills and coins, she always knows what she\nhas at her disposal. Paying by card? \"Too stressful,\" says Schulz, who says\nshe\u2019s in a rush and has to go.\n\nDER SPIEGEL 14/2024\n\nThe article you are reading originally appeared in German in issue 14/2024\n(March 28th, 2024) of DER SPIEGEL.\n\nSPIEGEL International\n\nR\u00fcgen is considered a stronghold for paper money in Germany, which is already\nwidely known as a cash-obsessed nation. Tourists are often amazed by how\nattached the islanders are to coins and bills. \"If you're going to R\u00fcgen, take\ncash and lots of bread with you!\u201d the Berliner Zeitung in Berlin once wrote.\n\nBut cards are also slowly finding their way to R\u00fcgen, albeit slowly. Stickers\ncan now be found on the windows and doors of many stores in the tourist town\nof Binz: \"We accept debit card payments.\" Many restaurants here also accept\ncredit cards now. But that's only \"because of the tourists,\" says a\nrestaurateur who doesn't want to be quoted by name, as if this were a\nsensitive subject. Though it is clear that the issue is complicated. In a\nsurvey conducted by the European Central Bank, 69 percent of Germans said that\ncash is either important or very important to them, especially older people\nand people with low incomes and education levels. In Europe, only Austrians\nappear to have a greater affinity for cash than the Germans.\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde\n\nFoto: Martin Schoeller / DER SPIEGEL\n\nBut that love is being put to the test. Millions of customers suddenly went\ncashless during the pandemic \u2013 and stuck with it. Many young people prefer to\npay even small amounts by debit card or mobile phone. The EU is pushing for\nlimits on cash payments, local authorities are issuing debit cards to asylum-\nseekers and the European Central Bank (ECB) is already working to create a\n\"digital euro.\" Cash, it seems, is coming under pressure from many different\nsides.\n\nMany are just accepting it with a shrug of the shoulders. But others view it\nas the beginning of the end of their financial freedom. Conspiracy theorists\nsee dark forces at work that want to peer into people\u2019s wallets. But even the\nlevel-headed are asking themselves if they really want the bank or the\ngovernment to be able to track their every expenditure. Whether a little\nsecrecy when spending money isn\u2019t also a civil right.\n\nThe right-wing extremist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is using the\nissue to gain votes and is fighting louder than other political parties for\nthe retention of banknotes and coins. \"The other parties have left the issue\nto the AfD for far too long,\" laments one banker from Frankfurt, who asks not\nto be quoted by name.\n\nAfD politician Max Otte during a press conference in Berlin in January 2022:\nHis party has been stoking fears about the disappearance of cash.\n\nFoto: Filip Singer / EPA\n\nThe AfD \u2013 the very party that was founded in opposition to the euro \u2013 has just\ncalled for a law to be passed stipulating that cash must be accepted in every\nstore. The right-wingers are essentially following in Austria's footsteps.\nThere, the right-wing populist Freedom Parts of Austria (FP\u00d6) wants to write\ncash into the constitution.\n\nInfluencers like non-fiction writer Marc Friedrich speak of a \"war on cash\"\nand argue that the abolition of paper currency is \"being vigorously pursued on\nall fronts.\" Max Otte, the former AfD candidate to become Germany\u2019s federal\npresident, and the former Degussa CEO Markus Krall, who had close contacts\nwith the conspiracy theorist Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, who has since been\nindicted as a suspected right-wing terrorist, also regularly stoke fears of\nthe abolition of cash.\n\n### The Beginning of the End\n\nIt\u2019s a winter\u2019s day in Bergedorf in the east of Hamburg. An elderly gentleman\nboards a bus on the X30 line. When the man tries to pull some coins out of his\nwallet, the bus driver shakes his head. \"Payment with card only,\" he says. A\nback and forth ensues with a predictable end. The bus drives off and the\ncustomer is left standing in Hamburg\u2019s winter weather.\n\nSince January, Hamburg\u2019s public transportation provider HVV has been fully\ncommitted to digital payments on its buses. Passengers can still insert coins\nat the ticket machines, but onboard HVV buses, tickets are only available with\na prepaid card that has to be topped up beforehand. No exceptions allowed.\n\nBus drivers no longer sell tickets on the buses in Hamburg, and customers must\nuse a card to pay.\n\nFoto: Marcus Brandt / dpa\n\nThings got off to a bumpy start: HVV quickly ran out of the smart cards and\nmany elderly residents felt excluded. Most passengers, though, didn\u2019t even\nnotice the shift since only a small minority still purchased their tickets\nwith cash. The transport authority says there was little criticism, though\nsome had initial questions about how it worked. Hamburg isn\u2019t the only city\nthat wants to spare its bus drivers the trouble of having to count change. The\ncities of Chemnitz and Mainz have also abolished cash payments on buses.\n\nEven those roaming the restaurant scene in Berlin, Cologne or Munich don't\nalways get too far with cash. Increasingly, guests are greeted by a sign at\nthe entrance to establishments: \"No Cash.\"\n\nAs is the case at Julia Strasser\u2019s Barista Sistar caf\u00e9 in Munich. \"It was a\nconscious business decision,\" says the owner. She bought the caf\u00e9 two years\nago and switched from \"cash only\" to \"card or PayPal only.\" Initially, there\nwere negative reviews on Google, says Strasser, and many potential guests left\nthe caf\u00e9 in frustration. But for Strasser, the advantages outweigh the\ndisadvantages. She says that cashless payments are easier to process, sales\nare transparent and the business doesn\u2019t have to fear robberies or theft by\nemployees. It\u2019s faster, too. \"No one has ever been able to give me a rational\nexplanation for why they only pay with cash,\" she says.\n\nIn a recent survey, the Cologne-based EHI Retail Institute found that 35\npercent of companies in the retail sector want to push back cash in favor of\n\"non-cash means of payment.\" Four percent said they were working on banning\ncash from their stores altogether. Still, 20 percent see so much future in\nbills and coins that they want to make handling them more efficient.\n\nAn increasing number of stores are using machines that count, deposit and\ndispense change. Employees no longer have to take the cash in their hands.\nThis is more hygienic and can also help prevent employee theft. What\u2019s more,\nthe cash flows are transparent, which also pleases the tax authorities.\n\nLaw enforcement officers and tax investigators have been lobbying for maximum\ncash limits for years. For them, large amounts of cash are an indication of\nsuspicious transactions more than anything. \"We often come across lockers full\nof cash,\" says Oliver Huth, the state chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia of\nthe Association of German Criminal Investigators. \"The cash comes from every\ncrime you can imagine: drug offenses, extortion and money laundering.\" In some\ncases, the criminals have to change their money into 500 euro bills because\nthey would otherwise run out of storage space.\n\nIf the money has to be taken from the safe deposit box to be laundered abroad,\nsays Huth, organized crime has a number of pathways to choose from. The\nperpetrators can use it to buy expensive watches or cars and transport the\ngoods across the border, for example. In such cases, investigators have\nvirtually no chance of tracing the money flows. Huth has long campaigned for a\ncash limit of 10,000 euros, as envisioned in the new EU money laundering\nrules. \"I see no reason why legal transactions over a certain amount should\nnot be concluded with bank money,\" he says.\n\nFlorian K\u00f6bler, the national head of the German tax union DSTG, calls the\nplanned cash limit a \"game changer\" for investigators. Under the rules,\ncriminals would be required to prove that the money comes from legal sources\nwhen buying things like luxury goods. K\u00f6bler himself is advocating for an\nupper limit of just 1,000 euros. He says the younger generation tends to use\nelectronic payment methods anyway. It sounds drastic. On the other hand: Italy\nalready has an upper limit of 5,000 euros for cash payments in place.\n\nEconomist Kenneth Rogoff: \"The curse of cash.\"\n\nFoto: Jason Alden / Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nIn view of the risk of corruption and tax evasion, economist Kenneth Rogoff\nwrote \"The Curse of Cash\" back in 2016 \u2013 a book which proposed a four-point\nplan to abolish it, using the United States as an example. The large banknotes\nwould disappear first, followed later by the small denominations. At the same\ntime, the state offers all citizens a digital equivalent, such as a bank\naccount or a payment card. New laws would protect privacy on the one hand, but\nwould prevent concealment on the other. In order to avoid payment defaults,\ntransactions would be processed in real-time. Science fiction? For asylum-\nseekers in Greiz in the eastern state of Thuringia, it has already become\nreality.\n\nThe district made headlines across Germany when it recently introduced a debit\ncard for asylum-seekers living there. Since last December, most of the money\ndistributed to them has been available via a personalized prepaid card with\nthe Mastercard logo. This gives the authorities there control \u2013 not only over\nwho receives the money, but also where it is spent. The card is also linked to\na postal code.\n\nAn asylum-seeker's debit card in Bavaria: The system gives the state more\ncontrol over how money is spent by refugees.\n\nFoto: Sven Hoppe / dpa\n\nFor asylum-seekers, this means that they can only use the card to make\npurchases within the district. \"This is a massive encroachment into the lives\nof refugees,\" says Ellen K\u00f6nneker of the Thuringian Refugee Council. She says\nit is often no longer possible for refugees to visit friends in other\ndistricts. The district, on the other hand, sees no discrimination, as the\ncard can ultimately be used in an 843-square-kilometer area. Other districts\nare following suit, and a nationwide regulation that gives the federal states\nplenty of leeway is in the works. Bavaria wants to restrict the sectors for\nwhich the debit card may be used \u2013 excluding things like online shopping,\ngambling or money transfers abroad.\n\nThe Initiative New Social Market Economy (INSM), an employers\u2019 lobby group,\nalso wants to force people in Germany receiving welfare benefits who could be\nworking to use a similar card. INSM Managing Director Thorsten Alsleben\ndemands: \"State benefits should only be provided through a debit card to\ncreate greater incentive to take up employment.\" Maximilian M\u00f6rseburg, a\nmember of the German federal parliament from Stuttgart, also views using debit\ncards for recipients of welfare payments as a way of preventing misuse of the\nsocial welfare system.\n\nBut why stop at welfare recipients? It doesn't take much imagination to\npicture a debit card for recipients of student aid and loans, for pension\nbenefits or for recipients of sick pay benefits. And are child benefits\nactually spent on children in the end?\n\n### The Defenders of Cash\n\nUrs Dietrich believes things are going too far. \"Cash is freedom,\" says the\n30-year-old cellist, who studies music at the Folkwang University of the Arts\nin the city of Essen and prefers to pay for his everyday expenses with cash as\na matter of principle. What bothers him is the very thing that apparently\ndelights criminologists and politicians: the possibility of surveillance. He\nsays it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business where he buys his gasoline.\n\nPaper money fan Urs Dietrich: \"Cash is freedom.\"\n\nFoto: Privat\n\nDietrich is concerned about more than just the potential loss of privacy \u2013 he\nalso worries about the loss of a bit of culture. \"When I get 200 euros for a\nperformance, then I know exactly what I've achieved,\" he says. Dietrich saved\nup the deposit for his wedding rings, bill by bill. \"It was special for me to\nactually hold the money in my hand.\"\n\nAndreas Spinkler manages the German business of Coinstar, a company the\noperates coin counting and conversion machines. Customers tip their collected\nchange into the company\u2019s vending machines and, after deducting a fee of just\nunder 10 percent, they receive shopping vouchers that they can redeem\nimmediately. The company\u2019s coin counting kiosks have been present in Germany\nsince 2016, and there are now more than 2,500 of them in the country,\nsignificantly more than in Italy or Spain, where Coinstar launched at the same\ntime.\n\n\"At some locations in Germany, I have placed three machines next to each other\n\u2013 in socially disadvantaged districts in Berlin or Hamburg, for example,\" says\nSpinkler. He adds that people in those areas sometimes receive part of their\nwages in cash. \"If you have to be careful with your spending, cash payments\nare easier to handle,\" says Spinkler. He says the Coinstar machines aren\u2019t as\npopular in expensive neighborhoods. \"Only poorer people have to empty their\ncoin jar sometimes.\"\n\nFrank Sch\u00e4ffler is also an avowed fan of cash. If you ask him about it, he\nimmediately pulls out his mobile phone case, which contains several bills. In\na speech before the German parliament, he referred to cash as \"an element of\nfreedom minted in coins.\"\n\nFrank Sch\u00e4ffler, a member of the German parliament with the FDP is an avid fan\nof cash and keeping it in circulation.\n\nFoto: Frank Sch\u00e4ffler\n\nThe politician, a member of the business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP),\nhas never held an important office in his party, but he has nonetheless\nachieved some prominence. During the euro crisis, Sch\u00e4ffler became the most\nvocal opponent of financial aid for countries such as Greece, Portugal and\nCyprus \u2013 whose bailouts his party supported in the end. \"That\u2019s when it became\nclear to me how easily the state can restrict access to bank deposits,\" he\nsays. At the peak of the crisis, Cypriot banks were temporarily closed and\nonly allowed small withdrawals from ATMs, but the German central bank, the\nBundesbank, still had to send the country billions in euro notes by secret\nflight. \"People could only withdraw 100 euros a day from ATM machines,\"\nrecalls Sch\u00e4ffler, who happened to be in Cyprus at the time.\n\nToday, the FDP member is one of the few politicians in the current federal\ngovernment coalition to speak out publicly in the debate over the future of\ncash. He also supported the ban on cash payments for property purchases that\nwas agreed to in the contract forming the coalition government. However, he\nrejects upper limits on cash transactions in other areas.\n\nFDP party leader and German Finance Minister Christian Lindner also considers\nthe limit on cash spending to be an \"unnecessary restriction of freedom,\"\nwhereas Interior Minister Nancy Faeser of the center-left Social Democratic\nParty (SPD) campaigned for the limit in view of the risk of money laundering.\nGermany abstained in the European Council vote on the corresponding\nlegislative package \u2013 but the EU regulation will still go into effect in\nGermany. It is expected that it will be approved this summer, but it could\ntake years before it is fully implemented, sources in Berlin say.\n\n### A Rapid Decline\n\nUltimately, dark forces might not even be needed to abolish cash. According to\nestimates, the average German still has around 100 euros in their wallet, but\nthe share of cash payments is declining rapidly. According to a recent survey\ntaken by Postbank, one in three Germans say they could come to terms with the\nabolition of bills and coins \u2013 in the 18-to-39 age group, the figure is 57\npercent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bundesbank has come to the conclusion that the acceptance of\ncash may no longer be guaranteed in the coming decade. The euro watchdogs had\nfuturists draw up three scenarios. In the first one, cash has practically\ndisappeared from people's everyday lives. As a result of the growing number of\nconsumers paying digitally, there are few bank branches and ATMs left in\nGermany. Even withdrawing money at the checkout counter at stores no longer\nworks because so few customers are paying with cash.\n\nBanknotes at the checkout: Is cash creeping out?\n\nFoto: Marijan Murat / dpa\n\nIn the second scenario, there are still some cash users, but there are so few\nthat more and more ATMs and bank branches are disappearing. According to the\nfuturists, in this scenario, the cash is \"creeping out.\"\n\n\u201cThe preservation of cash is not self-evident.\"\n\nBurkhard Balz, member of the board of the Bundesbank\n\nThere is only one scenario in which cash can really hold its own. In this\nscenario, politicians adopt countermeasures to ensure that the population\nrediscovers the advantages of cash. But is there anymore to that than wishful\nthinking? The scenarios are not forecasts, just possible developments, says\nBurkhard Balz, a member of the Bundesbank's board. \"Our future study shows\nthat the preservation of cash is not self-evident,\" he says. The Bundesbank\nhas the task of ensuring that cash continues to circulate effectively in\nGermany, says Balz. \"That's why we want to take countermeasures now, before\nit\u2019s possibly too late,\" he says. A National Cash Forum has been tasked with\npreparing initiatives to stabilize the circulation of cash.\n\nIn the German financial capital of Frankfurt, people are already working on\nthe cash of the future. The ECB is currently exploring the possible uses of a\ndigital euro with project tenders worth a total of several hundred million\neuros. The aim is to create a digital form of money with which users can pay\neasily and, if possible, anonymously \u2013 and this should also be free of charge\nfor private individuals. Many details still haven\u2019t been addressed. What is\nclear, though, is that the public will receive an additional account\nspecifically for the digital euro. The digital currency is intended to be\nEurope\u2019s answer to American payment service providers like Visa, Mastercard\nand PayPal and could be launched in 2027.\n\nEconomist Peter Bofinger: \"Let\u2019s be honest: Who likes drinking alcohol-free\nwine?\"\n\nFoto: Frank Rumpenhorst / picture alliance / dpa\n\nBut is there really a need for that?\n\nThere\u2019s actually no longer any reason to stick to cash payments, says economic\nresearcher Peter Bofinger. He argues that people who pay in cash do so out of\npersonal preference \u2013 or because they don\u2019t want to leave a trace.\n\nThe economist says digital \"cash\" is a bit like a \"alcohol-free wine\" in that\nit lacks the most important ingredient, the physical, the tangible. \"And let\u2019s\nbe honest: Who likes drinking alcohol-free wine?\"\n\n### Mehr lesen \u00fcber\n\nEuropean Central Bank Banking and Finance\n\nKostenlose Online-Spiele\n\nmehr Spiele\n\n  * Kreuzwortr\u00e4tsel\n  * Solit\u00e4r\n  * Sudoku\n  * Mahjong\n  * Bubble-Shooter\n  * Jackpot\n  * Snake\n  * Exchange\n  * 2048\n  * Doppel\n  * Rushtower\n  * Sudoken\n  * Street\n  * Wortblitz\n  * Fibonacci\n  * Gumblast\n  * Wimmelbild\n  * Skiracer\n  * Trivial Pursuit\n\nServiceangebote von SPIEGEL-Partnern\n\nGutscheine\n\nAnzeige\n\nLidl Gutscheine\n\nThalia Gutscheine\n\nTchibo Gutsheine\n\n14% Gutschein\n\nTop Gutscheine Alle Shops\n\n  * Bu\u00dfgeldrechner\n  * Firmenwagenrechner\n\n  * Brutto-Netto-Rechner\n  * Jobsuche\n  * Kurzarbeitergeld-Rechner\n  * Studienf\u00e4cher erkl\u00e4rt\n\n  * Gehaltsvergleich\n  * Versicherungen\n  * W\u00e4hrungsrechner\n  * Unternehmen\n\n  * B\u00fccher bestellen\n  * Eurojackpot\n  * Ferientermine\n\n  * Gl\u00fccksSpirale\n  * Gutscheine\n  * LOTTO 6aus49\n\n  * Seniorenportal\n  * Spiele\n  * Streaming Guide\n\n  * Das t\u00e4gliche Quiz\n\nAlle Magazine des SPIEGEL\n\n  * DER SPIEGEL\n  * SPIEGEL GESCHICHTE\n  * SPIEGEL COACHING\n  * SPIEGEL WISSEN\n  * Dein SPIEGEL\n  * SPIEGEL BESTSELLER\n  * SPIEGEL CHRONIK\n  * SPIEGEL SPEZIAL\n  * SPIEGEL START\n  * SPIEGEL GELD\n  * S-Magazin\n  * SPIEGEL EDITION\n\nSPIEGEL Gruppe\n\nAbo Abo k\u00fcndigen Shop manager magazin Harvard Business manager 11FREUNDE\nWerbung Jobs MANUFAKTUR SPIEGEL Akademie SPIEGEL Ed\n\nImpressum Datenschutz Nutzungsbedingungen Teilnahmebedingungen Cookies &\nTracking Newsletter Kontakt Hilfe Text- & Nutzungsrechte\n\nFacebook Instagram Wo Sie uns noch folgen k\u00f6nnen\n\nDie Wiedergabe wurde unterbrochen.\n\n0:00\n\n0:00\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde\n\nFoto: Martin Schoeller / DER SPIEGEL\n\nAfD politician Max Otte during a press conference in Berlin in January 2022:\nHis party has been stoking fears about the disappearance of cash.\n\nFoto: Filip Singer / EPA\n\nBus drivers no longer sell tickets on the buses in Hamburg, and customers must\nuse a card to pay.\n\nFoto: Marcus Brandt / dpa\n\nEconomist Kenneth Rogoff: \"The curse of cash.\"\n\nFoto: Jason Alden / Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nAn asylum-seeker's debit card in Bavaria: The system gives the state more\ncontrol over how money is spent by refugees.\n\nFoto: Sven Hoppe / dpa\n\nPaper money fan Urs Dietrich: \"Cash is freedom.\"\n\nFoto: Privat\n\nFrank Sch\u00e4ffler, a member of the German parliament with the FDP is an avid fan\nof cash and keeping it in circulation.\n\nFoto: Frank Sch\u00e4ffler\n\nBanknotes at the checkout: Is cash creeping out?\n\nFoto: Marijan Murat / dpa\n\nEconomist Peter Bofinger: \"Let\u2019s be honest: Who likes drinking alcohol-free\nwine?\"\n\nFoto: Frank Rumpenhorst / picture alliance / dpa\n\n", "frontpage": false}
