This study has on\noccasion been highly mathematical in nature while at other times it has more\nrelevance to other scientific disciplines. In this article we take a broad\nlook at the topic, although we will emphasis its more mathematical aspects.\n\nThe early Greek ideas on natural philosophy, and in particular on the nature\nof light, would influence the world for two thousand years. Empedocles, in the\nfifth century BC, postulated that everything was composed of four elements;\nfire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human eye out\nof the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from\nthe eye making sight possible. Now of course if this were true one could see\nat night, so Empedocles knew that things were somewhat more complicated than\nthis and postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a\nsource such as the sun.\n\nNot everyone believed that sight was explained by a beam coming from the eye.\nLucretius wrote in On the nature of the Universe (55 BC):-\n\n> The light and heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which,\n> when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the\n> interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.\n\nDespite this remarkably accurate view, Lucretius's views were not generally\naccepted and sight was still seen as emanating from the eye.\n\nLong before Lucretius, Euclid had made a mathematical study of light. He wrote\nOptica T in about 300 BC in which he studied the properties of light which he\npostulated travelled in straight lines. He described the laws of reflection\nand studied them mathematically. He did question sight being the result of a\nbeam from the eye, for he asks how if one closes ones eyes, then opens them at\nnight one sees the stars immediately. Of course if the beam from the eye\ntravels infinitely fast this is not a problem. In about 60 AD Heron made the\ninteresting observation that when light is reflected by a mirror it travels\nalong the path of least length. Ptolemy, about 80 years after Heron, studied\nlight in his astronomical work. Through accurate measurements of positions of\nstars, he realised that light is refracted by the atmosphere.\n\nThe biggest breakthrough in ancient times was made by al-Haytham around 1000\nAD. He argued that sight is due only to light entering the eye from an outside\nsource and there is no beam from the eye itself. He gave a number of arguments\nto support this claim, the most persuasive being the camera obscura, or\npinhole camera. Here light passes through a pinhole shining on a screen where\nan inverted image is observed. Anyone visiting Edinburgh in Scotland should go\nto see the camera obscura there near the top of the Royal Mile and marvel at\njust how effective the camera obscura is in this enjoyable tourist attraction.\n\nNow al-Haytham argued quite correctly that we see objects because the sun's\nrays of light, which he believed to be streams of tiny particles travelling in\nstraight lines, are reflected from objects into our eyes. He understood that\nlight must travel at a large but finite velocity, and that refraction is\ncaused by the velocity being different in different substances. He also\nstudied spherical and parabolic mirrors, and understood how refraction by a\nlens will allow images to be focused and magnification to take place. He\nunderstood mathematically why a spherical mirror produces aberration.\n\nEuropean scholars who followed al-Haytham did not know of his work. It was not\nwidely available in Europe until the final quarter of the 16th century.\nHowever, without making major advances on the Greeks, some Europeans did make\nsome improvements. Grosseteste, in about 1220, stressed the significance of\nthe properties of light to natural philosophy and in turn advocated using\ngeometry to study light. He put forward theories of colour, however, which\nhave little merit. Roger Bacon, about 50 years later, continued to follow his\nteacher Grosseteste in believing in the importance of the study of light and\nhe did come up with some correct conclusions deduced from experiments carried\nout in a very scientific way. He believed that the velocity of light is\nfinite, studied convex lenses and advocated their use to correct defective\neyesight. About the same time at Roger Bacon was working on optics in England,\nWitelo was studying mirrors and refraction of light and wrote up his findings\nin Perspectiva T which was a standard text on optics for several centuries.\n\nFollowing this there was improved understanding of using a lens, and by 1590\nZacharius Jensen even used compound lenses in a microscope. The first person\nto make a significant step forward after the time of al-Haytham, however, was\nKepler at the beginning of the 17th century. Kepler worked on optics, and came\nup with the first correct mathematical theory of the camera obscura. He also\ngave the first correct explanation of how the human eye works, with an upside-\ndown image formed on the retina. He correctly explained shortsight and\nlongsight. He gave the important result that the intensity of light observed\nfrom a source varies inversely with the square of the distance of the observer\nfrom the source. He was wrong, however, in arguing that the velocity of light\nis infinite. He published his results were published in Supplements to Witelo,\non the optical part of astronomy (1604). In fact an important discovery had\nbeen made earlier by Thomas Harriot when he discovered the sine law of\nrefraction of light in 1601, but he did not publish the result.\n\nKepler's work was a nice piece of mathematics, but people did not believe that\nthe eye created an upside-down image on the retina. The argument that we do\nnot observe the world upside-down seemed convincing. Only about five years\nafter the publication of Kepler's work, Galileo constructed a telescope,\nfollowing ideas of Hans Lippershey from the Netherlands who had constructed\none in the previous year. Galileo turned his telescope on Jupiter in 1610 and\nobserved its four major moons. Thomas Harriot in England observed the moons of\nJupiter in the same year. In 1611 Kepler published Dioptrice T which was\nanother important work on optics. It described how one could put lenses\ntogether to give what today is called a telephoto lens. It also described\ntotal internal reflection but failed to give the correct law of refraction of\nlight, Harriot's result being unknown to Kepler (or anyone else) although the\ntwo had corresponded.\n\nWillebrord Snell discovered the sine law of refraction of light in 1621 but,\nlike Harriot, he did not publish the result. The first to publish the law was\nDescartes in 1637. In was contained in La Dioptrique T published as a\nsupplement to Discours de la m\u00e9thod pour bien conduire sa raison et chercher\nla v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans les sciences T. Descartes and Fermat carried on a discussion\nafter this publication (see [47] for details) and Fermat initially assumed\nthat they had reached a different law since they had started from different\nassumptions. Fermat proposed that light follows the path which takes the\nshortest time, enabling Snell's law of refraction to be deduced\nmathematically. Other contributions around this time by Descartes was his\nbelief in the mathematical argument by Kepler which showed that the image\nformed on the retina of the eye should be upside-down. He conducted an\nexperiment with the eye of a dead ox, scraping away the retina and seeing that\nindeed the image was upside-down. Some of Descartes' claims were fallacious\nsuch as his belief that the velocity of light is infinite. He stated, rather\nfoolishly, that he staked his philosophy on that fact. See [38] for details of\nwhy Descartes was so strongly convinced.\n\nIn 1647 Cavalieri published an important contribution to optics when he gave\nthe relationship between the curvature of a thin lens and its focal length.\nInspired by Kepler's discoveries on light, James Gregory had begun to work on\nlenses and in Optica PromotaT (1663) he described the first practical\nreflecting telescope now called the Gregorian telescope. In fact Gregory made\na fundamental discovery about light a few years later while in St Andrews. He\ndiscovered diffraction by letting light pass through a feather but he was not\nthe first to investigate this phenomenon as Grimaldi had studied it a few\nyears earlier. Here is Gregory's description:-\n\n> Let in the sun's rays by a small hole to a darkened house, and at the hole\n> place a feather (the more delicate and white the better for this purpose),\n> and it shall direct to a white wall or paper opposite to it a number of\n> small circles and ovals (if I mistake them not) whereof one is somewhat\n> white (to wit, the middle which is opposite the sun) and all the rest\n> severally coloured. I would gladly hear Mr Newton's thoughts of it.\n\nThe reference to Newton brings us to the person who revolutionised thinking on\nlight. We now looking at the last third of the 17th century, a period where\nmajor theories on light would be put forward. These resulted from the\ncontributions of Huygens, Hooke and Newton and two opposing theories were\nsupported. In the 1660s Gassendi had put forward the particle theory,\nsuggesting that light was composed of a stream of tiny particles, while\nDescartes suggested that space was filled with 'plenum' which transmitted\npressure from a light source onto the eye. The wave theory by Huygens and\nHooke was a development of Descartes' ideas where now they proposed that light\nbe a wave through the plenum, while Newton supported the theory that light\nrays were composed of tiny particles. Let us first examine Newton's major\ncontribution.\n\nWhen Newton experimented with passing light through a triangular glass prism\nin around 1666 it was well known that a spectrum of colours was produced.\nThere was a standard explanation of this, namely that the pure white light was\nsomehow corrupted in passing through the glass. The further it had to travel\nin the glass the more it was corrupted, hence the different colours that\nemerged. Newton carried out a very simple experiment. He placed a second\ntriangular prism in the path of the coloured beams of light emerging from the\nfirst triangular prism, but he put the second prism the other way up that is\nstanding on its point. The coloured rays of light entered this second prism\nand a single ray of white light emerged.\n\nNow having passed through the two prisms the light had passed through a longer\ndistance of glass than if it had just passed through one, and it should have\nbeen further corrupted, but it was not. The true explanation was clear to\nNewton. The white light was not pure as believed, it was composed of light of\nthe different colours which combined to give white light. Now Newton used his\nunderstanding of colours to design telescopes which had as little chromatic\naberration as possible. He now understood what caused chromatic aberration,\nthe coloured fringes seen round objects viewed through a telescope. It was an\nalmost necessary consequence of using lenses. To avoid the problem Newton\ndesigned a reflecting telescope.\n\nIn 1672 Newton published his theory of colour in the Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society and in it he gave experimental evidence that\nlight is composed of minute particles. A few years earlier another member of\nthe Royal Society, Robert Hooke, had published a wave theory of light and his\nown theory of colours. He reacted to Newton's paper by claiming that what was\noriginal in the paper was wrong and what was correct in the paper was stolen\nfrom him. In [3] Nakajima discusses the Newton-Hooke controversy of 1672:-\n\n> It has not been sufficiently emphasized that there existed two kinds of\n> modification theory of colours, Aristotle's modification theory and the\n> Descartes-Hooke modification theory. This seems to have caused some\n> confusion in the interpretation of the optical controversy between Newton\n> and Hooke in 1672. [We] present a new interpretation of the optical\n> controversy of 1672.\n\nThe effect of the argument was to prevent Newton publishing his complete\ntheory of light until after the death of Hooke in 1703. We should point out,\nhowever, that Newton's views did undergo changes between 1672 and the\npublication of Opticks in 1704. These are examined carefully in [41].\n\nNow Hooke was not the only person to argue against Newton's theory of light.\nHuygens was developing his wave theory of light at this time and by 1678 he\nhad it worked out in all its mathematical details although he did not publish\nhis Treatise on light until 1690. Like Newton, an interest in telescopes had\nprompted Huygens to try to understand the nature of light. He proposed a wave\ntheory, but of course a wave has to travel through a medium so Huygens' model\nincluded an all pervading aether which carries the wave. This is similar to\nthe way that sound waves travel. Sound waves travel in air and if a bell is\nplaced in a vacuum then nothing is heard. Similarly, it was believed, light\nwaves needed the aether through which to travel. It was a beautifully worked\nout theory and explained most of the observed phenomena of light such as\nreflection, refraction, diffraction etc.\n\nAfter Hooke's death, Newton published Opticks in 1704. It discussed the theory\nof light and colour and dealt with investigations of the colours of thin\nsheets, 'Newton's rings', and the diffraction of light. To explain some of his\nobservations Newton had to argue that the corpuscles of light created waves in\nthe aether. However, the work strongly argued for a corpuscular theory of\nlight, with the most telling argument being that light travels in straight\nlines yet waves are seen to bend into a region of shadow. There was a possible\nway to distinguish between Newton's corpuscular theory and Huygens' wave\ntheory. In the former theory it was necessary for light to travel faster in a\nmore dense medium, while in the latter theory light needed to travel more\nslowly.\n\nIn fact the speed of light had been calculated by R\u00f8mer a couple of years\nbefore Huygens had completed working out of his wave theory. In 1676 R\u00f8mer\nused data from the eclipses of Jupiter's moons to get the first reasonable\nvalue for the speed of light. He realised that the reason the time between\neclipses of Jupiter's moons by the planet was shorter when the Earth on the\nsame side of the sun as Jupiter and became longer when Earth and Jupiter moved\ntowards opposite sides of the sun was due to the time taken for light to cross\nthe increased distance. He calculated the speed as 225,000 km per second,\nrather than the correct value of 299,792 km per second, but it was a\nremarkable achievement and a definite proof that the velocity of light is\nfinite. However distinguishing between the wave theory and the corpuscular\ntheory with experiments on the velocity were quite impossible at this time. It\nwould not be until 1850 that Foucault showed that light travelled more slowly\nin water than in air showing that Newton was wrong.\n\nDuring the 18th century most opinion sided with Newton. He had been right on\nso many things that it was generally assumed that he must be right about light\nbeing corpuscular. Not everyone in the 18th century agreed, however, and when\nEuler published his work on optics Nova theoria lucis et colorum T in 1746 it\nargued strongly for a wave theory of light. Diffraction was the hardest\nphenomenon to explain with a corpuscular theory, and Euler used it to support\nhis wave theory. He argued strongly for an analogy between light and sound and\nconsequently for the aether which carried light waves as air carries sound\nwaves. The sun, said Euler, is \"a bell ringing out light\". Euler's theory was\nin fact the second version of his wave theory of light and details of both\ntheories are considered in [24].\n\nLittle progress had been made between Newton's Opticks of 1704 and Euler's\noptical work. Perhaps the most significant was James Bradley's calculation of\nthe velocity of light in 1727. This was still an astronomical method, but\nBradley used observations of the aberration of light from stars. This is the\napparent slight change in the positions of stars caused by the yearly motion\nof the Earth. It is worth noting that Bradley's work provided first direct\nevidence that the Earth revolves around the sun.\n\nEuler's support of the wave theory did little to change the general belief in\nthe corpuscular theory. In [22] Hakfoort studies the work of Nicolas B\u00e9guelin\nof 1772:-\n\n> Beguelin compared the Newtonian emission theory of light and the wave theory\n> of Leonhard Euler. Whereas others opted for one of the two theories by\n> invoking arguments or authorities, Beguelin made a systematic search for\n> experiments which he hoped would settle the dispute. Two of these\n> experiments were most original. The first, which Beguelin himself performed,\n> concerned light rays grazing a glass surface. For several reasons it did not\n> have the impact it deserved. The second one was a thought experiment which\n> was meant to illustrate a major tenet of the wave theory, that is, the\n> analogy between light and sound. ... neither of them brought the debate to\n> an end.\n\nHowever Thomas Young produced a major piece of evidence in favour of the wave\ntheory when he carried out experiments on the interference of light between\n1797 and 1799 in Cambridge. Young placed a screen with two pin holes in it in\nfront of a point source of light. He published his results in 1801, describing\nthe pattern of dark and light bands seen on the screen behind the holes. He\nproduced these interference patterns also using two slits and he explained the\nresults using a wave theory. In fact he went further than this, explaining\nNewton's results in terms of his wave theory. The different colours of light,\nsaid Young, are different wavelengths of light. He related the amount of\nrefraction of light, or diffraction of light, to its wavelength. According to\nYoung, diffraction fringes occur as a result of interference between the\nincident wave and a wave arising from the edge of a diffracting aperture or\nbody. He even calculated the wavelengths of the different colours using\nNewton's own experimental data. His explanation of interference, from his own\nwords of 1807, is as follows [1]:-\n\n> The middle of the pattern is always light, and the bright stripes on each\n> side are at such distances that the light coming to them from one of the\n> apertures must have passed through a longer space than that which comes from\n> the other by an interval which is equal to the breadth of one, two, three,\n> or more of the supposed wavelengths, while the intervening dark spaces\n> correspond to a difference of half a supposed wavelength, of one and a half,\n> of two and a half, or more.\n\nThis description is absolutely correct but it was difficult for people to\naccept. There is something very definitely counterintuitive in claiming that\ntwo rays of light could, under certain conditions, add to give darkness. We\nshould note that Young made other notable discoveries about light, in\nparticular he realised that colour vision was due to the eye having receptors\neach of which was sensitive to one of the three colours red, green, or blue.\n\nTwo scientists who contributed to an understanding that light can be polarised\nwhen reflected from a surface were Malus and Brewster. Malus's discovery of\nthe polarisation of light by reflection was published in 1809 and his theory\nof double refraction of light in crystals was published in the following year.\nMalus transformed geometrical optics into the study of straight lines and\ntheir reflection and refraction at surfaces, see [10] for details. Brewster's\npublication in 1811 gave what is now known as Brewster's law, namely that the\nmaximum polarisation of a beam of light occurs when it strikes the surface of\na transparent medium so that the refracted ray makes an angle of 90\u00b0 with the\nreflected ray.\n\nDark lines in the spectrum of light had first been observed in 1802 by William\nWollaston but the correct explanation of them had to wait a few years until a\nmore thorough investigation by Joseph von Fraunhofer who measured the exact\npositions of over 500 such lines.\n\nA major triumph of the wave theory of light came through the work of Fresnel.\nHe appears not be have been aware of the wave theories of Huygens, Euler or\nYoung but worked out his own wave theory. The experiment he carried out which\nconvinced him of that his wave theory was correct was to place a small\nobstruction in a path of light and examine the diffraction patterns formed in\nthe shadow. In 1817 the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences proposed as their prize\ntopic for the 1819 Grand Prix a mathematical theory to explain diffraction.\nFresnel wrote a paper giving the mathematical basis for his wave theory of\nlight and in 1819 the committee, with Arago as chairman, and including\nPoisson, Biot and Laplace met to consider his work.\n\nIt was a committee which was not well disposed to the wave theory of light,\nmost believing in the corpuscular model. However Poisson was fascinated by the\nmathematical model which Fresnel proposed and succeeded in computing some of\nthe integrals to find other consequences. He wrote [1]:-\n\n> Let parallel light impinge on an opaque disk, the surrounding being\n> perfectly transparent. The disk casts a shadow - of course - but the very\n> centre of the shadow will be bright. Succinctly, there is no darkness\n> anywhere along the central perpendicular behind an opaque disk (except\n> immediately behind the disk).\n\nThis was a remarkable prediction, but Arago asked that Poisson's predictions\nbased on Fresnel's mathematical model be tested. Indeed the bright spot was\nseen to be there exactly as the theory predicted. Arago stated in his report\non Fresnel's entry for the prize to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences [1]:-\n\n> One of your commissioners, M Poisson, had deduced from the integrals\n> reported by [Fresnel] the singular result that the centre of the shadow of\n> an opaque circular screen must, when the rays penetrate there at incidences\n> which are only a little more oblique, be just as illuminated as if the\n> screen did not exist. The consequence has been submitted to the test of\n> direct experiment, and observation has perfectly confirmed the calculation.\n\nFresnel was awarded the Grand Prix and his work was a strong argument for a\ntransverse wave theory of light. Fresnel and Arago subsequently undertook\nfurther work, explaining polarisation of light with their theory. In the 1820s\nand 1830s diffraction was studied by a number of scientists; Fraunhofer\npublished his theory in 1823 while twelve years later Airy mathematically\ncalculated the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture. The next\nmajor advances were due to Faraday and Maxwell and in some sense these\ncompleted the 'classical' understanding of light. By 'classical' here we meant\npre-relativity and pre-quantum theory. We will study the developments in\nrelativity-quantum theory era in a separate article; see Light through the\nages: Relativity and quantum era. Before we move on to look at Faraday and\nMaxwell's major contributions let us look briefly at some other contributions\nfrom the middle of the 19th century.\n\nFizeau, in 1849, was the first person to calculate the speed of light without\nusing an astronomical method. He used a rotating wheel with 720 teeth to break\nup a light beam into a series of pulses. A partially reflecting mirror sent\nsome light through the wheel while some passed through. The light which passed\nthrough the wheel was sent on a journey of 17.3 kilometres before being\nreflected back to interfere with light which had passed through the partially\nreflecting mirror. He found that it took 0.00056 seconds to make the 17.3 km\njourney and he calculated a speed of 300,000 kilometres per second with an\nerror of 1000 km per sec. In the following year Foucault used the rotating\nmirror method to calculate the speed of light in air and in water, finding\nthat the speed was slower in water. The wave theory of light was by now\ncompletely established. In 1860 Bunsen and Kirchhoff observed dark lines in\nthe spectrum of a light source passed though burning substances. These were\nabsorption lines as had been observed in the solar spectrum by Wollaston and\nFraunhofer earlier.\n\nFaraday did not himself have the necessary mathematical skills but his work\nwas crucial in allowing Maxwell to develop a sophisticated mathematical theory\nbased on the understanding which Faraday had brought to the study of\nelectricity, magnetism, gravity and light. In 1845 Faraday studied the effect\nof a magnetic field on plane-polarised light. He discovered what is now called\nthe Faraday effect, namely that if a beam of light is passed through a\nsubstance which polarises it, then the plane of polarisation is rotated by a\nmagnetic field parallel to the ray of light. In 1846 Faraday gave a lecture at\nthe Royal Institution in which he put forward his view that there is a unity\nin the forces of nature. He proposed that the lines of electric and magnetic\nforce associated with atoms could provide the medium by which light waves were\npropagated:-\n\n> The view which I am so bold to put forth considers radiation as a high\n> species of vibration in the lines of force which are known to connect\n> particles, and also masses of matter together. It endeavours to dismiss the\n> aether but not the vibrations.\n\nFaraday's ideas provided the basis on which Maxwell built his mathematical\nelectromagnetic theory. One of Maxwell's first contributions to light was the\ncreation of the first colour photograph in 1861. He based his idea on Thomas\nYoung's understanding of colour vision. Young had shown that colour vision was\ndue to the eye having three types of receptors each type sensitive to one of\nthe three primary colours red, green, or blue. Maxwell took three black and\nwhite photographs of a tartan ribbon, one through a red filter, one through a\ngreen filter and one through a blue filter. At a meeting of the Royal\nInstitution, with Faraday in the audience, Maxwell projected the three images,\nthe image made with the red filter being projected with red light and\nsimilarly the others. The three images were projected on top of each other to\ncreate a colour image of the tartan ribbon on the screen.\n\nIn 1862 Maxwell realised that electromagnetic phenomena are related to light\nwhen he discovered that they travelled at the same speed. He wrote in On\nPhysical Lines of Force:-\n\n> We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the traverse\n> undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic\n> phenomena.\n\nIn 1864 Maxwell wrote a paper in which he stated (see [1]):-\n\n> This velocity is so nearly that of light that it seems we have strong reason\n> to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat and other radiations)\n> is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through\n> the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws.\n\nThe four partial differential equations, now known as Maxwell's equations,\nwhich completely describe the classical electromagnetic theory appeared in\nfully developed form in Maxwell's paper Electricity and Magnetism (1873).\nPlanck, who made one of the next major breakthoughts described in Light\nthrough the ages: Relativity and quantum era, said on the occasion of the\ncentenary of Maxwell's birth in 1931, that this theory:-\n\n> ... remains for all time one of the greatest triumphs of human intellectual\n> endeavor.\n\n### References (show)\n\n  1.
