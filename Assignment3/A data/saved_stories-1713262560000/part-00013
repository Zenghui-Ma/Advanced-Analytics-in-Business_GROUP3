As an\nemployee, it is common to treat the stock price as some externality that is\nindependent of your work.\n\nIt is paradoxical considering that the entire premise of stock based\ncompensation is that employees do have an impact on the company's valuation\nand should be incentivized to increase it by compensating them with the\ncompany's shares.\n\nIn this post, I want to assume a simple model and illustrate the game theory\nbehind this phenomenon.\n\nLet's say a company called ZikZok has n employees, and each employee is\ngranted 1 share of ZikZok's stock - meaning the company is 100% owned by its n\nemployees.\n\nNow, each employee produces v units of value for the company at c units of\ncost, meaning the employee endures c units of cost for producing v units of\nvalue (this represents the time away from other activities, difficulty of the\ntask, opportunity cost etc...). For their effort, they are compensated with a\nwage w (in addition to their one share).\n\nAdding v units of value to the company makes it proportionately more valuable\nand the stock price rises nv (if market cap rises by v and there are n shares\nin circulation, the stock rises by v/n).\n\nNow assume the employee's wage is w. If an employee works, they produce v\nunits of value and their payoff is: w+nv\u2212c+nkv, where k is the other number of\nemployees that are producing value (i.e. working).\n\nIf the employee doesn't work, they are still getting paid, and are still\ncapturing the value of the k other workers but does not endure cost c. Their\npayoff is: w+nkv.\n\nThe employee has an incentive to work if:\n\npayoff(work)\u2265payoff(slacking off)\u21d4w+nv\u2212c+nkv\u2265w+nkv\u21d4nv\u2265c\n\nAs we can see, the incentive does not depend on the employee's wage nor the\nnumber other employees working, but rather whether the employee is able to\ncapture a fraction of their value added, that is higher than the cost they\nendure.\n\nThe problem arises when n increase: the fraction nv decreases, but the cost\nendured by the employee c remains the same!\n\nThere is a point where the employee no longer has an incentive to work, which\nproduces undesirable outcomes for the company.\n\nwhat's the critical number of employees, such that each of them has an\nincentive to play?\n\nLet's call l the employee's leverage, such that v=lc. If l\u22651, the employee can\ncreate more value than the cost they endure. Moreover, for the employee to\nhave an incentive to work (recall nv\u2265c), the number of employees n should not\nexceed l.\n\nIf l<1, the employee's conversion of work to value added is inefficient and\nthere is no number of employees such that they have an incentive to work.\n\nwhat's a better incentive scheme?\n\nThe key insight from this model is that the employee's payoff should not\ndecrease as the number of employees increases.\n\nInstead of allocating 1 share per employee, let's imagine we allocate back a\nfraction f\u2208[0,1] of the value produced v, such that the payoff for working is\nnow w+fv\u2212c and the payoff for not working: w.\n\nWe can see that f should be chosen such that fv\u2265c.\n\nThis is the thinking behind commission based schemes such as sales teams or\ntraders, which own a percentage of their profit and loss.\n\nImproving the model\n\nThere are some adjustments we can make to make the model more realistic:\n\n  * we have considered the cost of working c to be constant. But, I probably won't accept an offer that I would have accepted as a new grad. For instance, if I am especially productive, I would probably have alternative offers. Moreover, if my basic needs are taken care of, the cost of spending my time working as opposed to playing with my children should grow as well. To add more realism, we can make c vary (non-linearly) with the wage w and value produced v.\n  * we have treated individual workers and their value produced as completely independent. However, cooperation might increase value created at no added cost to the employee. There are a number of dynamics that can impact an individual's cost of working c or value produced v.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nWhen I started undertaking this exercise, I expected to observe something\nsimilar to the prisoner's dilemma with n players. In that setting, almost\neverybody needs to play along in order to attain the maximal payoff, which\nbecomes exponentially unlikely with n. What happens is called a coordination\nfailure. I expected a similar \"everybody needs to play along\" scenario to come\nup in\n\nThe surprising part, to me, is that, unlike a classical prisoner's dilemma\nwith n players, the employee's incentive to work is not dependent on the\nprobability that others are working. In a prisoner's dilemma with n players,\nthere is a coordination failure where the probability that each plays along\nshould be unreasonably high, thus resulting in a nash equilibrium whose payoff\nis not maximal for any of the players.\n\n#### links\n\nx.com/timothydelille\n\nlinkedin.com/in/timothydelille\n\ngithub.com/timothydelille\n\n", "frontpage": false}
