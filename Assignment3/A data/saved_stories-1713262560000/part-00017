In laboratories all over the world,\nresearchers are now chasing a breakthrough that could kick into high gear the\ntransition to electric transportation: a rugged, compact, powerful electric\nmotor that has high power density and the ability to withstand high\ntemperatures\u2014and that doesn\u2019t have rare-earth permanent magnets.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge challenge currently preoccupying some of the best machine\ndesigners on the planet. More than a few of them are at ZF Friedrichshafen AG,\none of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of parts to the automotive industry. In\nfact, ZF astounded analysts late last year when it announced that it had built\na 220-kilowatt traction motor that used no rare-earth elements. Moreover, the\ncompany announced, their new motor had characteristics comparable to the rare-\nearth permanent-magnet synchronous motors that now dominate in electric\nvehicles. Most EVs have rare-earth-magnet-based motors ranging from 150 to 300\nkilowatts, and power densities between 1.1 and 3.0 kilowatts per kilogram.\nMeanwhile, the company says they\u2019ve developed a rare-earth-free motor right in\nthe middle of that range: 220 kW. (The comany has not yet revealed its motor\u2019s\nspecific power\u2014its kW/kg rating.)\n\nThe ZF machine is a type called a separately-excited (or doubly-excited)\nsynchronous motor. It has electromagnets in both the stator and the rotor, so\nit does away with the rare-earth permanent magnets used in the rotors of\nnearly all EV motors on the road today. In a separately-excited synchronous\nmotor, alternating current applied to the stator electromagnets sets up a\nrotating magnetic field. A separate current applied to the rotor\nelectromagnets energizes them, producing a field that locks on to the rotating\nstator field, producing torque.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, 95 percent of the rare earths are mined in China. And\nthis means that if China decides no one else will have rare earths, we can do\nnothing against it.\u201d \u2014Otmar Scharrer, ZF Friedrichshafen AG\n\nSo far, these machines have not been used much in EVs, because they require a\nseparate system to transfer power to the spinning rotor magnets, and there\u2019s\nno ideal way to do that. Many such motors use sliders and brushes to make\nelectrical contact to a spinning surface, but the brushes produce dust and\neventually wear out. Alternatively, the power can be transferred via\ninductance, but in that case the apparatus is typically cumbersome, making the\nunit complicated and physically large and heavy.\n\nNow, though, ZF says it has solved these problems with its experimental motor,\nwhich it calls I^2SM (for In-Rotor Inductive-Excited Synchronous Motor).\nBesides not using any rare earth elements, the motor offers a few other\nadvantages in comparison with permanent-magnet synchronous motors. These are\nlinked to the fact that this kind of motor technology offers the ability to\nprecisely control the magnetic field in the rotor\u2014something that\u2019s not\npossible with permanent magnets. That control, in turn, permits varying the\nfield to get much higher efficiency at high speed, for example.\n\nWith headquarters in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, ZF Friedrichshafen AG is\nknown for a rich R&D heritage and many commercially successful innovations\ndating back to 1915, when it began supplying gears and other parts for\nZeppelins. Today, the company has some 168,000 employees in 31 countries.\nAmong the customers for its motors and electric drive trains are Mercedes-\nBenz, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover. (Late last year, shortly after announcing\nthe I^2SM, the company announced the sale of its 3,000,000^th motor.)\n\nHas ZF just shown the way forward for rare-earth-free EV motors? To learn more\nabout the I ^2SM and ZF\u2019s vision of the future of EV traction motors, Spectrum\nreached out to Otmar Scharrer, ZF\u2019s Senior Vice President, R&D, of Electrified\nPowertrain Technology. Our interview with him has been edited for concision\nand clarity.\n\nOtmar Scharrer on...\n\n  * The I2SM\u2019s technical bona fides\n  * The most promising concepts for future motors\n  * The motor\u2019s coils, efficiency, and cooling\n  * The prototypes built to date\n  * The challenges the team overcame\n\nIEEE Spectrum: Why is it important to eliminate or to reduce the use of rare-\nearth elements in traction motors?\n\nZF Friedrichshafen AG\u2019s Otmar Scharrer is leading a team discovering ways to\nbuild motors that don\u2019t depend on permanent magnets\u2014and China\u2019s rare-earth\nmonopolies. ZF Group\n\nOtmar Scharrer: Well, there are two reasons for that. One is sustainability.\nWe call them \u201crare earth\u201d because they really are rare in the earth. You need\nto move a lot of soil to get to these materials. Therefore, they have a\nrelatively high footprint because, usually, they are dug out of the earth in a\nmine with excavators and huge trucks. That generates some environmental\npollution and, of course, a change of the landscape. That is one thing. The\nother is that they are relatively expensive. And of course, this is something\nwe always address cautiously as a tier one [automotive industry supplier].\n\nAnd as a matter of fact, 95 percent of the rare earths are produced in China.\nAnd this means that if China decides no one else will have rare earths, we can\ndo nothing against it. The recycling circle [for rare earth elements] will not\nwork because there are just not enough electric motors out there. They still\nhave an active lifetime. When you are ramping up, when you have a steep ramp\nup in terms of volume, you never can satisfy your demands with recycling.\nRecycling will only work if you have a constant business and you\u2019re just\nreplacing those units which are failing. I\u2019m sure this will come, but we see\nthis much later when the steep ramp-up has ended.\n\n\u201cThe power density is the same as for a permanent-magnet machine, because we\nproduce both. And I can tell you that there is no difference.\u201d \u2014Otmar\nScharrer, ZF Friedrichshafen AG\n\nYou had asked a very good question: How much rare-earth metal does a typical\ntraction motor contain? I had to ask my engineers. This is an interesting\nquestion. Most of our electric motors are in the range of 150 to 300\nkilowatts. This is the main range of power for passenger cars. And those\nmotors typically have 1.5 kilograms of magnet material. And 0.5 percent to 1\npercent out of this material is pure [heavy rare-earth elements]. So this is\nnot too much. It\u2019s only 5 to 15 grams. But, yes, it\u2019s a very difficult-to-get\nmaterial.\n\nThis is the reason for this [permanent-] magnet-free motor. The concept itself\nis not new. It has been used for years and years, for decades, because\nusually, power generation is done with this kind of electric machine. So if\nyou have a huge power plant, for example, a gas power plant, then you would\ntypically find such an externally-excited machine as a generator.\n\nWe did not use them for passenger cars or for mobile applications because of\ntheir weight and size. And some of that weight-and-size problem comes directly\nfrom the need to generate a magnetic field in the rotor, to replace the\n[permanent] magnets. You need to set copper coils under electricity. So you\nneed to carry electric current inside the rotor. This is usually done with\nsliders. And those sliders generate losses. This is the one thing because you\nhave, typically, carbon brushes touching a metal ring so that you can conduct\nthe electricity.\n\nBack to top\n\nThose brushes are what make the unit longer, axially, in the direction of the\naxle?\n\nScharrer: Exactly. That\u2019s the point. And you need an inverter which is able to\nexcite the electric machine. Normal inverters have three phases, and then you\nneed a fourth phase to electrify the rotor. And this is a second obstacle.\nMany OEMs or e-mobility companies do not have this technology ready.\nSurprisingly enough, the first ones who brought this into serious production\nwere [Renault]. It was a very small car, a Renault. [Editor's note: the model\nwas the Zoe, which was manufactured from 2013 until March of this year.]\n\nIt had a relatively weak electric motor, just 75 or 80 kilowatts. They decided\nto do this because in an electric vehicle, there\u2019s a huge advantage with this\nkind of externally excited machine. You can switch off and switch on the\nmagnetic field. This is a great safety advantage. Why safety? Think about it.\nIf your bicycle has a generator [for a headlight], it works like an electric\nmotor. If you are moving and the generator is spinning, connected to the\nwheel, then it is generating electricity.\n\n\u201cWe have an efficiency of approximately 96 percent. So, very little loss.\u201d\n\u2014Otmar Scharrer, ZF Friedrichshafen AG\n\nThe same is happening in an electric machine in the car. If you are driving on\nthe highway at 75 miles an hour, and then suddenly your whole system breaks\ndown, what would happen? In a permanent magnet motor, you would generate\nenormous voltage because the rotor magnets are still rotating in the stator\nfield. But in a permanent-magnet-free motor, nothing happens. You are just\nswitched off. So it is self-secure. This is a nice feature.\n\nAnd the second feature is even better if you drive at high speed. High speed\nis something like 75, 80, 90 miles an hour. It\u2019s not too common in most\ncountries. But it\u2019s a German phenomenon, very important here.\n\nPeople like to drive fast. Then you need to address the area of field\nweakening because [at high speed], the magnetic field would be too strong. You\nneed to weaken the field. And if you don\u2019t have [permanent] magnets, it\u2019s\neasy: you just adapt the electrically-induced magnetic field to the\nappropriate value, and you don\u2019t have this field-weakening requirement. And\nthis results in much higher efficiency at high speeds.\n\nYou called this field weakening at high speed?\n\nScharrer: You need to weaken the magnetic field in order to keep the operation\nstable. And this weakening happens by additional electricity coming from the\nbattery. And therefore, you have a lower efficiency of the electric motor.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat are the most promising concepts for future EV motors?\n\nScharrer: We believe that our concept is most promising, because as you\npointed out a couple of minutes ago, we are growing in actual length when we\ndo an externally excited motor. We thought a lot what we can do to overcome\nthis obstacle. And we came to the conclusion, let\u2019s do it inductively, by\nelectrical inductance. And this has been done by competitors as well, but they\nsimply replaced the slider rings with inductance transmitters.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that we can build the same size, the same power level of\nelectric motors as with the permanent magnets.\u201d \u2014Otmar Scharrer, ZF\nFriedrichshafen AG\n\nAnd this did not change the situation. What we did, we were shrinking the\ninductive unit to the size of the rotor shaft, and then we put it inside the\nshaft. And therefore, we reduced this 50-to-90-millimeter growth in axial\nlength. And therefore, as a final result, you know the motor shrinks, the\nhousing gets smaller, you have less weight, and you have the same performance\ndensity in comparison with a PSM [permanent-magnet synchronous motor] machine.\n\nWhat is an inductive exciter exactly?\n\nScharrer: Inductive exciter means nothing else than that you transmit\nelectricity without touching anything. You do it with a magnetic field. And we\nare doing it inside of the rotor shaft. This is where the energy is\ntransmitted from outside to the shaft [and then to the rotor electromagnets].\n\nSo the rotor shaft, is that different from the motor shaft, the actual torque\nshaft?\n\nScharrer: It\u2019s the same.\n\nThe thing I know with inductance is in a transformer, you have coils next to\neach other and you can induce a voltage from the energized coil in the other\ncoil.\n\nScharrer: This is exactly what is happening in our rotor shafts.\n\nBack to top\n\nSo you use coils, specially designed, and you induce voltage from one to the\nother?\n\nScharrer: Yes. And we have a very neat, small package, which has a diameter of\nless than 30 millimeters. If you can shrink it to that value, then you can put\nit inside the rotor shaft.\n\nSo of course, if you have two coils, and they\u2019re spaced next to each other,\nyou have a gap. So that gap enables you to spin, right? Since they\u2019re not\ntouching, they can spin independently. So you had to design something where\nthe field could be transferred. In other words, they could couple even though\none of them was spinning.\n\nScharrer: We have a coil in the rotor shaft, which is rotating with the shaft.\nAnd then we have another one that is stationary inside the rotor shaft while\nthe shaft rotates around it. And there is an air gap in between. Everything\nhappens inside the rotor shaft.\n\nWhat is the efficiency? How much power do you lose?\n\nScharrer: We have an efficiency of approximately 96 percent. So, very little\nloss. And for the magnetic field, you don\u2019t need a lot of energy. You need\nsomething between 10 and 15 kilowatts for the electric field. Let\u2019s assume a\ntransmitted power of 10 kilowatts, we\u2019ll have losses of about 400 watts. This\n[relatively low level of loss] is important because we don\u2019t cool the unit\nactively and therefore it needs this kind of high efficiency.\n\nThe motor isn\u2019t cooled with liquids?\n\nScharrer: The motor itself is actively cooled, with oil, but the inductive\nunit is passively cooled, with heat transfer to nearby cooling structures.\n\n\u201cA good invention is always easy. If you look as an engineer on good IP, then\nyou say, \u2018Okay, that looks nice.\u2019\u201d \u2014Otmar Scharrer, ZF Friedrichshafen AG\n\nWhat are the largest motors you\u2019ve built or what are the largest motors you\nthink you can build, in kilowatts?\n\nScharrer: We don\u2019t think that there is a limitation with this technology. We\nare convinced that we can build the same size, the same power level of\nelectric motors as with the permanent magnets.\n\nYou could do 150- or 300-kilowatt motors?\n\nScharrer: Absolutely.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat have you done so far? What prototypes have you built?\n\nScharrer: We have a prototype with 220 kilowatts. And we can easily upgrade it\nto 300, for example. Or we can shrink it to 150. That is always easy.\n\nAnd what is your specific power of this motor?\n\nScharrer: You mean kilowatts per kilogram? I can\u2019t tell you, to be quite\nhonest. It\u2019s hard to compare, because it always depends on where the\nborderline is. You never have a motor by itself. You always need a housing as\nwell. What part of the housing are you including in the calculation? But I can\ntell you one thing: The power density is the same as for a permanent-magnet\nmachine because we produce both. And I can tell you that there is no\ndifference.\n\nWhat automakers do you currently have agreements with? Are you providing\nelectric motors for certain automakers? Who are some of your customers now?\n\nScharrer: We are providing our dedicated hybrid transmissions to BMW, to\nJaguar Land Rover, and our electric-axle drives to Mercedes-Benz and Geely\nLotus, for example. And we are, of course, in development with a lot of other\napplications. And I think you understand that I cannot talk about that.\n\nSo for BMW, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, you\u2019re providing electric motors and\ndrivetrain components?\n\nScharrer: BMW and Land Rover. We provide dedicated hybrid transmissions. We\nprovide an eight-speed automatic transmission with a hybrid electric motor up\nto 160 kilowatts. It\u2019s one of the best hybrid transmissions because you can\ndrive fully electrically with 160 kilowatts, which is quite something.\n\n\u201cWe achieved the same values, for power density and other characteristics, for\nas for a [permanent] magnet motor. And this is really a breakthrough because\naccording to our best knowledge, this never happened before.\u201d \u2014Otmar Scharrer,\nZF Friedrichshafen AG\n\nWhat were the major challenges you had to overcome, to transmit the power\ninside the rotor shaft?\n\nBack to top\n\nScharrer: The major challenge is, always, it needs to be very small. At the\nsame time, it needs to be super reliable, and it needs to be easy.\n\nA good invention is always easy. When you see it, if you look as an engineer\non good IP [intellectual property], then you say, \u201cOkay, that looks nice\u201d\u2014it\u2019s\nquite obvious that it\u2019s a good idea. If the idea is complex and it needs to be\nexplained and you don\u2019t understand it, then usually this is not a good idea to\nbe implemented. And this one is very easy. Straightforward. It\u2019s a good idea:\nShrink it, put it into the rotor shaft.\n\nSo you mean very easy to explain?\n\nScharrer: Yes. Easy to explain because it\u2019s obviously an interesting idea. You\njust say, \u201cLet\u2019s use part of the rotor shaft for the transmission of the\nelectricity into the rotor shaft, and then we can cut the additional length\nout of the magnet-free motor.\u201d Okay. That\u2019s a good answer.\n\nWe have a lot of IP here. This is important because if you have the idea, I\nmean, the idea is the main thing.\n\nWhat were the specific savings in weight and rotor shaft and so on?\n\nScharrer: Well, again, I would just answer in a very general way. We achieved\nthe same values, for power density and other characteristics, for as for a\n[permanent] magnet motor. And this is really a breakthrough because according\nto our best knowledge, this never happened before.\n\nDo you think the motor will be available before the end of this year or\nperhaps next year?\n\nScharrer: You mean available for a serious application?\n\nYes. If Volkswagen came to you and said, \u201cLook, we want to use this in our\nnext car,\u201d could you do that before the end of this year, or would it have to\nbe 2025?\n\nScharrer: It would have to be 2025. I mean, technically, the electric motor is\nvery far along. It is already in an A-sample status, which means we are...\n\nWhat kind of status?\n\nScharrer: A-sample. In the automotive industry, you have A, B, or C. For\nA-sample, you have all the functions, and you have all the features of the\nproduct, and those are secured. And then B- is, you are not producing any\nlonger in the prototype shop, but you are producing close to a possibly\nserious production line. C-sample means you are producing on serious fixtures\nand tools, but not on a [mass-production] line. And so this is an A-sample,\nmeaning it is about one and a half years away from a conventional SOP [\"Start\nof Production\"] with our customer. So we could be very fast.\n\nThis article was updated on 15 April 2024. An earlier version of this article\ngave an incorrect figure for the efficiency of the inductive exciter used in\nthe motor. This efficiency is 96 percent, not 98 or 99 percent.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * In Mahle's Contact-Free Electric Motor, Power Reaches the Rotor Wirelessly \u203a\n  * Who Will Free EV Motors from the Rare Earth Monopoly? \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * How Do All-Electric Cars Work? - Alternative Fuels Data Center \u203a\n\nchinaelectric motorselectric vehiclesgermanypermanent magnetspower densityrare\nearth elementssustainabilityautomotivetechnology & computingbusiness and\nfinanceeducationhome & gardenautomotive productsauto technologygreen\nvehiclesluxury carsartificial intelligencecomputingbusinesseconomyinternetit\nand internet supportweb developmentprogramming languagesbusiness i.t.small and\nmedium-sized businessstartups\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nGlenn Zorpette\n\nGlenn Zorpette is editorial director for content development at IEEE Spectrum.\nA Fellow of the IEEE, he holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering\nfrom Brown University.\n\nThe Conversation (0)\n\nSort by\n\nArtificial IntelligenceNews\n\n## 15 Graphs That Explain the State of AI in 2024\n\n8 hours ago\n\n6 min read\n\nTransportationNewsClimate TechClimate Change\n\n## E-Bikes Are Growing Up, Finding Jobs, Still Having Fun\n\n14 Apr 2024\n\n7 min read\n\n1\n\nSemiconductorsMagazineFeature\n\n## The Tiny Ultrabright Laser that Can Melt Steel\n\n14 Apr 2024\n\n12 min read\n\n1\n\n## Related Stories\n\nTransportationNews\n\n## GM and Stellantis Back Rare-Earth-Free Permanent Magnet\n\nTransportationAnalysis\n\n## What Is Tesla\u2019s Mystery Magnet?\n\nTransportationNews\n\n## Electric Motor Enables Chain-Free Bike-by-Wire\n\n", "frontpage": false}
