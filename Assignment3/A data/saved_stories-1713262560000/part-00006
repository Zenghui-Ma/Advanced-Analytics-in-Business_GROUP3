But C being a low level\nlanguage also means it lacks a lot of other stuff other popular languages\nhave; for instance, dynamic arrays are present in the library of most popular\nlanguages, be it JavaScript, C++, Rust and so on, but C\u2019s simplicity forbids\nthem from being there. If you want it in C, you have to implement it \u2013which is\nexactly what I did!\n\nroot\n\nOct 24\n\nprogramming\n\nUnified Versus Split Diff\n\nWhich is better for code reviews, a unified diff or a split diff?\n\nroot\n\nOct 24\n\nprogramming\n\nCraig Stuntz - On Learning Compilers and Creating Programming Languages\n\nWhen I first started learning about compilers, there was something important\nwhich I didn\u2019t understand: Designing a programming language and writing a\ncompiler are two almost entirely different skills.
