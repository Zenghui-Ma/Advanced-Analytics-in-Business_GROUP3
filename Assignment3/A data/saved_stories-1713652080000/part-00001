It is based on the Portuguese dish carne de vinha d'alhos.^[1]^[2]^[3] It is\nknown globally in its British Indian form as a staple of curry house and\nIndian restaurant menus and is often regarded as a fiery, spicy dish. The\ntraditional recipe uses pork, but alternative versions have been prepared with\nbeef, mutton, prawns, chicken, lamb, vegetables and tofu.^[4]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nA standard element of Goan cuisine derived from the Portuguese carne de vinha\nd'alhos (meat in wine and garlic marinade; literally \"meat of wine of\ngarlic\"^[5]), a vindaloo is a dish of meat (usually pork) marinated in vinegar\nand garlic.^[3]^[6] The basic structure of the Portuguese dish was the\nPortuguese sailor's \"preserved\" raw ingredients, packed in wooden barrels of\nalternate layers of pork and garlic, and soaked in red wine.^[citation needed]\nThis was adapted by the local Goan cooks with the substitution of palm vinegar\nfor the red wine, and the addition of spices. It evolved into the localized\nand easy-to-pronounce dish \"vindaloo\".^[7]\n\nThe British Indian version of vindaloo calls for the meat to be marinated in\nvinegar, sugar, fresh ginger and spices, then cooked with more spices.^[3]\n\n## Traditional Goan preparation and Indian variations[edit]\n\nRestaurants in Goa offering traditional Goan cuisine prepare vindalho with\npork, which is the original recipe. Christians from Kochi, Kerala prepare\nusing pork or beef, the former being more widely consumed and made. The dish\nwas popularized by Goan cooks (whom the British favoured, because they had no\nissues in kitchens and bars when handling beef, pork or alcohol) in the\nBritish establishments and the ocean-going liners. Restaurants in other parts\nof India prepare vindalho with other meats (like beef (second most popular),\nchicken or goat meat or lamb) or even seafood because of local taboos against\npork, and these meats are sometimes mixed with cubed potatoes to reduce\npreparation costs.\n\nEven though the word aloo (\u0906\u0932\u0942) means potato in Hindi,^[8] traditional Goan\nvindalho does not include potatoes; the name is from Portuguese with no Hindi\netymology. Some Indian versions do include potatoes due to the confusion with\nthe Hindi aloo,^[9] and vindaloo dishes outside India often include potatoes.\n\nPrawn vindaloo served with plain rice\n\n## Outside India[edit]\n\nPork vindalho, served in Lisbon, Portugal, in a Goan-style Indian\nrestaurantLamb vindaloo served in Helsinki, Finland\n\nVindaloo has gained popularity outside of India, where it is typically\nfeatured on menus at Indian restaurants. Vindaloo served in restaurants of the\nUnited Kingdom differs from the original vindaloo dish; it is simply a spicier\nversion of the standard \"medium (spiciness)\" restaurant curry with the\naddition of vinegar, potatoes and chili peppers.^[10]\n\nVindaloo is one of the spiciest dishes available on British Asian menus where\nit is served, although British Bangladeshi restaurants have innovated the\ntindaloo, which is a quite different dish that originated in Bangladesh.^[10]\nThe British variation originated from British Bangladeshi restaurants in the\n1970s. Vindaloo is considered a predecessor to phall.^[11]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of topics on the Portuguese Empire in the East\n  * Anglo-Indian cuisine\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Menon, Smitha (23 June 2020). \"How did the Goan vindaloo get to you?\".
