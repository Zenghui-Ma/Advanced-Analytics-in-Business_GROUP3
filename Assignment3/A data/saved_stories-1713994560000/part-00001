But in low- and middle-income countries, Nestl\u00e9 adds\nsugar to those same baby products, sometimes at high levels, which could lead\nchildren to prefer sugary diets and unhealthy eating habits, according to an\ninvestigation released recently by nonprofit groups.\n\nThe investigation, conducted by Public Eye and the International Baby Food\nAction Network (IBFAN), says the addition of added sugars to baby foods in\npoorer countries, against expert recommendations, creates an \"unjustifiable\ndouble standard.\" The groups quote Rodrigo Vianna, an epidemiologist and\nprofessor at the Department of Nutrition of the Federal University of Para\u00edba\nin Brazil, who calls added sugars in baby foods \"unnecessary and highly\naddictive.\"\n\n\"Children get used to the sweet taste and start looking for more sugary foods,\nstarting a negative cycle that increases the risk of nutrition-based disorders\nin adult life,\" Vianna told the organizations for their investigation. \"These\ninclude obesity and other chronic non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes\nor high blood-pressure.\"\n\nThe two groups compared the nutritional content of Nestl\u00e9's Cerelac and Nido\nproducts, the company's best-selling baby food brands in low- and middle-\nincome countries that generate sales of over $2.5 billion. In a Cerelac wheat\ncereal product, for instance, the product contained up to 6 grams of added\nsugar in countries including Thailand, Ethiopia, South Africa, Pakistan,\nIndia, and Bangladesh. In the United Kingdom and Germany, the same product\ncontained zero added sugars.\n\nThe product with the highest sugar content was a Cerelac baby cereal product\nsold in the Philippines with 7.3 grams of sugar. While children under age 2\nare recommended to have zero grams of added sugars in their diet, for\nreference, children aged 2 to 18 are recommended to have less than 25 grams\n(about six teaspoons) per day by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Philippines, where the sugar content was the highest, and in other\ncountries\u2014including Nigeria, Senegal, Vietnam and Pakistan\u2014the added sugar\ncontent was not listed on Nestl\u00e9's labeling, the investigation found.\n\n## Double standard\n\n\"There is a double standard here that can\u2019t be justified,\u201d Nigel Rollins, a\nWHO scientist, told the nonprofit groups. Rollins pointed out that the company\ndoes not add sugars to its baby products in Switzerland, where the company is\nheadquartered. Thus, continuing to add it in low-resource settings is\n\"problematic both from a public health and ethical perspective,\" he said.\n\nIn a report last month, the WHO found that as of 2022, 37 million children\nunder the age of 5 worldwide had overweight. Additionally, over 390 million\nchildren ages 5 to 19 had overweight and 160 million had obesity. The\nprevalence of overweight in children 5 to 19 rose from 8 percent in 1990 to 20\npercent in 2022, the United Nations agency noted. Obesity rates in this age\ngroup, meanwhile, rose from 2 percent to 8 percent in the same timespan.\n\nNestl\u00e9 responded to the investigation with a statement suggesting that the\ndifferences in sugar content \"depend on several factors, including regulations\nand availability of local ingredients, which can result in offerings with\nlower or no-added sugars.\" But it argued that these differences do not\n\"compromise the nutritional value of our products for infants and young\nchildren.\"\n\nNestl\u00e9 is a multinational food and drink behemoth with a controversial history\nof selling baby products in poorer countries. In the 1970s and '80s, the\ncompany came under heavy international fire for aggressively marketing its\nbaby formula to impoverished mothers. Health advocates accused Nestl\u00e9 of\nmisleading mothers into thinking formula is better than breast milk for their\nbabies, even though leading health organizations recommend exclusive\nbreastfeeding for the first six months of life when possible.\n\nCritics accused Nestl\u00e9 of providing free formula to hospital maternity wards,\ncausing new, low-income mothers to turn to it shortly after birth in the\ncritical window in which breast milk production would otherwise ramp up in\nresponse to nursing a newborn. Without nursing in that time, mothers can\nstruggle to lactate and become dependent on formula. Out of the hospital, the\npowdered formula is no longer free and must be mixed in proper amounts and in\nsanitary conditions to ensure it is safe and meeting the nutritional needs of\nthe infant, which can be a struggle for poor families.\n\nNestl\u00e9 now states that it follows international standards for marketing\nbreast-milk substitutes, despite ongoing boycotts in some countries.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n86\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
