Should I load the data at the start, or when I need it?\n  2. Once I have the data, should I save it for reuse?\n\nThe answers to these questions give you the four patterns of data loading:\n\n  1. Lazy Load \u2013 Load as needed, don\u2019t reuse\n  2. Pre-Fetch \u2013 Load at the beginning, don\u2019t reuse\n  3. Read Through Cache \u2013 Load as needed, save the results for reuse\n  4. Pre-Cache \u2013 Load all the data at the beginning\n\nEach pattern has pros and cons:\n\nPicking the right, or wrong, pattern for you use case can have major\nperformance and scaling implications.\n\nThese are the main questions to ask yourself:\n\n  * How often does the data change?\n  * How important is the performance of the code\u2019s critical path?\n  * How likely am I to reuse the data?\n  * How much do I know about the data I need?\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### jeffpsherman\n\n### Post Navigation\n\nPrevious Post:\n\n#### Frosting A Turd And Iterating To A Cupcake\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n#### When a 33% Success Rate Outperforms 99.999%\n\nOctober 12, 2023 jeffpsherman\n\n#### Smile And Dial CRM, A Fable About Transforming Fundamental Constraints\n\nJune 21, 2023 jeffpsherman\n\n#### First, AI will do unprofitable programming work\n\nMarch 11, 2024 jeffpsherman\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n### Site Sidebar\n\n#### Categories\n\n  * crm\n  * Cross Post\n  * dev teams\n  * iterative delivery\n  * podcast\n  * software design\n  * Uncategorized\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * ##### Four Patterns Of Data Loading\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * ##### Frosting A Turd And Iterating To A Cupcake\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Fifty, Fulfilling Friday \u2013 Saving Customers Millions\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Nine, Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Projects Part 2\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  * ##### Fixing All The Bugs Won\u2019t Solve All The Problems \u2013 Deming\u2019s Path Of Frustration\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n#### Tags\n\n#batr #best-alternative-to-a-total-rewrite #development #neverrewrite #SaaS\nadvice ai always be releasing automation batr best-alternative-to-a-total-\nrewrite crm iterative delivery never rewrite podcast programming queues SaaS\nsame but better scaling software architecture software development team\ndynamics Tenancy Model testing TheeSeeShip\n\n### Site Footer\n\n## Discover more from Sherman On Software\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\nLoading Comments...\n\n%d\n\n", "frontpage": false}
