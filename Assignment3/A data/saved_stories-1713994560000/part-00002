According to MacRumors,\niPadOS 18 may finally be the update that brings a version of Apple's first-\nparty Calculator app to the iPad.\n\nCalculator was one of the very first iPhone apps that shipped with the iPhone\nback in 2007 but was mysteriously and inexplicably absent from the iPad when\nit launched in 2010. It's also the very last of those original missing apps to\nfind its way to the iPad's home screen\u2014Stocks, Clock, Voice Memos, and Weather\nhad all made the jump previously, with the Weather app coming as recently as\n2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's not that the iPad is incapable of calculating; the Spotlight search\nfeature can already handle basic off-the-cuff math and conversion questions,\nand third-party calculator apps like PCalc, Numerical2, Calcbot, and\ninnumerable free-to-download no-name calculator apps have stepped up to fill\nthe gap. But it was never clear why Apple decided against shipping a first-\nparty Calculator app with the iPad, when it had shipped one with every iPhone\nsince 2007 and every Mac since 1984.\n\nThe new Calculator app should be more than just a straightforward port of the\ncurrent iOS or macOS app. Apple is apparently planning a small overhaul of the\nCalculator app for macOS 15 with a history tape for tracking past\ncalculations, a resizable window, and an updated round-button design that more\nclosely imitates the iOS version. The iPad and macOS versions of many of\nApple's apps share a lot of code these days\u2014Stocks, Voice Memos, News, Home,\nWeather, Clock, and others share essentially the same design and layout in\nboth operating systems\u2014so it's a fair bet that this redesigned Mac app and the\nnewly introduced iPad app will be the same software.\n\nAt least one developer of a prominent iPad calculator seemed undaunted by the\nnews that his app could be Sherlocked this fall.\n\n\"Yes, I saw the MacRumors article,\" wrote PCalc developer James Thomson on his\nMastodon account, responding to no one in particular. \"Yes, it's fine.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n83\n\nAndrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with\na focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of\noperating systems like Windows and macOS.
