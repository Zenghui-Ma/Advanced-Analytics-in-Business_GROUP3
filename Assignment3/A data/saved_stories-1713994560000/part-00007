This paper shows that\n> recent large models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E3 also share the\n> vulnerability of human intelligence, namely the \"white bear phenomenon\". We\n> investigate the causes of the white bear phenomenon by analyzing their\n> representation space. Based on this analysis, we propose a simple prompt-\n> based attack method, which generates figures prohibited by the LM provider's\n> policy. To counter these attacks, we introduce prompt-based defense\n> strategies inspired by cognitive therapy techniques, successfully mitigating\n> attacks by up to 48.22\\%.\n\nComments:| This paper is accepted in CVPRW  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.15154 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.15154v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Junhoo Lee [view email] [v1] Mon, 22 Apr 2024 08:28:13 UTC (32,282 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Do not think pink elephant!, by Kyomin Hwang\nand 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
