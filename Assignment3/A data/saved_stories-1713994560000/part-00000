And NASA's space-based\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) caught it on camera.\n\nSolar flares are explosions from the sun's surface that emit intense bursts of\nelectromagnetic radiation. They occur when magnetic energy builds up in the\nsolar atmosphere and is rapidly released.\n\nThe quartet of eruptions came from four regions, three sunspots and one\nmagnetic filament, separated by hundreds of thousands of miles and linked by\nnear-invisible magnetic loops in the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the\ncorona. These kinds of explosions are called \"sympathetic solar flares,\"\naccording to Spaceweather.com. They consist of pairs of explosions that occur\nin near unison at different regions on the sun's disk. This morning's event\nconsisted of not a simple pair but a quartet, making it \"super-sympathetic\",\naccording to Spaceweather.com.\n\nRelated: Space weather can make it hard to predict satellite trajectories.\nHere's why that's a problem\n\nSympathetic solar flares are triggered when instabilities rapidly travel from\none region to another along the magnetic loops that join them. As such, much\nof the Earth-facing portion of the sun was involved in this morning's solar\nsymphony.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n\u2014 Space weather: What is it and how is it predicted?\n\n\u2014 Widespread solar storm struck spacecraft near the sun, Earth and even Mars\n\n\u2014 Powerful X-class solar flare slams Earth, triggering radio blackout over the\nPacific Ocean\n\nWe will have to wait and see if any of the ejected material from the super-\nsympathetic eruption will impact Earth, as there is a possibility of an Earth-\ndirected coronal mass ejection (CME). CMEs are huge expulsions of plasma and\nmagnetic fields from the sun. When Earth-directed, they can wreak havoc with\npower grids, telecommunication networks and orbiting satellites and expose\nastronauts to dangerous doses of radiation.\n\nThe sun just blasted out 4 solar eruptions in near-unison.

If just one of them grazes Earth's magnetic\nfield a minor-class G1 geomagnetic storm could be triggered. The most likely\nimpact dates are April 25 and April 26.\n\nThe quadruple blast today could be a sign we are nearing solar maximum, the\npeak of solar activity during the sun's 11-year solar cycle, as sympathetic\nsolar flares are considered to increase with an increase in solar activity. Or\nperhaps we have already reached solar maximum and are entering the decay phase\nof the solar cycle, as a 2022 study published in Astrophysics and Space\nScience suggests that sympathetic solar flares predominantly occur in the\ndecay phase of the solar cycle.\n\nEither way, scientists won't know when solar maximum has occurred until seven\nmonths after it's over due to how the maximum is computed.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!
