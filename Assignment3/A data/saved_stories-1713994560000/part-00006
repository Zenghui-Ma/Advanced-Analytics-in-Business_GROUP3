This paper\n> presents the results of an analysis of the math requirements of 199 Computer\n> Science BS/BA degrees from 158 U.S. universities, looking not only at which\n> math courses are required, but how they are used as prerequisites (and\n> corequisites) for computer science (CS) courses. Our analysis shows that\n> while there is consensus that discrete math is critical for a CS degree, and\n> further that calculus is almost always required for the BS in CS, there is\n> little consensus as to when a student should have mastered these subjects.\n> Based on our analysis of how math requirements impact access, retention and\n> on-time degree completion for the BS and the BA in CS, we provide several\n> recommendations for CS departments to consider.\n\nComments:| 13 pages, accepted to Communications of the ACM  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computers and Society (cs.CY)  \nACM classes:| K.3.2  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.15177 [cs.CY]  \n(or arXiv:2404.15177v1 [cs.CY] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.15177arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Mark Weiss [view email] [v1] Tue, 23 Apr 2024 16:16:37 UTC (1,118 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled An Analysis of the Math Requirements of 199 CS\nBS/BA Degrees at 158 U.S. Universities, by Carla E.
