What will happen next? Will ByteDance get this overturned in court?\nHow much is TikTok US worth? Will Oracle and Walmart bid again, or who else\nmight buy it?\n\nWe researched this to provide the statements, facts, and historical precedent\nthat best predict the outcomes.\n\n## Summary of findings\n\n  * Biden will sign the Senate bill (>95%)\n\n  * The Commerce Secretary will start the 12 month clock on TikTok (>95%)\n\n  * ByteDance will challenge the ruling (>95%), which may delay the clock starting to delist or divest, but they have only a ~20% chance to win\n\n  * And if they lose, they will succeed in selling to a US company (75%)\n\n  * The sale will be for $30-50B (CI 50%), assuming it does not include certain ByteDance IP\n\n  * Walmart and Oracle won\u2019t compete to buy it this time. Microsoft or Amazon are the top contenders, along with a consortium led by Susquehanna or Steven Mnuchin, possibly in partnership with Snap or X.\n\n## Detailed findings\n\n### Will TikTok win in its soon-to-come suit against the Department of\nCommerce?\n\nGiven their public statements, it's nearly certain that Biden will sign the\nbill, the Commerce Secretary will initiate the process to compel ByteDance to\ndelist/divest TikTok US, and ByteDance will challenge the bill to get the ban\noverturned. So the first big question is, how can we infer whether ByteDance\nwill prevail against the CFIUS and the Department of Commerce to get the\nruling overturned?\n\nFirst, we expect that the case will most likely be heard by a DC District\nCourt judge. One likely candidate is Chief Judge James Boasberg, who is\npartial to Congress and the President:\n\nThat said, courts have struck down bans like this on First Amendment grounds:\nYou can interact with this widget, and the below, on FutureSearch.\n\nWe also find that most similar cases to TikTok's forthcoming suit rarely\nsucceed. ByteDance prevailed against Trump in 2020, but that was an executive\norder, not congressional legislation. Tencent, Huawei, ZTE, China Telecom,\nChina Mobile International, Sberbank of Russia, have all lost in similar\ncases, given an overall estimate of a 13% historical success rate:\n\nStill, overall we give TikTok a 20% chance, higher than this 13% statistic, as\nByteDance's case might be a lot stronger than the historical norm.\n\n### If they fail to overturn the ban, will TikTok succeed in divesting or will\nthey be forced to delist from US app stores?\n\nWe find that in most similar cases to what TikTok is facing, action from the\nCFIUS on national security grounds, in all 5 instances, the company managed to\nsell their US operations on time, instead of shutting their US businesses\ndown:\n\nThe most similar case is Grindr. One difference is that the Chinese company\nKunlun didn't found Grindr, but purchased it in 2018. In 2019, the CFIUS gave\nthem until June 2020 to sell Grindr to a US company, citing national security\nconcerns (presumably because it had information on the private sexual\npreferences of Americans, which is similar to how CFIUS sees TikTok). Kunlun\ndid so, selling to San Vicente Acquisition for ~$600 million.\n\nNotably, this isn't all action under Trump. The same thing occurred in 2012\nwith Ralls Corporation, where the CFIUS required it to divest its US wind-farm\nproject.\n\nFinally, we predict there would be a huge political backlash if TikTok were in\nfact delisted from the Google and App stores. The app is used by half of all\nAmericans under 30, so the motivation to find a deal of some kind will be very\nhigh.\n\nThe reasons they might fail relate to ByteDance IP, and the presumed very high\nprice, as covered below.\n\n### If they sell, how much will it sell for?\n\nHere, we are much less confident, giving this distribution:\n\nThe most important variable we find is whether TikTok US will include\nByteDance's famous recommendation algorithm, or equivalent. China has stated\nthat this is proprietary and not for sale. TikTok US could presumably make a\nsimilar algorithm, or privately license it. How much of the value is in the\nalgorithm vs. the userbase? We don't know, so this gives us a very wide\nconfidence interval.\n\n### Who will buy it?\n\nThis scenario, depending on all the above - the lawsuit, the price, the\nalgorithm - is the most speculative. But we can reason about the potential\nbuyers from their public statements, especially in how they conducted\nthemselves when ByteDance prepared to sell TikTok US in 2020. We can also\nreason from the presumed very high price.\n\nIn 2020, Walmart and Oracle were the top contenders. TikTok US has in fact\nmoved a lot of its compute to the Oracle Cloud. But we consider these two\nunlikely candidates, for financial reasons. TikTok US should be much more\nexpensive this time, and Oracle's financial situation is much worse, having\n$87B in debt after some expensive acquisitions in 2021 and 2022. We don't find\nstrong statements of interest from them.\n\nAt a higher price, Microsoft or Amazon are the top contenders. Microsoft did\nput in a bid in 2020, so we consider them the most likely of the big tech\nfirms. Alphabet and Meta are struggling too much with antitrust to seriously\nconsider this, plus they might expect such purcahses to be blocked by the FTC.\n\nFrom public statements, a consortium led by Steve Mnuchin is the next most\nlikely:\n\nSteve Mnuchin has the unique background of being in the Trump cabinet during\nthe 2020 executive order to divest TikTok, while also having career experience\nin investment and M&A. Mnuchin is seeking an AI partner to \"rebuilt in the\nUS\", and he'll need to find investors. We see Snap or X as potential partners,\neven though their market caps might be lower than TikTok US, they could\nprovide some of the capital and some of the AI expertise.\n\n## Learn more\n\nLearn more here about the FutureSearch approach to answering these questions.\nYou can request beta access, or request a demo.\n\n## About\n\nA FutureSearch analysis of what will happen to TikTok after Biden signed the\nban on April 24, 2024\n\nfuturesearch.ai\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n1 star\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
