Satellite Data Helps Pinpoint Ocean Waves\n\n##\n\nImproved satellite-enabled buoys could make a splash in ocean science\n\nGwendolyn Rak\n\n22 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\nSensor-equipped buoys can easily be deployed with a toss overboard.\n\nYongsheng Xu\n\nclimate tech oceanography satellites climate change journal watch gnss\n\nThis article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership\nwith IEEE Xplore.\n\nOceanographers need precise measurements of waves and currents when studying\nthe seas. To collect this data, researchers turn to buoys equipped with\nsensors that can operate as floating field stations. The buoys are designed to\nmeasure the movement of water across the ocean surface, and the speed and size\nof ocean waves. To operate in the open sea, these buoys use GPS and other\nsatellite data in place of land-based reference points.\n\nDespite their usefulness, however, only a small number of these ocean wave\nbuoys have been deployed. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive and require complex\ncalculations to process the data, which are done with expensive onboard\ncomputational equipment and can take several days to complete.\n\nTo address these issues, a team of researchers in Qingdao, China has built a\nnew kind of buoy. Like other wave buoys, their technology uses global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology. But instead of gathering dual-\nfrequency satellite data\u2014the current standard\u2014their technology achieves lower\ncosts, better accuracy, and real-time computation with single-frequency\nanalysis. The researchers described their approach in a study published 19\nMarch in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.\n\nDual-frequency satellite data collects data in two separate frequency bands.\nIt is typically used to achieve more accurate measurements than data using a\nsingle frequency band; adding a second frequency band can correct for\ndisturbances in the atmosphere, though it takes longer to process.\n\nWhile satellite data alone can deliver some information about ocean dynamics\nfrom afar with remote sensing, it lacks the accuracy of direct observations.\nIn fact, GNSS buoys were initially developed as a calibration tool themselves,\nto improve satellite measurements of tides and global sea level change over a\nlong period of time, says study author Yongsheng Xusheng Xu, a researcher at\nthe Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and IEEE member.\nResearchers then realized they could use the buoys for measuring wave period,\nheight, and direction directly from the ocean. \u201cThe discovery that high-\nfrequency GNSS data also contains vital wave motion information... has\nextended the utility of these buoys beyond their initial purpose,\u201d Xu says.\n\n\u201cOnly with a sufficient number of observations can we better understand and\nforecast ocean waves.\u201d \u2014Yongsheng Xu, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nCurrent GNSS buoy designs take several different approaches to processing the\ndata. Some buoys calculate the buoy\u2019s vertical velocity from the Doppler\nshift, as measured by satellites overhead. Other methods examine acceleration\nfrom onboard the buoyand achieve precise measurements by including either a\nland-based reference station or downloading information about the satellite\u2019s\norbit and timing from its onboard clock, Xu says. However, this means that the\nbuoys have to be within 50 kilometers of the shore, in the case of a reference\nstation. Downloading extra satellite data adds a burden on the buoy\u2019s\nbandwidth and computational resources.\n\nThe researchers tested their buoys off the shore of Qingdao, China.Yongsheng\nXu\n\nThe Qingdao researchers\u2019 buoy takes the satellite-based principles, but uses a\nsingle-frequency GNSS chip\u2014a cheaper alternative to their dual-frequency\ncounterparts, which are currently used in the buoys. Switching to single-\nfrequency also showed slightly higher accuracy. The dual-frequency approach\ninvolves additional computation that can inadvertently amplify measurement\nerrors, Xu explains.\n\nIn the researchers\u2019 approach, an algorithm uses the single-frequency GPS\nsignal to measure the buoy\u2019s velocity in three dimensions, which is used to\nfind its displacement and therefore the size of the wave. While other methods\nrequire post-processing that can take several days\u2014sometimes up to a week\u2014this\napproach can be done in real-time and doesn\u2019t require external data downloads.\nCompared to the Doppler shift method\u2014the only other method that can be done in\nreal time\u2014the single-frequency method was five times as accurate in the\nresearchers\u2019 tests.\n\nThe single-frequency chips also cut down on costs; Xu estimates their buoy\ncosts about one-tenth the price of other wave buoys. Reducing the cost means\nscientists could deploy a large network of buoys, including off the shores of\nlower income countries. Scaling up the number will allow for better monitoring\nof waves across the globe, in line with the United Nations\u2019 goal to make the\n2020s an \u201cocean decade\u201d and increase attention on ocean science.\n\n\u201cOcean waves vary significantly in space and time,\u201d Xu says. \u201cOnly with a\nsufficient number of observations can we better understand and forecast ocean\nwaves.\u201c Reducing the cost of wave buoys could make this possible.\n\nThe researchers are currently working to address a key challenge: maintaining\nthe satellite link. The harsh sea conditions and stormy weather can affect the\nbuoys\u2019 ability to maintain a direct line of sight to receive the satellite\nradio signal, which are essential for the buoys to function, Xu says. The\nresearchers aim to improve the mechanical design of the buoys to address this\nin the future.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Wave Power On Its Way to Oregon Shores \u203a\n  * Wave Energy Tech Is Ready to Plug Into a Real Grid \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * National Data Buoy Center \u203a\n\nclimate techoceanographysatellitesclimate changejournal watchgnss\n\nGwendolyn Rak\n\nis a contributor to IEEE Spectrum.

Just before\nthe global pandemic, on an average day 12 million people flew on some 100,000\ncommercial flights, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization\n(ICAO). The numbers have now come roaring back: Industry revenues are expected\nto reach US $803 billion in 2023, 9.7 percent more than in 2022 and nearly up\nto the prepandemic peak, in 2019.\n\nWith increased air mobility comes more impact on the planet. Air traffic\ncontributes around 2 percent of worldwide carbon emissions. It also produces\ncontrails, which are being studied for their impact on climate change.
