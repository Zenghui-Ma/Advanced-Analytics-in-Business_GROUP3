For insiders. By insiders.\n\n  * RUSSO-UKRAINIAN WAR\n  * ABOUT\n  * SIGN IN\n  * BECOME A MEMBER\n\n# Solving the Houthi Threat to Freedom of Navigation\n\nAllison Minor\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nCommentary\n\nThe United States is engaged in its first major naval combat since World War\nII, according to the commander overseeing U.S. naval forces in the Middle\nEast. But instead of pitting the world\u2019s major powers against each other, this\nbattle is between a superpower and an isolated armed group controlling one of\nthe poorest, most resource-deprived areas on Earth.\n\nHouthi attacks on maritime shipping in the Red Sea are undermining freedom of\nnavigation as an international norm, jeopardizing a principle that has\nunderpinned the international system and global economy for decades. The fact\nthat the Houthi attacks have faded from the news cycle even while attacks\npersist and major shippers continue to boycott the Red Sea is evidence that a\n\u201cnew normal\u201d has set in, where freedom of navigation is no longer assumed.\n\nThis threat is unlikely to go away soon. The Houthis have many reasons to\ncontinue attacks in the Red Sea and potentially beyond even after a ceasefire\ntakes hold in Gaza, and the international response to date has proven\ninsufficient to deter them. A variety of non-state, rogue state, and other\nrevisionist actors are also taking note of how effectively Houthi attacks have\ndisrupted commerce.\n\nThe Houthi attacks and the international response are instructive,\ndemonstrating the difficulty of mobilizing a unified front in the current\ngeopolitical environment, even to address immediate threats to basic global\ngoods. But they also underscore that so-called \u201cnegative peace\u201d is not a real\nsolution to violent conflict. It is still possible to broker a more enduring\nsolution to the Houthi threat to freedom of navigation, thereby sending a\npositive signal about the resilience of the international system. A U.N.-led\npolitical process in Yemen provides the best path for addressing the factors\ninside Yemen motivating the Houthi attacks but that must be coupled with a\nunified, principled U.N. Security Council posture on the attacks. Yemen\nprovides a unique opportunity to demonstrate Security Council unity and\nability to act, if Gulf countries are willing and able to demonstrate\nleadership behind the scenes.\n\nBecome a Member\n\nWhat the International Response Says About the Current Geopolitical\nEnvironment\n\nThe difficulty mobilizing a strong, united international response to this\nthreat to freedom of navigation is cause for concern. The countries most\nimpacted by the Houthi attacks in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe have been\nhesitant to join the U.S.-led maritime coalition in the Red Sea, Operation\nProsperity Guardian, and only in part due to sensitivities over Gaza. Despite\nfacing both direct attacks and indirect economic consequences, China has\ndeclined to act. While hardly surprising given the status of U.S.-Chinese\nbilateral relations, it underscores that we are now in a world where the major\npowers are unwilling to work together to defend global goods, even when\nunrelated to major-power competition.\n\nAnti-internationalist trends may be making it more difficult to mobilize a\nunified approach even among U.S. allies in Europe. European publics and the\npoliticians they support are more skeptical about ceding control or resources\nto international bodies, which may have motivated decisions by major players\nlike France to keep naval resources in the Red Sea under national command. The\nresult has been a patchwork of efforts with the vast majority of work done by\nthe United States alone. And while that patchwork has successfully intercepted\nmany Houthi attacks, it has been insufficient to reassure commercial actors\nand restore major shipping activity in the Red Sea.\n\nWhy a Gaza Ceasefire May Not Be Enough\n\nRegional de-escalation of some sort is likely necessary to pause Houthi\nattacks in the near term, given genuine Houthi ideological motivations and the\nneed for them to publicly demonstrate that their attacks secured some benefit\nfor Palestinians. However, a Gaza ceasefire in isolation is not sufficient to\naddress the Houthi threat to freedom of navigation.\n\nThere is wide consensus among Yemen experts that Houthi attacks are driven\nonly in part by their support for Palestinians. A more powerful motivation for\nHouthi attacks is the need to distract from growing domestic dissent over\nHouthi governance since the April 2022 Yemen truce, and to bolster the\nHouthi\u2019s position both inside Yemen and within the region.\n\nYemen is in a transitional phase, what many Yemenis have called \u201cno war, no\npeace.\u201d The truce triggered a transition from a high-intensity civil and\nregional war to quiet talks around a political process. This is an\nuncomfortable limbo for the Houthis, who have only governed during wartime and\nlack access to Yemen\u2019s most valuable natural resources, namely oil and gas.\nU.N. estimates place the Houthis annual revenues at $1.8 billion \u2013 hardly\nenough to manage the more than 25 million Yemenis under their control. The\nHouthis spent years and countless lives trying to capture Yemen\u2019s oil and gas\nfields, to no avail. Maritime attacks provide a powerful new tool to help the\nHouthi\u2019s cement their control.\n\nThe Houthis may still frame attacks on shipping in the context of Gaza. It\u2019s a\nsimple, successful narrative and the path towards a solution in Gaza is a long\nand rocky one, at best. Even if the parties reach a ceasefire tomorrow, the\nHouthis could justify their attacks by protesting a continued Israeli security\npresence in Gaza or demanding guarantees of a Palestinian state, for example.\n\nHouthi statements have left plenty of space for continued attacks: Houthi\nleaders have said their attacks will continue until aggression in Gaza ceases,\nthe Gaza siege is lifted, and the situation is completely resolved. In Yemen,\nthe Houthis have defined siege as the lack of full, internationally recognized\nHouthi control over Yemen\u2019s ports of entry, even if basic goods enter\nunimpeded. By this definition, Gaza will likely be under siege for the\nforeseeable future.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nPrior to Oct. 7, the Houthis were pursuing a U.N.-backed political process\nthat would grant them access to additional economic resources and likely\neventually formalize Houthi control in northern Yemen. Amid Houthi attacks\nimpacting over a quarter of all U.N. member states, the future of this process\nis unclear.\n\nWith the political process stalled, the Houthis may renew their attempts to\nseize Yemen\u2019s oil and gas resources by force, leveraging the momentum created\nby their maritime attacks. The Houthis are already using the Red Sea attacks\nto launch significant conscription efforts, including of children. The Houthis\nmay also exploit Saudi and Emirati anxieties about renewed Houthi attacks on\ntheir territories. Such attacks could open a major new front in the broader\nMiddle East conflict. In particular, the Houthis could exploit these anxieties\nto ensure the Saudis and Emiratis do not provide their Yemeni allies the close\nair support that played an important role in repelling past Houthi offensives\non the oil and gas fields. While the Houthis may be able to capture those\nfields, the export infrastructure lies further south, in the heartland of\nformer South Yemen, where opposition against the Houthis is the strongest and\nthe United Arab Emirates has significant equities, opening the door for a new\nround of sustained conflict that could spread within the Gulf. In this way, a\nsuccessful Houthi offensive would remove one of the few remaining constraints\non Houthi power without providing a durable solution to the country\u2019s\ninstability, fostering precisely the kind of chaotic conditions likely to\nperpetuate Houthi attacks on maritime shipping.\n\nWhile some analysts have advocated for U.S. support for an offensive against\nthe Houthis, the conditions for such an offensive are even less conducive than\nin the past five years, when Saudi and Emirati-backed offensives repeatedly\nfailed to make meaningful progress. The last significant battlefield progress\nagainst the Houthis occurred in 2018, when the Houthis were substantially\nweaker and when the United Arab Emirates was willing to mobilize a significant\nEmirati troop presence on the ground, including a Emirati-led amphibious\nassault. It is difficult to imagine the United States or regional actors\nproviding such support now.\n\nUnfortunately, the problematic assumption that a Gaza ceasefire in isolation\ncan address the Houthi maritime threat undermines efforts to chart a more\ndurable solution. In addition to causing diplomats to de-prioritize dedicated\nefforts in Yemen, stark disagreements on Gaza combined with skepticism about\nthe path forward there incentivizes both regional actors and Russia and China\nto pursue individual arrangements that only further empower the Houthis. U.S.\npolicymakers also have a tendency to view Yemen through the lens of proximate\nforeign policy issues: first counterterrorism, then Iran, then Saudi Arabia,\nand now Gaza. This tendency has repeatedly generated only partial solutions\nthat invariably breed new threats.\n\nA Chance to Show the International System Still Works\n\nThere is an alternative to a failed state scenario. While imperfect, a\nU.N.-backed political process provides the most significant form of\ninternational leverage over the Houthis. If executed effectively, it has the\npotential to enforce Houthi compromise with other Yemeni political actors.\nMost importantly, it could provide the conditions necessary for an economic\nrecovery that fosters economic cooperation with Yemen\u2019s wealthy neighbors.\nSuch a recovery process would provide powerful incentives discouraging renewed\nHouthi use of force in the region.\n\nBut a political process can only realize this potential if it is coupled with\na unified, principled international stance on Houthi attacks on maritime\nshipping. Absent this, the Houthis could use the threat of attacks to extract\nprogressively greater concessions, simultaneously isolating Yemen and\ndepriving it of the international economic support necessary for recovery. For\nthis to work, the entire U.N. Security Council would need to quietly but\nclearly articulate red lines for Houthi attacks and be willing to uphold them.\nThis means inflicting meaningful consequences if the Houthis fail to uphold\ntheir commitments. A political process will expand the levers available to the\nSecurity Council, including through their ability to set terms for lifting the\nChapter VII provisions against the Houthis. A political process that gradually\nlegitimizes the Houthis is understandably unattractive to many U.S.\npolicymakers, but it also presents the most viable path for addressing the\nunderlying factors that triggered the Houthi attacks and shifting incentives\naway from continued use of force.\n\nA unified Security Council posture on the Houthi attacks may seem unattainable\nin the current geopolitical environment, especially given Houthi attempts to\nreassure China and Russia and thereby divide the Security Council. But these\nreassurances have fallen somewhat flat given that Russian and Chinese-\naffiliated ships have both come under Houthi attack, and the inevitable\neconomic impacts of Houthi maritime attacks on China. More importantly, Yemen\nhas been a rare example of relative Security Council unity in the past. It was\none of the few cases where the United Nations has been able to adopt new\nsanctions in recent years, even after Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine inflamed\ndivisions in the Security Council on the issue. Key to this unity has been the\nwillingness of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help corral\nChinese and Russian cooperation and a consensus that continued conflict in the\nArab Gulf is counterproductive. Neither China nor Russia has major equities in\nYemen, unlike other regional hotspots like Syria and Libya. But China and\nRussia both rely heavily on their relationships with Saudi Arabia and the\nUnited Arab Emirates, whose equities in Yemen are significant. As a result,\nChina and Russia have repeatedly prioritized requests from the Saudis and\nEmiratis related to Yemen over their tensions with the United States in the\nSecurity Council, or their hesitancy over sanctions. The fact that the\nSecurity Council was able to pass a resolution condemning the Houthi attacks\nin the Red Sea in January despite strong Council disagreement on the broader\nsituation in the Middle East is itself evidence of this relative unity. While\nRussia and China abstained on the resolution, they declined to veto it,\nthereby allowing it to go forward. This decision was likely motivated by their\neconomic equities in the Red Sea, combined with quiet diplomatic engagement\nfrom regional actors.\n\nA stronger, unified Security Council approach to the Houthi attacks would need\nto begin with Saudi Arabia, with support from the Emiratis. Saudi Arabia\u2019s\ncautious public stance on the attacks is understandable given the\nsensitivities of the situation in Gaza. But Saudi Arabia understands that the\nHouthi maritime threat is not limited to the current Gaza conflict. Saudi\nArabia must make it clear to the Houthis that they will not engage in a side\ndeal that jeopardizes the U.N.-led political process or enables the Houthis to\nseize Yemen\u2019s oil and gas fields. This approach is ultimately in Saudi\nArabia\u2019s interest, so that they do not find themselves footing the entire bill\nfor what are sure to become escalating Houthi demands. Saudi Arabia must then\nwork closely with Security Council members to chart a consensus posture on the\nHouthi maritime attacks, including how that posture aligns with a U.N.-led\npolitical process. If Saudi Arabia were to present the Russians and the\nChinese with such a proposal \u2014 including previously agreed consequences for\nHouthi violations \u2014 it would be difficult for them to disagree, and the\nSecurity Council could minimize the bartering and uncertainty that typically\ndelays or impedes its ability to actually deploy consequences. All of this can\nbe done behind closed doors to maximize diplomatic space. Such a proposal\nwould provide a unifying vision for the path forward in Yemen, even if\nprogress in the short term requires further regional de-escalation.\n\nIn addition to providing a more durable solution to the Houthi threat to\nfreedom of navigation, this approach would send a positive message about the\nintegrity of the international system. If major powers are still capable of\ncoming together to uphold global goods, Yemen provides a compelling case for\ndoing so.\n\nBecome a Member\n\nAllison Minor is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.
