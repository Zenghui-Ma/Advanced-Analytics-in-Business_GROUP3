Physically impeding other employees\u2019 work and preventing them from\naccessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely\nunacceptable behavior. After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises,\nlaw enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety,\" the\nstatement said.\n\n\"We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the\ntermination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate\nand take action as needed,\" it added.\n\nThe protests were led by No Tech for Apartheid, a group of tech workers who\nhave been demanding Amazon and Google drop their Project Nimbus, which is a\njoint $1.2 billion contract providing the Israeli government and military with\ncloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence services and data centers.\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid said Google had fired the employees \u201cindiscriminately\u201d\nand the workers had engaged in a \u201cpeaceful sit-in and refusing to leave did\nnot damage property or threaten other workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis excuse to avoid confronting us and our concerns directly, and attempt to\njustify its illegal, retaliatory firings, is a lie,\u201d it said in a statement\nlate Wednesday, accusing the company of valuing its contract with the Israeli\ngovernment more than its employees.\n\nGoogle employees protests at the company offices in Sunnyvale, Calif., in an\nimage posted to social media on Wednesday.@notechforapartheir via Instagram\n\nGoogle issued a stern warning to its employees, with the company\u2019s vice\npresident of global security, Chris Rackow, saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the few\nwho are tempted to think we\u2019re going to overlook conduct that violates our\npolicies, think again,\u201d according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC.\n\nThe company also said that its work \"is not directed at highly sensitive,\nclassified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence\nservices.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle Cloud supports numerous governments around the world in countries\nwhere we operate, including the Israeli government, with our generally\navailable cloud computing services,\u201d a Google spokesperson told CNBC on\nWednesday evening.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister's office and Israel Defense Forces did not\nimmediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.\n\nThe workers were also protesting labor conditions at the company \u2014 saying the\ncontract was impacting \u201chealth and safety on the job\u201d \u2014 and what they said was\nGoogle\u2019s disregard \u201cfor the well-being of our Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim\ncolleagues facing Google-enabled racism, discrimination, harassment, and\ncensorship.\u201d\n\nThe project has become a \u201cmajor health & safety workplace conditions issue,\u201d\nwith many employees quitting after citing \u201cmental health consequences of\nworking at a company that is using their labor to enable a genocide,\u201d the\ngroup said in a statement posted on Medium on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOn a personal level, I am opposed to Google taking any military contracts \u2014\nno matter which government they\u2019re with or what exactly the contract is\nabout,\u201d Cheyne Anderson, a Google Cloud software engineer based in Washington,\ntold CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nAnderson was one of the nine workers arrested across the country on Tuesday,\nwith some of those arrests streamed live on Twitch.\n\nFour people were arrested for \u201ctrespassing\u201d inside Google\u2019s New York Office, a\nspokesperson for the New York Police told NBC News on Wednesday. Almost 50\nprotesters had taken part in the demonstration, the spokesperson said.\n\nMithil Aggarwal\n\nMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.\n\nDiana Dasrath contributed.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
