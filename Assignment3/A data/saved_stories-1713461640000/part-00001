It\u2019s a peer\nlanguage to SQL and the first new ISO database language since 1987 \u2014 when the\nfirst version of SQL was released.\n\n> This is a really big deal.\n\nThe GQL standard is for and about graphs. Graphs are a way of working with\ndata that you already have. They excel with exactly the type of data that the\nworld is creating more of, building applications around, and increasingly\nfinding ourselves needing to analyze and make sense of.\n\nExample of a graph visualization\n\nDatabase management systems (DBMSs) that work with your data as a graph are\ncalled graph databases. The ISO GQL (Graph Query Language) standard uses a\nparticular type of graph called a property graph. Its design dates back over\ntwo decades, and it has gained significant popularity in recent years across a\nwide range of applications \u2013 spanning a multitude of use cases in just about\nevery industry.\n\nHaving an international standard for graph databases adds immense value to a\nlandscape where data is increasingly dynamic and interconnected. That ISO has\ninvested more than five years in creating this standard says something about\nthe importance of this technology.\n\n### Why Graphs, Why Now?\n\nStandards channel trends. Graph databases are increasingly used by a wide\nvariety of organizations to solve all kinds of problems. Just this year,\nGartner placed knowledge graphs, something for which graph databases are\npurpose-built, at the center of their 2024 Technology Impact Radar (which\nranks the 30 most impactful technologies) and their 2024 Impact Radar for\nGenAI. Neo4j, the leading but very much not the only player in this rapidly\nexpanding space, has amassed the majority of the Global 2000s, countless\nstartups, and major governments as users and customers.\n\nGraphs solve real-world high-value problems that otherwise defy solving, both\nthe operational database world and the world of analytics and AI.\n\n### Power of Standards\n\nStandards shape industries. They are where innovation crystallizes into common\nmethods and patterns that can be applied to solve large-scale problems in the\nreal world.\n\nStandards are a friend to the CIO, the developer, and the ecosystem alike. For\nCIOs, they are the best antidote to vendor lock-in and guarantee access to a\nlarge pool of common skills. For developers, they avoid needing to learn new\ntechnologies while shuttling between projects and products. And for the\necosystem, they provide clear integration patterns that amplify the value and\nreach of technology investments. All three are protection against\nobsolescence.\n\nWhat does this mean for graphs? One obvious takeaway is that graph databases\nhave now earned their place in the information technology mainstream alongside\ntraditional databases. This is a good cause for re-evaluating what graph\ndatabases can do for one\u2019s organization today.\n\nWhat\u2019s probably not as obvious for many readers is how perfect the timing is.\nGenAI is a crashing wave that is further accelerating digital transformation.\nThe same things that make graph databases peerless at modeling connected real-\nand digital-world systems (such as smart cities, payment networks, supply\nchains, biological systems, asset ownership chains, computer networks, etc.)\nalso make them invaluable for GenAI.\n\nIn a world where LLMs provide a cornucopia of value and surprises in what\namounts to right-brain behavior for AI, AI engineers at the leading edge of\ntheir field are discovering that graph databases can play the essential role\nof the left brain. This is not a small thing in a world where most problems\ncan almost certainly benefit from having the power of both hemispheres.\n\nMuch has been written about this last topic, and I look forward to covering it\nin greater detail in a separate post.\n\n### What Does GQL Look Like?\n\nAs a peer, complementary language to SQL that originates from the same\norganization and committee as the one behind SQL, it won\u2019t surprise you to\nlearn that GQL resembles SQL in many ways. Both languages share the same data\ntypes, and many of the same keywords and commands are the same.\n\nOf course, GQL also includes parts that cater specifically to the unique\naspects of graph databases. The absolute core of the language is the ASCII-\nart-inspired way of defining patterns. A few graph database languages share\nthis, and it traces its way back to 2010 with Neo4j\u2019s Cypher language, which,\nthrough the openCypher project, has become the de facto standard graph query\nlanguage used by Neo4j, AWS Neptune, and numerous others.\n\n### Path to GQL\n\nIn the world of graphs, there can be many ways to reach a destination. Often,\nthe shortest path can be made clear. Such is the case with GQL. There is much\nmore to be said about this \u2013 and it will be the subject of future posts. But\nthe short answer is that the shortest path to GQL is Cypher, which most people\nalready use.\n\nThere are several reasons for this:\n\nFirst, Cypher was a major input into GQL. And as inputs go, it was of\nespecially high quality. By the time the standards work kicked off in 2019,\nCypher had already undergone nearly a decade of real-world trial-by-fire\nmaturation.\n\nSecond, Cypher itself was originally modeled after SQL. The \u201cno idle variance\nfrom SQL\u201d principle that drove Cypher\u2019s development from the start turned out\nto be prescient. In the early days of Cypher, no one would have imagined that\nit would become a significant input to an ISO standard \u2013 let alone on a\nconvergence course. But the principle made sense. Why invent something new to\ndo something people are already used to doing?\n\nThere is one more reason: the team behind Cypher and openCypher has been\ndeeply involved in developing the GQL standard. Around half a dozen Neo4j\nengineers collaborated with numerous others throughout the roughly five years\nit took to produce GQL, joining up as full-time standards committee members.\nAs aspects of the GQL standard crystallized, Cypher itself was made to align\nwith the forthcoming standard. The roads were smoothed in anticipation of GQL.\n\nAs a result, today\u2019s Cypher is already highly aligned with GQL. New and\nexisting graph database users alike can benefit from a clear path to adoption\nand a smooth path to GQL. Sticking with Cypher will land you straight into GQL\nas it completes the last few steps of its convergence course. So, if you got\nworried and brought out your forklift when you first saw this post, you can\nnow put it away!\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nThis is a massive milestone for the database industry, one whose impact will\nbe felt over years and decades, not just months. Standards, after all, are\nmeant as a foundation for enduring technologies and are reserved for only the\nmost important trends.\n\nWe\u2019re excited about the possibilities and look forward to seeing what\ninnovation and disruption you will all create in your respective spaces thanks\nto graphs \u2013 now with GQL at your backs!\n\nNeo4j\u2019s fully managed cloud service\u2014 now free!\n\nLearn More \u203a\n\n### GraphAcademy\n\nFree online courses & certifications.
