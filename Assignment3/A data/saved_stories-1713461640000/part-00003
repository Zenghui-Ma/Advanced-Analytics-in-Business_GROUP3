The CPU single-threaded rating\nis a crucial metric as it is the most significant factor (unless your job is\nmassively parallel) in accelerating any of your workflows.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that x64 and arm64 CPU speed numbers are not directly\ncomparable. By exploring the tables below, you can gain a better understanding\nof the performance of various GitHub Action runner providers and make an\ninformed decision for your projects.\n\nNote: for RunsOn, you can view the on-demand, spot pricing, and spot\ninterruption percentages, on the Benchmarks - AWS EC2 Instances page.\n\n## Results\n\n### x64 runners\n\nProvider| Processor| Samples| CPU speed (avg | p95)| Queue time (s) (avg | p95)| Infra  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nRunsOn\n\n  * runs-on,family=c7a\n\n| AMD EPYC 9R14 (x86_64)| 38| 2871 | 2904| 34 | 45| Amazon.com  \nRunsOn\n\n  * runs-on,family=r7iz\n\n| Intel Xeon Gold 6455B (x86_64)| 33| 3151 | 3156| 34 | 45| Amazon.com  \nRunsOn\n\n  * runs-on,family=m7i-flex\n\n| Intel Xeon Platinum 8488C (x86_64)| 37| 2850 | 2974| 33 | 45| Amazon.com  \nBuildjet\n\n  * buildjet-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204\n  * buildjet-16vcpu-ubuntu-2204\n\n| AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor (x86_64)| 78| 2786 | 2977| 30 | 34| Hetzner Online  \nBuildjet\n\n  * buildjet-16vcpu-ubuntu-2204\n  * buildjet-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204\n\n| AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D 16-Core Processor (x86_64)| 48| 3834 | 4048| 28 | 33| Hetzner Online  \nWarpbuild\n\n  * warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-2x\n\n| AMD EPYC 7B13 (x86_64)| 84| 2377 | 2389| 21 | 47| Google Cloud  \nWarpbuild\n\n  * warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-16x\n\n| AMD EPYC 9B14 (x86_64)| 42| 2699 | 2703| 17 | 38| Google Cloud  \nUbicloud\n\n  * ubicloud-standard-2\n  * ubicloud-standard-16\n\n| AMD EPYC 7502P 32-Core Processor (x86_64)| 85| 2005 | 2030| 39 | 69| Hetzner Online  \nUbicloud\n\n  * ubicloud-standard-2\n  * ubicloud-standard-16\n\n| AMD EPYC 9454P 48-Core Processor (x86_64)| 38| 2581 | 2600| 39 | 89| Hetzner Online  \nGitHub\n\n  * github-16cpu\n  * ubuntu-latest\n\n| AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core Processor (x86_64)| 81| 2352 | 2403| 11 | 14| Microsoft Azure  \n  \n### arm64 runners\n\nProvider| Processor| Samples| CPU speed (avg | p95)| Queue time (s) (avg | p95)| Infra  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nRunsOn\n\n  * runs-on,family=m7g\n\n| (aarch64)| 30| 1520 | 1552| 32 | 42| Amazon.com  \nBuildjet\n\n  * buildjet-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204-arm\n\n| Neoverse-N1 (aarch64)| 35| 1320 | 1325| 35 | 37| Hetzner Online  \nUbicloud\n\n  * ubicloud-standard-2-arm\n\n| Neoverse-N1 (aarch64)| 35| 1318 | 1322| 37 | 93| Hetzner Online  \nWarpbuild\n\n  * warp-ubuntu-latest-arm64-2x\n\n| Neoverse-N1 (aarch64)| 24| 1310 | 1316| 13 | 14| Google Cloud  \n  \n## Analysis\n\nRunsOn is a special case, since it is the only fully on-premise solution from\nthe benchmark. It has the fastest CPU speed for ARM64, and CPU speeds for x64\nare better than all other providers, except Buildjet when you get to end on\none of their fastest runners. Boot times are regularly improving and now\nbetter than some of the other SaaS providers (although everything is launched\non-demand and not from warm pools). If you combine the very good CPU speed +\nup to 10x lower cost + full on-premise deployment, it is one of the best all-\naround solutions currently on the market for GitHub Action runners.\n\nBuildjet does have some faster CPUs in their inventory, but at this time the\nassignment is very random. Irrespective of whether you ask for 2cpu or larger\nrunners. Boot times are just average for a SaaS.\n\nWarpbuild have consistent and fast boot times for x64 and ARM64. Not the\nfastest machines around though.\n\nUbicloud has very variable boot times, and slow instances. They are the only\nSaaS boasting 10x cheaper prices though.\n\n## When to use GitHub Action official runners\n\nThe adage that says that GitHub Action is where older Azure hardware gets to\ndie seems to be true, with the default Ubuntu runners having abysmal single-\nspeed CPU performance. They are not without their use though, because they\nboot fast, and are ideal for short-lived jobs or those that do not require\nfast CPUs.\n\nAs a user of RunsOn, we always advise to keep using official GitHub runners\nfor short-lived jobs, unless you have so many that the bill starts to be too\nhigh. This is because RunsOn runners currently take around 30s to start\nprocessing workflows, vs 5-20s for GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners.\n\nWe strongly discourage the use of the larger GitHub runners though, because\nthey can take up to a few minutes to boot, are not very fast, and cost $$$.\n\n## About those benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks are performed using the Passmark benchmarking tool \u2197, using the CPU\nSingle Threaded metric.\n\nThe table displays the last 30 days of data, before the last updated date.\n\nLast updated: Thu Apr 18 2024.\n\nPrevious Upgrade Guide Next Benchmarks - AWS EC2 Instances\n\n", "frontpage": false}
