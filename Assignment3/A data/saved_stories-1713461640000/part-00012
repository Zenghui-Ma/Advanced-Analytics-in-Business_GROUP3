Twelve months on, it looks like \u201ctax\nwrite-off\u201d might have been the right answer.\n\nThis year was not just the year that cryptocurrency values were burned by\ninvestor fears, rising interest rates, inflation and scandals, it was the year\nthat crypto\u2019s cartoonish art cousin the NFT \u2013 an electronic identifier\nconfirming a digital collectible is real \u2013 collided with reality.\n\nFederal court bars Australian company from releasing unsanctioned Pok\u00e9mon-\nbranded NFTs\n\nRead more\n\nIn March 2021, Christie\u2019s sold a digital collage NFT by the artist Beeple for\nnearly $70m (\u00a358m). In January pop star Justin Bieber paid $1.29m (\u00a31m) for a\n\u201cBored Ape\u201d NFT, a graphic of a, well, bored ape. Everyone from Michael Jordan\nto former first lady Melania Trump was in on the game.\n\nNow \u2013 alongside the broader crypto market \u2013 the appetite for NFTs is so\ndiminished that a specialized market has sprung up for collectors looking to\nsell off their once-valuable \u201cdigital collectibles\u201d as tax losses to offset\ntheir income tax bills.\n\nA recently launched service, Unsellable, aims to help collectors do exactly\nthat. Think of it as a distressed asset fire sale.\n\n\u201cWhile every investment class has its losers, many of the NFTs we invested in\nwere not only down big; they were now totally worthless ... illiquid ...\nunsellable,\u201d the service says on its website.\n\nUnsellable \u2013 which says it is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s largest collection of\nworthless NFTs\u201d \u2013 buys the underlying tokens for a fraction of their original\nprice and provides an official receipt for tax purposes.\n\nLaunched a month ago, Unsellable now has 5,000 NFTs, and founder Skyler\nHallgren expects that to grow to 15,000 by the end of the month. \u201cThey are an\ninteresting artefact of a period of time in the market,\u201d he said. But he\nexpects the NFTs are \u201clikely to continue to be worthless\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe realized there was a practical problem that was locking up a lot of\nresources and we could create a lot of value for people by offering to buy up\ntheir worthless NFTs and allow them to harvest the losses,\u201d said Hallgren.\n\n\u201cFor some folks, the amount they paid for NFTs is quite high and were buying\nthem for a penny so the write-off they can take is quite high.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why buyers may be keen to sell for a fraction of their\noriginal investment. Demand for digital certificates of ownership that\nunderlie NFTs has evaporated. More than $19bn (\u00a316bn) was spent on NFTs\nbetween January and March 2022. Since then, according to blockchain analysis\nfirm Chainalysis, monthly spending has dropped by 87%.\n\nJust $442m (\u00a3368m) was spent in November, and the number of active NFT traders\nis down around two-thirds from its peak a year ago. According to the\nNonfungible.com market tracker, 144,000 NFTs were sold for $142m (\u00a3118m) on 16\nJanuary 2022. This Wednesday, there were 17,000 sales for $28,000 (\u00a323,294).\n\nThe most traded collection of NFTs are images from the Bored Ape Yacht Club\n(BAYC), like the one Bieber bought. Each Bored Ape image features a unique\ncombination of 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing\nand more. \u201cAll apes are dope, but some are rarer than others,\u201d the company\nsays.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

The lawsuit named celebrities \u2013 and former NFT evangelists \u2013 including\nBieber, Paris Hilton, Madonna, Jimmy Fallon and Kevin Hart, as co-defendants.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 promotional campaign was wildly successful, generating billions\nof dollars in sales and re-sales,\u201d the lawsuit, filed on 8 December in a\ndistrict court in California, said.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s digital trading card collection sells out in less than a day\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cThe manufactured celebrity endorsements and misleading promotions regarding\nthe launch of an entire BAYC ecosystem (the so-called Otherside metaverse)\nwere able to artificially increase the interest in and price of the BAYC NFTs\nduring the relevant period, causing investors to purchase these losing\ninvestments at drastically inflated prices.\u201d\n\nThe NFT market is a long way from where it sat in October 2021, when Mike\nWinkelmann \u2013 the digital artist known as Beeple \u2013 sold his work at Christie\u2019s,\nmaking him \u201camong the top three most valuable living artists\u201d.\n\nLast week, Winkelmann remained upbeat about the internet\u2019s place in creating\nart, but he conceded: \u201cThe market is a bit crap right now,\u201d he told Bloomberg.\n\u201cDo I think it\u2019s going to go back to where it was? I don\u2019t know ... I\ndefinitely think it\u2019s going to go up from here.\u201d\n\nAnd one former celebrity, and US president, agrees. Earlier this month, Donald\nTrump launched a collection of digital collectibles depicting him as, among\nother things, an astronaut, a cowboy and a superhero. It sold out in less than\na day.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n  * Cryptocurrencies\n  * Fintech\n  * Technology sector\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
