So let\u2019s skip the\nintro and get straight into the updates, yeah?\n\n### Updates to Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS\n\nWhile Pop!_OS technically follows Ubuntu\u2019s release cycle, we keep the core\ntechnologies updated on a semi-rolling release basis. This month, the official\nrelease of Pop!_OS has been updated with version 6.8.0 of the Linux kernel,\nwhich includes driver support for Intel Xe and Intel Arc graphics, as well as\ndrivers for a future AMD Zen 5 chipset and additional networking\noptimizations.\n\nAs a result, systems like the new Lemur Pro running Pop!_OS now support\nIntel\u2019s new line of Core Ultra Series processors. Meanwhile, Phoronix\nbenchmark testing on the Thelio Major with AMD Ryzen Treadripper 7980X\nrevealed a significant performance boost over the 6.6.6 kernel.\n\nKernel 6.8.2 is currently in testing along with Mesa 24.0.3, and both will be\nreleased when ready! The new Mesa driver implements new Vulkan and OpenGL\nAPIs, keeping Pop!_OS current with the best Linux gaming experiences\navailable.\n\n### Updates to the COSMIC Pre-Alpha\n\n##### Theming\n\nTheming support has been added for apps built with GTK (both GTK 3 & GTK 4),\nas well as apps packaged in flatpak. Custom themes will be applied to GTK\napplications if the global theme option is enabled by the user, which can be\nturned on in the Appearance settings.\n\nA custom COSMIC theme is dynamically applied to GTK3 and GTK4 applications.\n\nCustom icon themes have also been implemented, which will apply both to COSMIC\nand GTK applications.\n\nThe COSMIC icon theme was changed to Humanity, as evidenced by the orange\nicons in COSMIC Files. This is also applied to GTK applications.\n\nLabeling has also been implemented for cycling between Light Mode and Dark\nMode based on the time of day.\n\n##### New COSMIC App Store\n\nWe\u2019re building a new app store for COSMIC. Keeping with designs for COSMIC\napps, the COSMIC App Store features a sidebar for exploring featured\napplications, browsing applications by category, managing installed apps, and\nperforming updates.\n\nA list of applications with updates available, seen in the new COSMIC App\nStore. This Updates page can be selected in the sidebar.\n\n##### Simplified Window Movement\n\nDragging your cursor to a window\u2019s title bar to move it takes an unneeded\nlevel of precision. To maintain focus \u2014 as well as comfort on trackpads \u2014\nsimply clicking any region of a window while holding Super will allow dragging\nit to your preferred location and quickly get back to your important task.\n\n##### COSMIC Settings\n\nThe Keyboard settings page has been implemented! This enables adding and\nreordering the session\u2019s keyboard input sources, such as language-specific\nlayouts, regional layouts, or alternative layouts like DVORAK. Furthermore,\ninputting special characters is also supported via an alternate character key\n(ex. Left Alt + C to type \u201c\u0107\u201d) or compose key (ex. Right Alt, then S to type\n\u201c\u015b\u201d. Keyboard shortcuts are currently in progress.\n\nKeyboard input sources are being searched, with Polish keyboard options being\ndisplayed when searching \u201cPol\u201d.\n\nContext drawers now display selections for the alternate characters and\ncompose keys. Here, Caps Lock is selected as the alternate character key.\n\nThe system\u2019s device name is now editable in the About settings page, using a\nnew editable text input widget in libcosmic.\n\nThe device name on this system was changed to \u201cPop-Dev-One.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the ability to reset Dock and Panel Settings to default has also\nbeen added.\n\n##### Power State Alerts\n\nSounds and notifications have been added for low battery, critically low\nbattery, and plugging/unplugging the charger.\n\n##### On-Screen Displays\n\nOSD implementations for adjustments to brightness, volume, and airplane mode\nare now complete!\n\n##### COSMIC Apps\n\nImplementation is still underway for COSMIC Edit, Terminal, and Files. These\napps allow us to test the COSMIC development experience, add libcosmic\nwidgets, and fine-tune the design system.\n\n##### Third Party Contributions\n\nThe COSMIC community has been kicking space-themed tuchus with their work!\nRyanabx\n\nworked on touchpad gestures for switching workspaces, thumbnail previews for\nopen windows in the dock, as well as quick-snap window maximizing and tiling\nwhen you drag a window to the outer edge of the screen. This includes half-\ntiles and quarter-tiles.\n\nThis user clicked the Firefox icon in their dock, which triggered previews to\nappear of their 3 open windows. These previews include a thumbnail image and\nbrief title for each open window.\n\nWhen a window is dragged to the edge of the screen, a hint will indicate how\nthe window will be drawn after releasing the mouse.\n\nIn this case, the window was dragged to the right edge, and was then laid out\nin a vertical half-tile arranged in the right half of the screen.\n\nMeanwhile, Edfloreshz created a COSMIC Tasks app for creating to-do lists and\ntracking progress. This project allowed us to make some vital additions to the\nlibcosmic widget library, and we provided some contributions of our own. The\nauthor has created a website for it here.\n\nA shopping list is displayed in a checklist layout in the COSMIC Tasks app.\n\nEdfloreshz has also created an ongoing list of third party COSMIC projects in\nthe works, including a clipboard manager and fan-control GUI by wiiznokes. Not\nyet added to this list is this emoji selector built by leb-kuchen.\n\n##### Compositor Updates\n\n  * The compositor (cosmic-comp) saw a number of fixes to Xwayland.\n  * NVIDIA fixes with the addition of the new linux-drm-syncobj-v1 Wayland protocol, to be applied with the next NVIDIA 555 driver.\n  * More reliable screen capture with the implementation of cosmic-screencopy-v2 (also removes obstacles from cosmic-workspaces development)\n  * Support added for keyboard LEDs, such as a Caps Lock indicator\n  * Touchscreen improvements\n  * Drag and resize windows with touch\n\n##### Additional Fixes & Improvements\n\n  * COSMIC applets are now compiled as a multicall binary, which increased performance and reduced disk usage by 115 MB\n  * Drag & drop support was implemented in iced, libcosmic, and COSMIC Files\n  * Middle-clicking an application in the app list opens a new window\n\n##### Preliminary performance comparisons\n\nThough there\u2019s plenty of optimization left to be done, we wanted to see how\nthe Pop!_OS COSMIC pre-alpha compared to Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS. So far, benchmark\ntests in Unigine Superposition and Cyberpunk 2077 with both AMD and NVIDIA\ngraphics has seen a within 1% FPS difference between the two sessions.\n\nPop!_OS COSMIC was tested against Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, on the System76 Thelio\nwith AMD Radeon 6600 XT, as well as the System76 Thelio Spark with NVIDIA 3060\nTi graphics. In Cyberpunk 2077, the two scored within <1 FPS of the other on\nboth desktops.\n\n## COSMIC at LFNW\n\nA reminder that System76 CEO Carl Richell and UX Architect Maria Komarova will\nbe at LinuxFest Northwest this year to showcase COSMIC DE. Hosted at\nBellingham Technical College in Washington state, the conference features\nexhibits and events featuring organizations across Linux, open source,\nInfoSec, and privacy.\n\nThe talk takes place on Saturday, April 27th at 11a.m. PDT. We\u2019ll see you\nthere!\n\n# Like what you see?\n\n## Share on Social Media\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 System76, Inc.\n\nIntel, the Intel Logo, Intel Core, Iris, and Xeon are trademarks of Intel\nCorporation or its subsidiaries in the U.S. and/or other countries.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
