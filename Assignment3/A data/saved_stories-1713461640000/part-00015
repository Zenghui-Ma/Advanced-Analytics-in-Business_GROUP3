This\nreview synthesizes the breadth of these interwoven emergencies and underscores\nthe urgent need for comprehensive, integrated action. Propelled by\nimperialism, extractive capitalism, and a surging population, we are speeding\npast Earth's material limits, destroying critical ecosystems, and triggering\nirreversible changes in biophysical systems that underpin the Holocene\nclimatic stability which fostered human civilization. The consequences of\nthese actions are disproportionately borne by vulnerable populations, further\nentrenching global inequities. Marine and terrestrial biomes face critical\ntipping points, while escalating challenges to food and water access\nforeshadow a bleak outlook for global security. Against this backdrop of Earth\nat risk, we call for a global response centered on urgent decarbonization,\nfostering reciprocity with nature, and implementing regenerative practices in\nnatural resource management. We call for the elimination of detrimental\nsubsidies, promotion of equitable human development, and transformative\nfinancial support for lower income nations. A critical paradigm shift must\noccur that replaces exploitative, wealth-oriented capitalism with an economic\nmodel that prioritizes sustainability, resilience, and justice. We advocate a\nglobal cultural shift that elevates kinship with nature and communal well-\nbeing, underpinned by the recognition of Earth\u2019s finite resources and the\ninterconnectedness of its inhabitants. The imperative is clear: to navigate\naway from this precipice, we must collectively harness political will,\neconomic resources, and societal values to steer toward a future where human\nprogress does not come at the cost of ecological integrity and social equity.\n\nenvironmental policy, global economics, climate change, biodiversity loss,\nsocioeconomic inequality\n\nSubject\n\nSustainability Science (Physical Sciences and Engineering) Sustainability\nScience (Social and Political Sciences)\n\nIssue Section:\n\nReview\n\nEditor: Junguo Liu\n\nJunguo Liu\n\nEditor\n\nSearch for other works by this author on:\n\nOxford Academic\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\n## Climate change and global sustainability\n\nIt is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere (1) and the\nclimate crisis is now well underway. Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions set\na new record in 2023 (2), rising an estimated 1.1%, the third annual increase\nin a row since the COVID-19 recession. With a record 1.45 \u00b1 0.12\u00b0C of\nanthropogenic global heating reached in 2023 (3), we already see nearly one-\nthird of the world population exposed to deadly heat waves (4), a 9-fold\nincrease in large North American wildfires (5), record-setting regional-scale\nmegadrought (6), the Antarctic ice sheet losing nearly 75% more ice between\n2011 and 2020 than it did for the period 2001 and 2010 (7), animal and plant\nextinctions projected to increase 2- to 5-fold in coming decades (8),\ndeepening genetic diversity loss (9), and a weakened global ecosystem (10)\npushed to its breaking point (11).\n\nScientists suspect the last several years have been warmer than any point in\nmore than 125,000 years (12). Yet demand for oil climbed to over 100 million\nbarrels per day in 2023, the highest in history (13). Despite decades of\nglobal investment in clean energy (14), fossil fuels still provide over 80% of\nglobal energy use (15), a figure that has not changed for decades. In the\nabsence of climate action, our world is on course (16) to heat a blistering\n3\u00b0C, perhaps more (17), potentially displacing one-third of humanity (18).\n\nOne study (19) suggests that \u223c9% of people (>600 million) already live outside\nthe human climate \u201cniche.\u201d Another concludes that, compared with people born\nin 1960, children born today will experience 7.5 times as many heatwaves, 3.6\ntimes as many droughts, 3 times as many crop failures, 2.8 times as many river\nfloods, and 2 times as many wildfires (20). Studies (21) forecast climate-\nrelated extinction of 14\u201332% of macroscopic species in the next \u223c50 years,\nincluding 3\u20136 million animal and plant species, even under intermediate\nclimate change scenarios. With continued warming, the frequency of wildfires\nwill increase over 74% of the global landmass by the end of this century (22).\nSuch assessments are conservative as they are based on projections from\nclimate models that may not capture some important processes through which\nhuman-caused heating amplifies persistent weather extremes (23, 24).\n\nOf the 40 leading economies, all of which agreed in the 2015 Paris Climate\nAccord to take all necessary actions to stop global heating below 1.5\u00b0C, not\none nation is on track to do what they promised (25). Globally, current\nclimate policies are incompatible with limiting global heating to 1.5\u00b0C (26).\nThe remaining budget for a 50% chance of keeping warming to 1.5\u00b0C is\napproximately 250 GtCO_2 as of January 2023, now equal to around 6 years of\ncurrent emissions (27). The energy plans of countries responsible for the\nlargest GHG emissions would lead to 460% more coal production, 83% more\nnatural gas, and 29% more oil in 2030 than is compatible with limiting global\nheating to 1.5\u00b0C, and 69% more fossil fuels than is compatible with the\nriskier 2\u00b0C target (28).\n\nThe market cost of oil, coal, and natural gas is distorted by subsidies and\ndoes not include negative externalities related to pollution, climate change,\nhealthcare, and others (29). Worse, the false promise (30) and widespread\nallure of unregulated quick fixes, such as \u201cnet-zero\u201d contracts that lack\nmonitoring, auditing, and verification, threaten to derail even the best-\nintentioned commercial and governmental plans for climate stabilization (31).\nInvestigations suggest that the great majority of products transacted on\ncarbon offset markets remove very little GHG from the atmosphere (32), and\nmodels indicate that even direct removal of atmospheric CO_2 does not recover\nformer environmental conditions crucial to food and water security or\necosystem restoration (33).\n\nWe do not promote a \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d philosophy regarding the future of human\ncivilization. We are optimistic that humanity can correct the unsustainable\npathway that we are on. Later in this review, we describe necessary steps in\nthis direction. However, we do take an objective and realistic stand on the\nissue of sustainability. The realities described here quantify a severe and\nimmediate threat to human health and well-being. They emphasize the imperative\nfor a rapid, sweeping reduction in GHG emissions, and highlight stubborn\nbarriers that impede progress. Developed nations, emerging economies, and\ncommercial entities must invest in rapid decarbonization; correct market\ndistortions favoring fossil fuels; and avoid the spurious trap of false \u201cnet-\nzero\u201d offsets as an excuse to continue polluting the atmosphere.\n\n## Imperialism, overpopulation, and resource extraction\n\nAround the world, a growing number of entities and environmental activists are\ntaking action (34). As of December 2022, there have been 2,180 climate-related\nlegal cases filed in 65 jurisdictions, including international and regional\ncourts, tribunals, quasijudicial bodies, or other adjudicatory bodies.\nLawsuits related to climate change have more than doubled over the last 5\nyears as litigants see courts as a way to enhance (or delay) climate action\n(35). Children and youth, women's groups, local communities, and Indigenous\nPeoples, among others, are taking a prominent role in bringing these cases and\ndriving climate change governance reform around the world. This \u201cclimate\njustice movement\u201d seeks to extend the principles of human rights and\nenvironmental justice by arguing that future generations have a birthright to\na safe climate capable of sustaining genuine human development on a healthy\nand resilient planet (36).\n\nYet, for hundreds of years, various manifestations of imperialism, such as\nslavery, settler colonization, economic and cultural dominance, neocolonialism\n(37), and the forces of globalization, have promoted a mindset of class\nprivilege and wealth. Motivated by profit, the mechanisms of industrial\ncapitalism have pursued relentless resource depletion achieved by subjugation\nof local communities, erasure of Indigenous knowledge, and unsustainable\nplunder of the natural world (38).\n\nModern imperialism is embodied by industrial capitalism, which prioritizes\nresource extraction and maximizing profit. This paradigm is deeply embedded in\nthe fabric of global affairs, influencing international trade, political\ndynamics, and the economic frameworks of nations (39). The persistent reliance\non extractive economic practices continues to be a significant obstacle to\nmaking critical progress in decarbonization, conserving natural resources, and\nensuring social equity. For instance, despite decades of international\ncommitments to end deforestation, around 4.1 M hectares of primary tropical\nrainforest was lost globally in 2022\u2014an increase of 10% over 2021\u2014producing\n2.7 Gt of CO_2 emissions, equivalent to the annual fossil fuel emissions of\nIndia (40). Most modern socioeconomic systems still follow extractive rules of\nexploitation and trade, and ignore natural rates of resource renewal, failing\nto consider that the end result is catastrophic (41).\n\nGlobal population growth amplifies the damage wrought by industrial\ncapitalism. On 15 November 2022, the world's population reached 8 billion\npeople. Human population is expected to increase by nearly 2 billion in the\nnext 30 years, and could peak at nearly 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s (42).\nCambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta developed a rigorous approach to the\nquestion \u201cWhat is optimal human population?\u201d (43). His theory relates\npopulation, consumption, and resource capacity, concluding that an optimal\nglobal population lies between 0.5 and 5 billion. This theory implies that\nEarth is already overpopulated relative to ecological carrying capacity. With\nevery additional person added to the planet, wild habitats are disturbed or\ndestroyed by urbanism, agricultural activities, and resource consumption, with\nhumanity demanding more than what the biosphere can sustainably provide.\n\nDasgupta highlights the critical connection between our economies,\nlivelihoods, and well-being with the Earth\u2019s resources. He argues that current\nglobal demand for natural resources surpasses its capacity to supply, driven\nby factors like population growth and consumption patterns. This overuse\nthreatens biodiversity and ecosystem services. To safeguard our prosperity and\nthe environment, we must rethink our approach to economic success. Key\nrecommendations include increasing nature's capacity and ensuring our demands\non nature stay within sustainable limits. This involves investing in natural\ncapital, revising economic metrics, transforming institutions (especially\nfinance and education), and empowering citizens. Legitimate sustainability is\nvital for achieving a long-term balance between population, economic growth,\nand the environment. Future generations\u2019 well-being hinges on how we manage\neconomic, social, and natural resources today. Urgent action is required to\naddress these interconnected challenges.\n\nGiven the current state of the ecosphere, a 25% increase in population and\nprojected doubling of economic activity by 2050 (44) may drive major\necological regime shifts (i.e. forest to savannah, savannah to desert, thawing\ntundra, and others) well before 2080. Nature may impose its own population\ncorrection before standard projections are realized (45). Actions to slow and\nreverse population growth are critical (46). These include empowering women,\ninvesting in girls\u2019 education, strengthening healthcare systems, and\nimplementing social welfare programs that create job opportunities, reduce\npoverty, and improve living standards.\n\nHuman population growth, increased economic demands, rising heat, and extreme\nweather events put pressures on ecosystems and landscapes to supply food and\nmaintain services such as clean water. Studies show that ecosystems threatened\nby sudden regime shifts are at greater risk of collapse than previously\nthought (47). Researchers warn that more than a fifth of ecosystems worldwide,\nincluding the Amazon rainforest, are at risk of a catastrophic breakdown\nwithin a human lifetime.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a suite of 17\nobjectives with 169 targets established in 2015 for achievement by 2030, face\na grim forecast: current trends suggest none of the goals and merely 12% of\nthe targets may be realized (48). This shortfall underscores the urgent need\nto dismantle the entrenched model of resource extraction and wealth\nconcentration, advocating for a paradigm shift toward genuine sustainability\nand resource regeneration. Such a transformation is imperative to reverse the\ntide of biodiversity loss due to overconsumption and to reinstate the security\nof food and water supplies, which are foundational for the survival of global\npopulations.\n\n## Global economics and values\n\nConvergence of worldwide trends threatens safe and sustainable human\ndevelopment: accelerating impacts from climate change (49), biodiversity loss\n(50) caused by unsustainable consumption (51), extractive agriculture, natural\nresource exploitation (52) and limitations, emergent disease (53), pervasive\npollution (54), and socioeconomic injustice (55). To secure a safe future for\nhumanity, global economics and values must protect the well-being of the\nnatural world. This requires understanding the impacts, intersections and\nfeedbacks of these global emergencies, as well as solutions to ensure a\nlivable planet (56). These emergencies, promulgated by extractive policies\n(57), human population growth, and modern imperialism (58), overlap in ways\nthat amplify negative outcomes (Fig. 1). If successive governments treat these\nissues in isolation, hesitate, or formulate shallow responses, the fallout may\nbe catastrophic. Without immediate action, we risk entering a malignant era of\nglobal distress and suffering characterized by disease, thirst and hunger,\nimpoverishment, and political instability.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nGlobal population growth, imperialism, and an economic model based on\nextractive rules of exploitation and trade that ignores natural rates of\nresource renewal, set the stage for a convergence of several worldwide trends\nthat threaten safe and sustainable human development: accelerating impacts\nfrom climate change, pollution, social inequality, biodiversity loss, and\ndisease.\n\nThe cocoon of wealth enjoyed by developed nations belies the suffering and\nmisery many low latitude and semiarid communities already endure in tenuous\nheat and drought conditions. Consider the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2023.\nOver 80% of the global population experienced climate change-driven heat in\nthe month of July (59) (Fig. 2). It featured 7 consecutive months of record-\nshattering global temperature driven by a combination of a moderately strong\nEl Ni\u00f1o and a decrease of Earth's albedo (equivalent to an increase of\natmospheric CO_2 from 420 to 530 ppm) (60). Extreme heatwaves swept many parts\nof the world. Sea surface temperatures leapt to record highs. Antarctic sea\nice was far below average. Record wildfires burned for months destroying tens\nof millions of acres and produced continental-scale public health crises in\nair quality, and tens of thousands of temperature records around the world\nwere broken. Without human-induced climate change these events would have been\nextremely rare (61).\n\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nIn 2023, astonishing new records were set in 2 m surface temperature, sea\nsurface temperature (SST), and global sea ice extent (2 m Temperature World,\nand SST World after Climate Reanalyzer, Climate Change Institute, University\nof Maine, https://climatereanalyzer.org/; Global Sea Ice Extent after\nhttps://zacklabe.com/global-sea-ice-extent-conc/).\n\nIt is past time to build a new era of reciprocity with nature that redefines\nnatural resource economics. The ecological contributions of Indigenous Peoples\nthrough their governance institutions and practices are gaining recognition\nand interest. Indigenous systems of land management encompass a holistic\napproach that values sacred, ethical, and reciprocal relationships with\nnature, integrating traditional knowledge and stewardship principles to\nsustainably manage land and water resources. Indigenous land management\nchallenges conventional power structures and introduces innovative solutions\nto environmental issues, especially in the context of climate change.\n\nIndigenous Peoples exercise traditional rights over a quarter of Earth's\nsurface, overlapping with a third of intact forests and intersecting about 40%\nof all terrestrial protected areas and ecologically intact landscapes. These\nlands typically have reduced deforestation, degradation, and carbon emissions,\ncompared with nonprotected areas and protected areas (62). Beyond western\nideas of quarantining land for conservation, Indigenous land management\ninvolves a mix of active land management, biomimicry, and conservation to\nmaximize nutrition, food and water security, carbon sequestration,\nbiodiversity, and ecosystem restoration (63). These qualities offer beneficial\nfeedbacks that increase human health and resiliency, build social equity, and\nprovide for the needs of future generations.\n\nWe suggest that an Indigenous worldview, that of kinship with nature, should\ndefine sustainable practices. Laws that establish legal rights for nature have\nreached a critical point at which they may either be normalized or\nmarginalized (64); this progress must be sustained. For instance, M\u0101ori in New\nZealand have successfully asserted sovereignty to grant legal personhood to\nthe Whanganui River and Te Urewera National Park. This reflects M\u0101ori\nworldviews and recognizes their governance, allowing \u201cnature\u201d to have a legal\nvoice. In the US, the Menominee Forest Management Reserve, recognized as a\nbest practice, is driven by the Menominee vision and worldviews. It operates\nunder the recognition of Menominee sovereignty and decision-making authority.\n\nNations must build on these regenerative practices by eliminating\nenvironmentally harmful subsidies (65), and restricting trade that generates\npollution and unsustainable consumption. Studies (66) indicate the global\neconomy must achieve absolute decoupling (in which resource impacts decline in\nabsolute terms) (67) if we are to eliminate \u201cecological overshoot\u201d^a (68).\n\nIn the words of coauthor Jay Bowen, Upper Skagit Elder, \u201cWe are all Indigenous\nto this Earth. We are one family.\u201d The authors of this review believe that\nhumanity stands at an inflection point in human history that will determine\nmany characteristics of future life on Earth (Fig. 3). Continued failure to\nintegrate these problems in climate resilient development and regenerative\npractices risks the stability of human communities and natural systems. Heads\nof state must recognize the existence of a global emergency (56), treat these\ncrises as intertwined issues, and apply the considerable power of the economy\ntoward restoring a livable planet and an equitable and just socioeconomic\nsystem before climate instability and ecological regime shift are beyond our\ncontrol. Later in this paper, we offer specific suggestions for implementing\nthese changes.\n\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nThe stability of human communities and natural ecosystems is at risk under the\nshocks and stresses of five planetary emergencies: socioeconomic inequality,\nclimate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and disease. Unless human values\nshift dramatically and soon, the resulting damage to the natural world will\nlikely be catastrophic, with long-lasting consequences for species and\necosystems, and devastating upheavals for humanity. A systemic change in human\nvalues is needed that focuses on Earth-centered governance, and entails a\ntransition in collective values, behaviors, and institutional practices to\nprioritize long-term ecological health and social well-being over immediate\ngains.\n\n## Climate realities and the road to action\n\nIn April 2023, CO_2 levels measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawai\u2018i\nreached an annual peak of 424.8 ppm, more than 50% greater than the\npreindustrial level of 278 ppm. In the first decade of measurement at Mauna\nLoa (1959\u20131968), the average annual growth rate was 0.8 ppm per year. The\naverage annual growth rate over the most recent decade (2014\u20132023) was 3 times\nthat amount, 2.4 ppm per year, the fastest sustained rate of increase in 65\nyears of monitoring (69).\n\nMore than half of all industrial CO_2 emissions have occurred since 1988 and\n40% of the CO_2 we emit today will still be in the atmosphere in 100 years,\nabout 20% will still be there in about 1,000 years (70). The last time CO_2\nlevels were this high was the Pliocene Climatic Optimum, 4.4 milion years ago,\nwhen Earth's climate was radically different; global temperature was 2\u20133\u00b0C\nhotter, beech trees grew near the South Pole, there was no Greenland ice\nsheet, no West Antarctic ice sheet, and global sea level was as much as 25 m\nhigher than today (71).\n\nAtmospheric methane (CH_4) growth has surged since 2020. Averaged over 2\ndecades, the global heating potential of CH_4 is 80 times greater than CO_2.\nThe largest sources of atmospheric CH_4 are wetlands, freshwater areas,\nagriculture, fossil fuel extraction, landfills, and fires. In 2023,\natmospheric CH_4 exceeded 1,919 ppb, on track to triple the preindustrial\nlevel of 700 ppb by 2030. Carbon isotopic signatures reveal microbial\ndecomposition of organic matter as the major source of CH_4 emissions,\nindicating that natural CH_4-producing processes are being amplified by\nclimate change itself (72). Is this a sign that global heating is shifting\nbeyond our control?\n\nUnder an intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5), GHG emissions are very likely to\nlead to heating of 1.2\u20131.8\u00b0C in the near term (2021\u20132040), 1.6\u20132.5\u00b0C in the\nmidterm (2041\u20132060), and 2.1\u20133.5\u00b0C in the long term (2081\u20132100) (73). As of\nNovember 2023, 145 countries had announced or are considering net-zero\ntargets, covering close to 90% of global emissions (74). Among these are\nChina, EU, USA, and India, who jointly represent more than half of global GHG\nemissions. However, net-zero evaluations for G20 countries and selected other\ncountries as of November 2023 show that most net-zero targets are formulated\nvaguely and do not yet conform with good practices.\n\nEven as the vast majority of countries pledged to slash their climate\nemissions, their own plans and projections put them on track to extract more\nthan twice the level of fossil fuels by 2030 than would be consistent with\nlimiting heating to 1.5\u00b0C, and nearly 70% more than would be consistent with\n2\u00b0C of heating (28). The world has a 67% chance of limiting warming to 2.9\u00b0C\nif countries stick to the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) made\nunder the 2015 Paris agreement (26). Emission cuts of 14 GtCO_2 or 28% are\nneeded by 2030 to keep within 2\u00b0C of warming. A reduction of more than 40% or\n22 GtCO_2 is needed for the 1.5\u00b0C threshold to be realistic.\n\nThe world now only has a 14% chance of limiting warming to the 1.5\u00b0C goal,\neven if countries honor all NDCs. Limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C would require\nglobal emission reduction of 8.7% per year. Even with COVID-19 lockdowns\nlimiting manufacturing, ground and air transportation, and other economic\nactivities during 2020, emissions dropped by only 4.7% (26).\n\nMany countries\u2019 net-zero pledges \u201care not currently considered credible\u201d (26).\nNo G20 country is reducing emissions at a pace consistent with their net-zero\ntargets. The lifetime emissions of current and planned oil and gas fields and\ncoal mines is 3 and a half times greater than the carbon budget needed to hold\ntemperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. It would exhaust almost all the budget needed\nfor 2\u00b0C.\n\nUnder current national climate plans, emissions are expected to rise 9% above\n2010 levels by the end of this decade even if NDCs are fully implemented. GHG\nemissions would fall to 2% below 2019 levels by 2030. Although these numbers\nsuggest the world will see emissions peak this decade, that's still far short\nof the 43% reduction against 2019 levels that the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) says is needed to stay within the 1.5\u00b0C target\nenvisioned by the Paris Agreement (26).\n\nEmission reductions of 43% are needed by 2030 to keep 1.5\u00b0C in play. But since\nthe 26th Conference of Parties (COP) in 2021, nations have shaved just 1% off\ntheir projected emissions for 2030, and COP 28 in 2023 ended with no increase\nin ambition. Seventy-five percent of nations that have set targets to limit\nGHG emissions have enshrined them in law or policy documents, but the plans\nneeded to implement those pledges are lacking in almost all cases (74), and\npolicies based on \u201cnet-zero\u201d actions no longer have credibility. Current\npledges would lead to long-term global heating of 2.4\u20132.6\u00b0C, but on-the-ground\npolicies put the world on track for heating approximately 3\u00b0C above\npreindustrial levels. Avoiding dangerous levels of heating requires systemic\ntransformation to energy, waste, transportation, agriculture, and industry.\n\nClimate indicators show that global heating reached 1.14\u00b0C averaged over the\npast decade, 1.26\u00b0C in 2022, and 1.45 \u00b1 0.12\u00b0C over the 12-month period of\n2023. In 2023, some 7.3 billion people worldwide were exposed, for at least 10\ndays, to temperatures influenced by global warming, with one-quarter of people\nfacing dangerous levels of extreme heat. Heating is increasing at an\nunprecedented rate of over 0.2\u00b0C per decade (perhaps faster) caused by a\ncombination of annual GHG emissions at an all-time high of 54 \u00b1 5.3 GtCO_2e\nover the last decade, and reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling (17).\nThe Northern Hemisphere summer of 2023 revealed a shift in climate indicators\nmarking a new level of intensity. \u201cThere has never been a summer like this in\nrecorded history: shocking ocean heat, deadly land heat, unprecedented fires\nand smoke, sea ice melting faster than we\u2019ve ever seen or thought possible\n(75).\u201d\n\n## Climate outlook\n\nPlanned cuts in global emissions are inadequate for protecting human security\nand Earth's remaining biodiversity. Under implemented national policies alone,\ndangerous heating is only avoidable with a massive rollout of GHG removal\ntechnologies and large-scale ecosystem restoration that is nowhere in evidence\ntoday. For instance, even the planned investment of $3.5B to develop four\n\u201cdirect air capture\u201d hubs under the 2022 US Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will\nonly remove the equivalent of 13 min of global emissions at full annual\ncapacity (30). Planting 8 billion trees, one for every person on Earth, would\nremove the equivalent of only 43 h of global emissions after the trees reached\nmaturity decades from now, and the change in albedo related to the new ground\ncover increases the complexity of expected benefits.\n\nThe only honest strategy for today is radical, immediate cuts in fossil fuel\nuse. Only after emissions have begun a rapid downward trajectory should\ninvestments in carbon removal (the engineering for which has yet to be defined\nor validated) occur with speed and at scale (76). Even this will be met with\nocean outgassing of CO_2 such that climate recovery will see a long delay\n(33).\n\nThis urgency is underscored by the fact that current emissions are\nunderreported, and decreasing natural carbon storage makes limiting global\ntemperatures even more challenging. Global emissions are as much as 3 times\nhigher than reported (77) with 70% underreporting of energy-related CH_4\nemissions alone (78). In addition, the terrestrial biome, which sequesters\nabout 31% of anthropogenic CO_2 emissions, has already neared, and in places\ncrossed, a photosynthetic thermal maximum beyond which terrestrial carbon\nstorage will grow increasingly impossible (79). For instance, global carbon\nloss from tropical forests has doubled in the last 20 years (80), and the\nBrazilian portion of the Amazon Forest has become a net GHG source (81).\nEighty-three percent of tropical forest carbon loss is driven by agriculture,\nsuggesting that strategies to reduce deforestation have failed, and that\ncarbon emissions from forest destruction are undercounted (82).\n\nThe United Nations estimates that 1.84 billion people worldwide, or nearly a\nquarter of humanity, were living under drought in 2022 and 2023, the vast\nmajority in low- and middle-income countries (83). Megadrought projected for\nthe year 2100 could strike up to 50 years earlier according to models (84).\nGlobal heating risks food (85) and water (86) availability with human\npopulations in conditions of extreme to exceptional drought (87) doubling by\n2100 (88).\n\nClimate change threatens natural ecosystems (89), human security (90), livable\nconditions for communities (91), and the stability of 1/3 of the human\npopulation (18). Under current levels of heating, people are 15 times more\nlikely to die from extreme weather than in years past, and 3.3 billion human\nlives are \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d to climate change (92). At 2\u00b0C heating, up to 3\nbillion people may suffer chronic water scarcity. Today, 1 in 3 people are\nexposed to deadly heat stress. This number is projected to increase up to 75%\nby the end of the century.\n\nBy 2050, over 300 million people living on coasts will be exposed to flooding\nfrom sea level rise (93). Forced to migrate, the impacts of these displaced\ncommunities will ripple through the larger population. Climate change drives\nthe spread of disease in people, crops, domesticated animals, and wildlife.\nEven if heating is held below 1.6\u00b0C, 8% of today's farmland will be unfit to\nproduce food. Declining food production and nutrient losses will result in\nsevere stunting affecting 1 million children in Africa alone and cause 183\nmillion additional people to go hungry by 2050 (92).\n\n## Abrupt change\n\nEarth's biophysical systems are shifting toward instability (94), perhaps\nirreversibly (95). The IPCC has identified 15 Earth system components with\npotential for abrupt destabilizing change, including ice, ocean, and air\ncirculation; large ecosystems; and precipitation. These systems are the\npillars of life that permit stable plant, animal, and microbial communities,\nfood production, clean water and establish the conditions for safe human\ndevelopment. However, these systems may be characterized by threshold\nbehavior. That is, they appear to remain stable as global temperature rises,\nbut at a certain level of heating, they may \u201ctip\u201d into a fundamentally\nirreversible new state (96).\n\nAs Earth retains heat, ice melt accelerates (97), especially in the Arctic\nwhich is heating nearly 4 times faster than the global average (98). Arctic\nsea ice is declining (99), and the transition from a snow- to rain-dominated\nArctic in the summer and autumn may occur as early as 2040, with profound\nclimatic, ecosystem, and socioeconomic impacts (100). The Greenland Ice Sheet\nis vulnerable to ice loss due to melt-elevation feedback (101), and Greenland\nis losing ice 7 times faster than in the 1990s (102). Antarctic melting has\ntripled in the past 5 years (103), and ice shelf collapse may lead to\namplified sea level rise (104, 105).\n\nAccording to one study, if temperatures rise by 1.5\u00b0C, the loss of four\nbiophysical systems will become \u201clikely\u201d and loss of an additional six will be\n\u201cpossible.\u201d Loss of 13 biophysical systems will be either \u201clikely\u201d or\n\u201cpossible\u201d if the planet warms by 2.6\u00b0C, as expected under current climate\npolicies (94). Emerging changes such as deep ocean heating (106), marine\nstratification (107), declining marine vertical circulation (108), and sea\nlevel rise (109) will continue for centuries even if net-zero emission targets\nare reached. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report\n6, Working Group I (110) projects possibly abrupt and irreversible change in\npermafrost carbon, West Antarctic ice sheets and shelves, and ocean\nacidification and deoxygenation. These changes could unleash feedback loops\nthat place climate impacts beyond our control (111).\n\n## Oceans\n\nThe world's oceans face irreversible impacts from climate change, with\nheating, acidification, stratification, and loss of dissolved oxygen posing\nhigh costs for marine ecosystems (112). Ocean heating has intensified (113),\nwith the Southern Ocean taking up most of the excess heat generated by\nanthropogenic activities (114). These changes affect marine species\ndistributions, interactions, abundance, and biomass. Combined with other\nstressors like pollution, they are putting marine biodiversity and its\nsocietal benefits at risk (115).\n\nAmplified by global heating (116), marine biodiversity is being decimated by\nmore than 440,000 industrial fishing vessels around the world that are\nresponsible for 72% of the world's ocean catch. Over 35% of the world\u2019s marine\nfishery stock is overfished and another 57% is sustainably fished at the\nmaximum level (117). One study showed that more than 90% of the world's marine\nfood supplies are at risk from environmental changes such as rising\ntemperatures and pollution, essential to over 3.2 billion people. Top\nproducers like China, Norway and the United States face the biggest threat\n(118). Marine heatwaves (119) are increasing with negative impacts on marine\norganisms and ecosystems. Marine coastal biodiversity is at risk, with over\n98% of coral reefs projected to experience bleaching-level thermal stress by\n2050 (120).\n\nRelative to the period 1995\u20132014, global mean sea level is conservatively\nprojected to rise 0.15\u20130.29 m by 2050, and 0.28\u20131.01 m by 2100 (109). Higher\nrise would ensue from disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves and faster-than-\nprojected ice melt from Greenland (121). On multiple occasions over the past 3\nmillion years, when temperatures increased 1\u20132\u00b0C, global sea levels rose at\nleast 6 m above present levels (122). Sea level rise will flood toxic waste\nsites, cesspools and septic systems, municipal dumps, and polluted\ngroundwater. In many cases, communities of color will be first to experience\nhealth impacts (123).\n\nOcean pollution affects marine species and people who depend on them. Toxic\nmetals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial\nwastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural\nrunoff, and sewage are the most detrimental and persistent pollutants (124).\nMore than 80% of marine pollutants originate from land-based sources, reaching\nthe oceans through rivers, runoff, and atmospheric deposition. Pollution is\nheaviest in coastal waters, especially in low- and middle-income countries\n(125).\n\nToxic metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium accumulate in marine animals,\ncausing health problems in fish species and disrupting endocrine systems in\ntheir human consumers (126). Plastics take hundreds of years to degrade,\nbreaking down into microplastics that are ingested by fish, humans, and other\norganisms (127). Manufactured chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls and\ndioxins are environmentally persistent toxins that accumulate in the tissues\nof marine animals, disrupting hormonal systems (128). Urban and agricultural\nrunoff, and sewage contain pathogens (129), heavy metals, and organic\ncompounds that harm marine animals and cause human health problems. Nitrogen\npollution also results in toxic algal blooms and oxygen-depleted dead zones\n(130). The equity and justice implications of this massive problem have been\nlargely overlooked or downplayed (131).\n\n## Terrestrial biome\n\nTropical forests now emit more carbon than they are able to absorb from the\natmosphere as a result of the dual effects of deforestation and land\ndegradation (132). Rich-nation demand (133) for lumber, minerals, beef, and\nanimal feed outside their own borders undermine attempts to mitigate climate\nchange (134). Demand for food, feed, fiber, minerals, and energy is resulting\nin whole forests being clear-cut. CO_2 emissions from boreal forest fires have\nreached a new high, producing nearly 1/4 of the total global CO_2 emissions\nfrom wildfires (135). Only 40% of remaining forests have high ecosystem\nintegrity (136). Forests are degraded (137) by drought, pests, and wildfire\nrelated (138) to climate change.\n\nForest loss sacrifices soil biodiversity and integrity to oxidation,\ndehydration, and heating, transforming soil into a persistent source of CO_2\nemission (139). Only 2.9% of Earth's land remains ecologically intact (140).\nEssential ecosystems are disappearing, and many species are at risk of\nextinction (141). Anthropogenic extinction rates are driving Earth's sixth\nmass extinction (142). Each year, the world consumes more than 92 Gt of\nmaterials\u2014biomass (mostly food), metals, fossil fuels, and minerals. This\nfigure is growing at the rate of 3.2% per year. Resources are being extracted\nfrom the planet 3 times faster than in 1970, even though the population has\nonly doubled within that time (143). During the 20th century, this boosted the\nglobal economy, but since then resources have become more expensive to extract\nand the environmental costs harder to ignore.\n\nBoth plant and soil carbon storage originate with photosynthesis, which\nwithdraws about 31% of annual anthropogenic CO_2 emissions (2). However,\nstudies (144) across a range of forest ecosystems have found that heating\nleads to thermal stress and reduced carbon assimilation. Many ecosystems (80)\nare already operating at or beyond thermal thresholds for photosynthesis\n(145). Widespread terrestrial ecological decline has resulted from the\ncombination of climate change, resource extraction, bushmeat hunting, and\nagricultural and urban development. Since 1970, vertebrate populations have\ndeclined 69% (146), and 1 in 4 species are at risk of extinction (147), in\npart because 75% of the terrestrial environment has been severely altered by\nhuman actions.\n\nAgricultural development has further eroded ecosystem health, with over 15\nbillion trees per year lost since the emergence of agriculture; the global\nnumber of trees has fallen by over 45% (148). An estimated 67,340 km^2 of\nglobal forest were lost in 2021 alone, unleashing 3.8 Gt of GHG emissions,\nroughly 10% of the global average (149). Such losses extend to wetland areas;\nmore than 85% of the wetlands present in 1700 had been lost by 2000, and loss\nof wetlands is currently 3 times faster than forest loss.\n\n## Food and water security\n\nIncreasing human population, and the need to expand food production, were the\ndrivers of the Green Revolution over 50 years ago (150). This increased\nproductivity through selective genetic breeding, monocultures, seed\nimprovement, and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These steps\nhave not solved the problem of food insecurity which has been aggravated in\nmore vulnerable populations (151). Worldwide, it is estimated that 16,000\nchildren are pushed into hunger every day\u2014a 32% increase from 2022 (152).\n\nAgriculture now uses half of the world's ice- and desert-free land, and causes\n78% of global ocean and freshwater eutrophication (153). Pesticide and\nfertilizer runoff, as well as sewage, find their way to aquatic environments\n(154) and degrade water quality, while spreading infectious diseases. Humans\npoison the soil annually with microplastics between 4 and 23 times more than\nwe do the oceans. Microplastics reduce beneficial bacteria concentrations, and\ncan be absorbed by plants, and then passed up the food chain (155).\n\nIndustrial farming employs deep plowing that depletes and oxidizes soil,\nturning acreage into a source of GHG (156). Agriculture is responsible for 70%\nof global freshwater withdrawals (157). By one estimate (158), 94% of nonhuman\nmammal biomass is now livestock, and 71% of bird biomass is poultry livestock.\n50% of all agricultural expansion has come at the expense of forests. In 2022,\nthe rate of global deforestation was the equivalent of 11 soccer/football\nfields per minute (40), predominantly for cattle ranching and grain animal\nfeed crops (such as soy) for export.\n\nToday, agriculture uses half of all habitable land (159), and either through\ngrazing or growing animal feed, 77% of that is dedicated to livestock (153).\nAnimal agriculture is expanding. From 1998 to 2018 global meat consumption\nincreased 58%. Cattle and the grain they eat use 1/3 of all available land\nsurface, 1/3 of global grain production, and 16% of all available freshwater.\nYet cattle agriculture only generates 18% of food calories and 27% of protein\n(153). The production of fertilizer for feed crops emits 41 MtCO_2/yr. The\ncombination of emissions from manufacturing, transporting, and applying\nsynthetic fertilizer on the land (which releases the potent GHG N_2O) today\nlikely outpaces the emissions of the commercial aviation industry. These\nfertilizer-related GHG emissions are projected to grow. Additionally,\nlivestock feed demands a minimum of 80% of global soybean crop and over 50% of\nglobal corn crop. Thirty-five to 40% of yearly anthropogenic CH_4 emissions\nare a result of domestic livestock production due to enteric fermentation and\nmanure (160).\n\nUnder a range of GHG emission pathways, cropland exposure to drought and heat-\nwave events will increase by a factor of 10 in the midterm and a factor of\n20\u201330 in the long term on all continents, especially Asia and Africa (161).\nHarvest failures across major crop-producing regions are a threat to global\nfood security. Jet stream changes are projected to increase synchronous crop\nfailure and lower crop yields in multiple agricultural regions around the\nworld (162). Crop failure due to drought, flood, or extreme weather (163)\nevents increases disproportionately between 1.5 and 2\u00b0C of global heating\n(164). For maize, risks of multiple breadbasket failures increase from 6\u2013 40%\nat 1.5\u00b0C to 54% at 2\u00b0C. In relative terms, the highest climate risk increases,\nbetween 1.5 and 2\u00b0C heating, is for wheat (40%), followed by maize (35%) and\nsoybean (23%). Limiting global heating to 1.5\u00b0C would reduce the risk of\nsimultaneous crop failure for maize, wheat, and soybean by 26%, 28%, and 19%,\nrespectively (164).\n\nDemand for wheat is projected to increase 60% by 2050. Yet, rising CO_2\ndepletes the nutrient and protein content of wheat, and with drought, fire,\nand flood, leads to a 15% decline in projected wheat yield by midcentury\n(165). Increased levels of CO_2 are decreasing the amount of protein, iron,\nzinc, and B vitamins in rice with potential adverse health consequences for a\nglobal population of approximately 600 million (166). Harvests of staple\ncereal crops, such as rice and maize, could decrease by 20\u201340% as a function\nof heightened surface temperatures in tropical and subtropical regions by 2100\n(167). This will exacerbate existing food security issues, as 1 billion people\nare currently classified as food insecure (168).\n\nWorldwide, fungal infections cause growers to lose 10\u201323% of their crops each\nyear, and an additional 10\u201320% is lost following harvest. Global heating is\ndriving a poleward migration of fungal infections, meaning more countries will\nsee fungal infections damaging harvests. Growers have reported wheat stem rust\ninfections, usually tropical, in Ireland and England. Experts (169) also warn\nthat fungi tolerance to higher temperatures could increase the likelihood of\nsoil-dwelling pathogens to infect animals or humans. Across the five most\nimportant calorie crops of rice, wheat, maize (corn), soybeans, and potatoes,\nfungal infections already cause losses equal to provisions for 600 million to\n4 billion people. Without major and rapid policy changes, food productivity in\n2050 could be reduced to 1980 yield levels because new technologies will be\nunable to mitigate climate change in major growing regions (170).\n\nClean water security is a critical issue (171). Research shows that\ngroundwater levels are rapidly declining, especially in dry regions with\nextensive croplands, and has accelerated over the past four decades in 30% of\nthe world's regional aquifers (172). The Southern Hemisphere has experienced a\n20% drop in water availability over the past two decades (173). Approximately\n3.6 billion people, or 47% of the global population, suffer water scarcity at\nleast 1 month each year (174). Global water security is an urgent concern due\nto the increasing imbalance between the finite supply of freshwater and the\nescalating demand driven by population growth, economic development, and\nagricultural needs. Climate change compounds the crisis by altering\nprecipitation patterns, causing droughts, and depleting glaciers\u2014key\nfreshwater sources. Contamination from industrial, agricultural, and\nresidential waste further restricts the amount of clean water available. This\nscarcity threatens human health, food production, and ecosystem stability,\nleading to conflicts and displacements. Addressing this problem requires\nglobal cooperation for sustainable management, technological innovation for\nconservation and purification, and policies that prioritize equitable access\nto clean water (174).\n\n## Heat\n\nThe impact of heat on food production is disproportionately severe in low-\nincome communities. Workers in agriculture, construction, and other outdoor\nsectors often work in conditions that can lead to heat stress or heatstroke.\nFood production, too, is critically affected as extreme heat can reduce crop\nyields, increase irrigation needs, and lead to soil degradation. These\ncommunities have less access to heat-protection technologies such as air-\nconditioned spaces, efficient irrigation systems, or heat-resistant crop\nvarieties. Consequently, their economic stability and food security are more\nvulnerable to climate-induced temperature increases, exacerbating existing\ninequalities and pushing these populations further into poverty.\n\nIn 2022, global heat stress caused the loss of 490 billion potential labor\nhours, 143 h per person, a 42% increase from the 1991 to 2000 average (175).\nThe loss of labor due to heat exposure resulted in a $863 billion loss of\n\u201cpotential income\u201d and wiped out the equivalent of 4% of Africa's GDP. The\nagriculture sector was hardest hit, accounting for 82% of losses in least\ndeveloped countries. The global land area affected by at least 1 month of\nextreme drought per year increased from 18% averaged over the decade 1951\u20131960\nto 47% in the decade 2013\u20132022. Because of heat stress, under a 2\u00b0C warming\nscenario, 525 million additional people will experience food insecurity by\nmidcentury, compared to the period 1995\u20132014, and the number of heat-related\ndeaths each year will increase by 370%. Older people and infants now are\nexposed to twice the number of heat-wave days annually as they were averaged\nover the period 1986\u20132005.\n\nHeat-related deaths of people older than 65 have increased by 85% since the\n1990s (175). Even under moderate warming, heat and drought levels in Europe\nthat were virtually impossible 20 years ago reach 1-in-10 likelihoods as early\nas the 2030s (84). Averaged over the period 2050\u20132074, projections for two\nsuccessive years of single or compound end-of-century extremes, unprecedented\nto date, exceed 1-in-10 likelihoods; while Europe-wide 5-year megadroughts\nbecome plausible. Whole decades of end-of-century heat stress could start by\n2040, by 2020 for drought, and with a warm North Atlantic, end-of-century\ndecades starting as early as 2030 become twice as likely.\n\nFor thousands of years, fundamental limits on food and water security meant\nthat human communities have concentrated under a narrow range of climate\nvariables characterized by mean annual temperatures (MATs) around 13\u00b0C (18).\nWith continued GHG emissions, global heating of 3\u00b0C is projected to drive a\nMAT >29\u00b0C across 19% of the planet's land surface and displace one-third of\nthe human population. Today, this MAT accounts for only 0.8% percent of\nEarth's land surface, mostly concentrated in the deep Sahara.\n\nModel projections indicate that in the Middle East and North Africa, continued\nemissions will cause the emergence of unprecedented super- and ultraextreme\nheat-wave conditions (176). These events involve excessively warm temperatures\n(56\u00b0C and higher) and will be of extended duration (several weeks), quickly\nbecoming life-threatening for humans (177). Researchers found that by 2100,\nunder current levels of GHG emissions, 3 of 4 people in the world will be\nexposed to deadly heat conditions every year, with a higher occurrence of\nthese conditions in intertropical areas (2). Coupled with significant\nsocioeconomic differences within countries, heat waves intensify global\ndisparities in health, especially given the depleted resources for several of\nthese regions to respond to accelerated heating. In the last decade, there has\nbeen >2,300% increase in the loss of human life from heat waves as a result of\nabout 1\u00b0C heating. On our current pathway, the global health and socioeconomic\nrisks of continued heating are catastrophic.\n\nThe distribution of these conditions is unequal, and people and communities\nsubjected to the loss of security are powerless to respond. The impacts of\nthis inequity may cause regionally existential deterioration and suffering. As\ntemperatures rise, death rates increase most among the poorest populations\n(178). By 2099, under a scenario of continued high emissions growth, climate\nchange increases death rates in low-income countries by over 106 deaths per\n100,000, while high-income countries are projected to see death rates decrease\nby 25 deaths per 100,000, while spending significantly to prevent more deaths.\nOverall, today's rich countries pay nearly 3 times more than poor countries to\nadapt to rising temperatures and prevent additional deaths. When it comes to\ncutting emissions, the social and economic burden of inaction is predominantly\ncarried by the poorest and most vulnerable in human society, including\nIndigenous and local communities, concentrated in developing countries.\n\n## Illness and disease\n\nAs the planet heats up, infectious diseases once confined to tropical regions\nare expanding their range. The World Health Organization estimates that by the\nend of this decade the climate impact on health will cost between $2 billion\nand $4 billion per year (179). Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is\nexpected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from, for\nexample, undernutrition, malaria, cholera, diarrhea, and heat stress alone.\nThis does not include massive climate burdens on agriculture, water, and\nsanitation, which also shape public health.\n\nIn July 2023, for the first time in 20 years, the United States experienced\nlocally acquired malaria infections. Six cases were confirmed in Florida and\none in Texas, none related to international travel (180). In Seattle, cases of\nWest Nile disease were reported for the first time. Over half of the\ninfectious diseases confronted by humanity have been aggravated by climatic\nhazards at some point (181). All communities are vulnerable to climate change\nimpacts; however, children, elders, the sick, and the poor face the greatest\nrisks (182). People with cardiovascular and/or respiratory chronic illnesses\nare particularly vulnerable to high temperatures (183). Air pollution from GHG\nemissions leads to increased health complications such as asthma and\nallergies. The impacts of climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable\ncommunities, including low-income regions and communities of color which have\nbeen disempowered by a history of colonialism, racism, oppression, and\ninjustice. Extreme weather events further exacerbate the situation, driving\nanimals and people together in unsanitary conditions and disrupting essential\nservices like healthcare and clean water supplies.\n\nApproximately 17% of diseases are spread by animal vectors causing over\n700,000 deaths annually. Concentrated animal farming operations are breeding\ngrounds for virulent pathogens (184), and over 15,000 new cases of mammals\ntransmitting viruses to other mammals could occur in the next 50 years due to\nclimate change (185). Smaller species like bats, rats, and other rodents are\nthriving in human-populated areas, contributing to the spread of diseases\nthrough their interactions. Biodiversity loss and deforestation are directly\nlinked to the rise of infectious diseases, with 1/3 of zoonotic diseases\nattributed to these factors. Some 60% of known pathogens, and 3 out of every 4\nnew or emergent infectious diseases are zoonotic (186), and roughly 1/3 of\nthose are attributed to deforestation and habitat loss (187). A new disease\nsurfaces 5 times a year, and future global heating and precipitation changes\nwill further expand habitats for pathogens and vectors, proliferating dengue\nfever, cholera, malaria, diarrhea, and other diseases (188).\n\nClimate change intensifies the spread of infectious diseases, particularly in\nlow-income communities, by expanding the habitats of disease vectors such as\nmosquitoes and ticks. Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns\nincrease the incidence and geographic range of vector-borne diseases like\nmalaria and dengue fever. Flooding and extreme weather events, more common as\nthe climate changes, can lead to waterborne diseases due to the contamination\nof freshwater supplies. Low-income areas often have insufficient healthcare\ninfrastructure, making them more vulnerable to these outbreaks. Additionally,\nmalnutrition from climate-induced food scarcity can weaken immune systems,\nfurther raising the susceptibility to infections. Thus, climate change\nmagnifies health disparities, with low-income communities facing\ndisproportionately high risks of disease.\n\n## Economic inequality, ecological destruction, and global security\n\nA grossly unequal distribution of wealth couples with the increasing\nconsumption patterns of a rising global middle class (189) to amplify\necological destruction. The poorest half of the global population owns barely\n2% of total global wealth, while the richest 10% owns 76% of all wealth (190).\nThe poorest 50% of the global population contribute just 10% of emissions,\nwhile the richest 10% emit more than 50% total carbon emissions (191). Climate\nchange, economic inequality, and rising consumption levels intertwine to\namplify ecological destruction.\n\nClimate change, driven by carbon emissions, often stems from industrial\nactivities catering to increased consumption, particularly in wealthier\nnations. This consumption depletes natural resources and exacerbates pollution\nand habitat loss. Economic inequality compounds these issues, as poorer\ncommunities lack the resources to adapt to environmental changes or invest in\nsustainable practices. Consequently, low-income communities bear the brunt of\necological degradation, such as soil erosion, water scarcity, and biodiversity\nloss, while their limited economic means prevent effective response or\nrecovery. This cycle of consumption, inequality, and environmental impact\ncreates a feedback loop, perpetuating and intensifying ecological damage\nglobally.\n\nFifty years ago, underdevelopment and scarcity were drivers of unsustainable\nresource use, but today these roots have morphed into overdevelopment,\naffluence, and privilege driving unsustainable wealth accumulation and\naggregate consumption. At present, not a single country delivers what its\ncitizens need without transgressing planetary boundaries of long-term\nsustainability (192). Modern imperialism amplifies these inequalities through\neconomic exploitation, wealth accumulation, political interference, cultural\ndominance, and other methods that leverage colonial power structures.\nRecognizing and addressing neocolonial practices is crucial for promoting\nequitable and sustainable development and respecting the sovereignty and self-\ndetermination of nations (193).\n\nThe use of natural materials and their benefits are unevenly distributed\nacross the globe. Overconsumption is closely linked to wealth and income\ndisparities with large amounts of money concentrated in a few rich countries,\nlargely in the Northern Hemisphere (194). For example, environmental stresses\nand shocks related to natural resource extraction and use are outsourced to\ncountries and regions outside the European Union, while more than 85% of the\neconomic benefits stay within member countries (195).\n\nGlobal inequality results in fragile regions where intensified conflict over\nscarce resources allows malevolent actors to thrive (196). One study (197)\nfound strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across\nall major regions of the world: for each 1 SD (1\u03c3) change in climate toward\nwarmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, data show that the frequency of\ninterpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises\n14%. Temperatures across the developed world are expected to warm 2\u03c3 to 4\u03c3 by\n2050. Hence, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and\ncritical impact of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nOver the next 3 decades, even under best-case scenarios of low heating,\nnational, and global security face severe risks in every region of the world.\nHigher levels of heating will pose catastrophic, and likely irreversible,\nglobal security risks over the course of the 21st century. A world where\nglobal mean surface temperature has increased 3\u00b0C will be characterized by\nwidespread and intense heat stress, extreme weather events, ruptured and\nunproductive marine and terrestrial ecosystems, broken food systems, disease\nand morbidity, intense decadal megadrought, freshwater scarcity, catastrophic\nsea level rise, and large numbers of migrant populations. By 2050, under these\nmalignant conditions, up to 1.2 billion humans could be displaced by climate\nchange (198). These intensifying crises now threaten the very fabric of our\nglobal socioeconomic system. Immediate action is imperative to avert a\ncollapse that endangers societal structures worldwide.\n\n## Climate purgatory\n\nAlthough the global condition is bleak, after 200 years of fossil fuel\nexpansion, we are at a turning point in the energy system. The clean-energy\nrevolution is underway. Global sales of vehicles powered by fossil fuels\npeaked in 2017 (199), and in 2023 electric vehicle sales grew by 55%, reaching\na record high of more than 10 million. For the first time ever, announced\nmanufacturing capacity for electric vehicle batteries is now sufficient to\nfulfill expected demand requirements by 2030 (200).\n\nRenewable energy installations jumped nearly 50% in 2023, the most rapid\ngrowth rate in two decades (200). After remaining flat for several years,\nglobal clean energy spending is increasing. Last year, renewables made up\nabout 30% of total electricity generation, up from 25% in 2018. Global\ninvestment in the energy transition totaled $1.77 trillion in 2023, an\nincrease of 17% from the prior year. Solar energy is expected to become the\ncheapest form of energy in many places by 2030 and major global powers are\ninvesting in infrastructure for energy transformation.\n\nHowever, increasing global energy consumption offsets these gains in renewable\nenergy. Because of rising power needs in developing nations due to population\ngrowth and industrialization, ongoing electrification of the transport and\nbuilding sectors, and other areas of energy expansion, the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA) projects increasing growth of energy demand, rising at an\nannual average rate of 3.4% in 2024\u20132026. Although the expansion of clean-\nenergy sources is set to meet this demand growth, decoupling energy\nconsumption and CO_2 production, the separation is not nearly wide enough to\nmeet Paris Agreement Goals for stopping global heating.\n\nCountries and companies are taking steps to address climate change while\nsimultaneously making choices that undermine these efforts. This paradox\nplaces us in a state of climate purgatory. The IEA predicts (200) a peak in\nfossil fuel demand by 2030, but reports show governments planning to increase\ncoal, oil, and gas production well beyond climate commitments. This math does\nnot align with the 1.5\u00b0C or even the 2\u00b0C warming targets. Many experts\nconsider these targets nearly impossible due to the global reluctance to\nurgently phase out fossil fuels. In this climate purgatory, we are at a\ncritical juncture, where urgent, transformative action is required to\nreconcile our ambitions with our actions.\n\nThe 2023 UN \u201cgap report\u201d (26) tells us that governments plan to produce around\n110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming\nto 1.5\u00b0C, and 69% more than would be consistent with 2\u00b0C. National carbon-\ncutting policies are so inadequate that 3\u00b0C of heating could be reached this\ncentury. Based on existing national pledges, global emissions in 2030 will be\nonly 2% below 2019 levels, rather than the 43% cut required to limit global\nheating to 1.5\u00b0C. To get on track, 22 GtCO_2 must be cut from currently\nprojected global emissions in 2030. That is 42% of the total and equivalent to\nthe output of the world's five worst polluters: China, US, India, Russia, and\nJapan.\n\nThe world will need to increase climate spending to around $9 trillion\nannually by 2030 and to nearly $11 trillion by 2035 to roll out clean sources\nof energy and prepare for the inevitable impacts of a warming climate during\ncoming decades (201). To limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C now requires eliminating\nemissions shortly after 2040. Although technically feasible, few mainstream\nscientists believe it is still achievable (202). Instead, analysts predict\n(203) that global fossil fuel emissions will peak at some point in the next\ndecade, followed not by a decline but a long plateau (204), culminating with\nend-of-century warming potentially reaching 3\u00b0C (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nGlobal GHG emissions and temperature rise. Net emissions including removals\n(billion metric tons of CO_2-equivalent). Policy and technological progress\nover the past 8 years has significantly reduced the global temperature\noutlook. Models now project very likely temperature increases of 2.0 to 4.0\u00b0C\nby century's end, with a 2.3 to 3.4\u00b0C likely range and a mean of 2.8\u00b0C. While\nthis is progress from just 8 years ago, it still represents a dire climate\nfuture\u2014falling significantly short of the Paris Agreement goal of limiting\nwarming to well below 2\u00b0C (204).\n\nAlthough global renewable energy capacity is growing, there is a lack of\nfinancing for emerging and developing economies. Redirecting financial\nresources to lower income nations is crucial. More than 90% of clean-energy\ninvestment comes from advanced economies and China, risking new dividing lines\nin global energy. The biggest shortfalls in clean-energy investment are in\nemerging and developing economies. More needs to be done by the international\ncommunity to drive investment in lower income economies, where the private\nsector has been reluctant to venture. There is ample capital\navailable\u2014evidenced by the nearly $12 trillion allocated for COVID-19 economic\nrelief and the over $1 trillion annually in fossil fuel subsidies, which\nballoons to $7 trillion with indirect incentives. Reallocating these funds is\ncomplex, particularly due to potential impacts on the poorest populations, yet\nit remains a vital reservoir for investment as the world plans for a\nsustainable future.\n\n## A new era of reciprocity with nature and among human societies\n\nThe purpose of this review is to draw immediate attention to the careless,\nfoolish way that humanity is gambling with the future. Unless things change\ndramatically, and soon, damage to the natural world will have long-lasting\nconsequences for species and ecosystems, and devastating upheavals for\nhumanity. Although this will particularly affect vulnerable populations, all\nof humanity faces an unprecedented catastrophe.\n\nThere are signs that humanity is awakening to the need for a new system of\nvalues that recognize Earth as an island in space with limitations on resource\navailability. No one is coming to rescue us. Many of the changes that we call\nfor in this essay are consistent with the work of the Intergovernmental\nScience-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (141) and the\nUN SDG framework (205). But carbon assimilation in natural systems is\ndecreasing\u2014 potentially with significant effects in only decades; planetary-\nscale biophysical systems such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\nCirculation, the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, atmospheric Hadley\ncirculation, summer sea ice, tropical forests, and others have shifted and are\nprojected to falter. And urbanism, deforestation, consumerism, pollution,\ndisease, social stratification, and extractive agriculture are all on\naccelerating and expanding trends.\n\nThis is a human inflection point that will determine future conditions of life\non Earth (206). While transitioning to a carbon-free energy system comes with\nmajor societal restructuring, the socioeconomic adjustments needed to rapidly\ndecrease emissions also present opportunities for achieving social and\necological justice, reducing disease, promoting the successful achievement of\nSDGs, and securing food and water availablity for our children.\n\nWe can end pollution, improve human health, reign in population growth, and\nreduce further biophysical risks. Indigenous communities have practiced\nregenerative ways of managing natural resources by understanding the\nreciprocal relationship between humans and their natural surroundings. Nature\nis not a commodity for exploitation, but a living system with its own rights,\nwhere humans are life-supported and in turn play a regenerative role. This\nkinship promotes nature and humanity thriving together.\n\nUnder current national plans, global GHG emissions are set to increase 9% by\n2030, compared to 2010 levels. Yet the science is clear: emissions must fall\nby 45% by the end of this decade compared to 2010 levels to meet the goal of\nlimiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C (207). As governments invest in\nrenewable energy sources, there are enormous cobenefits to be gained in terms\nof disease reduction, social equity, and a growing respect for Earth's\nrhythms. Yet renewable energy will not address the root problem of ecological\novershoot, social justice, or pollution. Policies are needed that end the\nproduction of superfluous and luxury commodities, conserve energy at household\nand societal levels, stabilize global population, and replace the extractive\nmodel with one that emphasizes true sustainability so that more natural\nresources per capita become available and wealth is far more equitably\ndistributed (208).\n\nThe shift away from an extractive, resource-driven global economy toward one\nthat values human rights and livelihoods could redefine global economics and\noffer reasons for optimism. Opportunities to prevent catastrophic levels of\nheating are being missed due to accelerating consumerism, the false seduction\nof dubious climate quick fixes, unverifiable \u201ccarbon offsets\u201d, exorbitant\npollution levels, and growing economic disparity. Halting global ecological\ndecline and addressing the crises of climate change, biodiversity collapse,\npollution, pandemics, and human injustice requires a shift in economic\nstructures, human behavior, and above all, values.\n\nWhether the world is considered overpopulated depends on various factors. It\nis essential to consider not only population numbers but also consumption\npatterns, resource distribution, and sustainability when discussing this\ncomplex issue. Additionally, strategies for addressing concerns related to\npopulation growth often involve a combination of policies related to\neducation, healthcare, resource management, and environmental protection. In\ndeveloping economies, overpopulation is not just about how many people there\nare but also about how much each person consumes compared to the availability\nof resources.\n\nHigh levels of consumption in developed countries contribute to environmental\ndegradation, raising the issue of unequal distribution of resources. While\nsome regions may be densely populated and face resource constraints, others\nhave much lower population densities and abundant resources. Inequities in\nresource distribution can lead to perceptions of overpopulation but are in\nreality more closely related to social inequalities, often with deep\nhistorical roots related to imperialism and unjust resource extraction.\n\nHumans must become rejuvenators of natural systems (209). We must shift from\nwealth as a goal, to sustainaiblity as a goal driving our decisons. This\nincludes developing replacements for plastics, adopting regenerative and\nrestorative cultivation and harvesting methods, investing in cradle to grave\nresearch and development focused on material reuse, absolute decoupling of the\neconomy from net resource depletion, and establishing conservation goals to\nconserve 30\u201350% of Earth's land, freshwater, and oceans (210).\n\nAddressing social inequities based on gender, ethnicity, and income is\ncrucial, and leaders in political, educational, business, and religious\norganizations must analyze and redress discriminatory practices, historical\nracism, and unjust distributions of power that hinder communities from\nadapting to climate change. It is imperative to promote reproductive\nhealthcare, education, poverty eradication, ecological restoration,\nenvironmental justice, and reciprocal relationships with nature. Economic\ndevelopment must not come at the cost of destroying Earth.\n\nAs reported in numerous peer-reviewed studies (211), to reverse the many\nnegative impacts generated by our modern socioeconomic system there must be\nglobal investment in (Fig. 5):\n\n  1. Rapid and legitimate decarbonization, correcting market distortions favoring fossil fuels, avoiding the spurious trap of \u201cnet zero\u201d as an excuse to continue polluting the atmosphere (212), and proper monitoring, verification, and reporting of carbon offset contracts.\n\n  2. Revising the basis for decision-making under the UNFCCC. Decision-making under the UNFCCC should be reorganized by transitioning from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting, enabling decisions to be made with agreement from a defined majority of member nations. To encourage compliance and accountability, penalties such as financial sanctions could be introduced for noncompliance with UNFCCC decisions. These changes would enhance efficiency, enabling prompt action and stronger enforcement of climate-related agreements among member nations.\n\n  3. Building a new era of reciprocity and kinship with nature, and decoupling economic activity from net resource depletion. We must shift Earth-centered governance from an aspirational political issue to a foundational principle through constitutional reforms with policy implications (213).\n\n  4. Implementing sustainable/regenerative practices in all areas of natural resource economics including, especially, agriculture.\n\n  5. Eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies and restricting trade that promotes pollution and unsustainable consumption.\n\n  6. Promote gender justice by supporting women's and girls' education and rights, which reduces fertility rates and raises the standard of living.\n\n  7. Accelerating human development in all SDG sectors, especially promoting reproductive healthcare, education, and equity for girls and women.\n\n  8. In low- and middle-income nations, relieving debt, providing low-cost loans, financing loss and damage, funding clean-energy acceleration, arresting the dangerous loss of biodiversity, and restoring natural ecosystems.\n\nFig. 5.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nThe historical context of imperialism, population growth, and an extractive\nrelationship with nature has led to a series of modern outcomes that put our\nplanet at risk: disease, climate change, biodiversity loss, socioeconomic\ninequality, and pollution. These risk the stability of human communities.\nHumanity may achieve a just and sustainable future through global investment\nin rapid decarbonization, correcting market distortions favoring fossil fuels,\navoiding \u201cnet zero\u201d as an excuse to continue GHG emissions, proper monitoring\nand validation of carbon offsets, revising the basis for decision-making under\nthe UNFCCC, decoupling economic activity from net resource depletion, shifting\nto Earth-centered governance, sustainable/regenerative practices in all areas\nof natural resource economics, eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies,\nrestrict trade that promotes pollution and unsustainable consumption,\naccelerate human development in all SDG sectors, promote gender justice by\nsupporting women's and girls\u2019 education and rights which reduces fertility\nrates and raises the standard of living, and for low- and middle-income\nnations: relieve debt, provide low-cost loans, finance loss and damage, fund\nclean-energy acceleration, arrest the dangerous loss of biodiversity, and\nrestore natural ecosystems.\n\n## A cultural shift in values\n\nHow do we achieve these goals? The authors call for a global cultural shift in\nsocial and economic values. Creating a cultural shift toward regenerative\npractices in socioeconomic activities is complex and requires a multifaceted\napproach involving, critically, the leaders of the G20, and all nations,\ncomprehensively engaging programs in the following:\n\n  1. Education in sustainability and equity concepts: Increasing awareness and understanding of sustainability and equity issues through education at all levels to empower individuals to make more environmentally conscious decisions. Embedding sustainability and equity into educational curricula at all levels can shape future generations\u2019 values and actions. We advocate adoption of the issues discussed in this paper in school curricula, public service announcements, and as a guide to government decision-making.\n\n  2. Policy, legal frameworks, and legislation: Governments can enact and enforce policies that mandate sustainable practices and ensure social equity, such as progressive environmental regulations, social justice legislation, and economic reforms that prioritize community well-being over individual profit.\n\n  3. Economic incentives: Shifting the economic focus from growth at any cost to a model that values environmental and social well-being. Aligning economic incentives with sustainable outcomes, such as tax breaks for green businesses, can encourage companies and consumers to adopt better practices.\n\n  4. Cross-sector partnerships: Facilitating collaboration between the public sector, private sector, civil society, and academia to develop integrated and comprehensive approaches to sustainability and equity.\n\n  5. Community empowerment and inclusion: Encouraging participatory governance that includes diverse community voices in decision-making processes, particularly those of marginalized and indigenous groups, to ensure that practices are equitable and culturally sensitive.\n\n  6. Corporate responsibility and accountability: Promoting corporate social responsibility through transparency, fair trade, ethical sourcing, and sustainability reporting.\n\n  7. Incentives for sustainable/equitable behavior: Channeling investment into the development and deployment of green technologies that enable sustainable production and consumption patterns. Creating economic and social incentives for businesses and individuals to adopt sustainable practices, like subsidies for renewable energy or tax benefits for sustainable/equitable business practices.\n\n  8. Innovation and technology: Investing in research and development for new technologies can provide more efficient and cleaner alternatives to current practices.\n\n  9. Leadership and commitment: Encouraging leaders within communities, businesses, and governments to model sustainable and equitable behaviors. Leaders in business, politics, and community groups must commit to sustainability goals and lead by example to inspire others.\n\n  10. Cultural narratives: Leveraging media, art, and culture to promote stories and images that valorize sustainability and equity, thereby shaping public opinion and cultural values. Changing the cultural narratives around consumption and progress to value sustainability and long-term thinking over immediate gratification or economic growth at any cost.\n\n  11. Global engagement and solidarity: Participating in international efforts and agreements that aim to address global challenges collectively, ensuring that sustainability and social equity are global priorities.\n\nThis systemic transformation requires a shift in collective values, behaviors,\nand institutional practices to prioritize long-term ecological health and\nsocial well-being over immediate gains.\n\nHeads of state must immediately pivot the considerable power of the economy\ntoward restoring a livable planet and an equitable and just socioeconomic\nsystem. To achieve a successful future where humanity can thrive, economic\nvalues must embrace human equity, health, and welfare, kinship with nature,\nregenerative resource use, sustainability, and resilience. Emphasizing\nfairness and inclusivity, these values promote social cohesion and reduce\ndisparities.\n\nRecognizing our interconnectedness with the environment, a focus on\nsustainability and regenerative resource use ensures the preservation of\nnature for future generations. Prioritizing health and well-being, societies\nmust invest in healthcare systems, fostering a higher quality of life by\nbuilding resilience against uncertainties. A new economic paradigm is needed\nto create a prosperous and harmonious future, meeting the challenges of a\nrapidly deteriorating world.\n\n## Earth is our lifeboat in the sea of space\n\nAs succinctly stated by Rees (68), \u201cWe are consuming and polluting the\nbiophysical basis of our own existence.\u201d Climate change, biodiversity loss,\npollution, disease, and social injustice risk the stability of human\ncommunities on Earth (Fig. 6). We must stop treating these issues as isolated\nchallenges, and establish a systemic response based on kinship with nature\nthat recognizes Earth as our lifeboat in the cosmic sea of space.\n\nFig. 6.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nTurtle Island. Original art commissioned for this paper, Jay Bowen\n(https://jaybowen-art.com/wordpress/).\n\nCoauthor Jay Bowen, Upper Skagit Elder, explained why North American\nIndigenous Peoples described their North America as \u201cturtle island\u201d (Fig. 6):\n\n> \u201cIt was not understood why the ancestors had referenced it in this way until\n> the pictures of Earth were seen in 1969 from the Apollo Space Mission. The\n> outline of North America resembled a turtle. We had an understanding of the\n> whole Earth even though we lived on only a tiny piece of it. The ancestors\n> understood global society. We understood that Earth was of one family. This\n> family built and strengthened ties through voyaging to engage in trade,\n> cultural exchange, and discovery.\u201d\n\nThere is no guarantee of a just, nourishing, and healthy future for humanity,\nand hope will not catalyze the change we need. That work must fall upon us,\nand it is clear from this review that we are past due for, and critically far\naway from, an appropriate reaction to the global emergency we have created.\n\n## Note\n\na\n\n\u201cEcological overshoot\u201d is defined as depleting essential ecosystems faster\nthan they can regenerate and polluting the ecosphere beyond nature's\nassimilative capacity.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa, School\nof Ocean and Earth Science and Technology.
