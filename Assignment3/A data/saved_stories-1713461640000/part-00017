It will indicate when they are \u201conline\u201d, or if\nthey are \u201ctyping...\u201d.\n\nUntil recently, those messages did not include a capital letter. But in recent\ndays, some users have found that the first letters of those messages have been\nswapped for capitals.\n\nThe change appears to have happened on both Android and iOS, though it does\nnot appear to have happened to everyone using the app, and does not yet appear\nto have rolled out to the web and desktop versions. Some found that it\nappeared to have changed on one device but not on others.\n\nWhatsApp often rolls out changes \u2013 both large and small \u2013 over a matter of\nweeks, and so the new indicator may come to other users soon.\n\nMany appeared outrage by the change. Most were not upset by the new look\nitself, but by the fact it had changed at all.\n\nOne post on X/Twitter, which has since been reshared more than 1,600 times,\nappeared to channel the outrage.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp changing the online status from online to Online has sent me\nwest.......why upset me like this,\u201d it read.\n\nWhatsApp did not immediately respond to questions about the change.\n\nOther apps are not consistent on whether the word should be capitalised or\nnot. On Meta\u2019s other major chat platform Facebook Messenger, for instance, the\nonline indicator is capitalised; while on rival Telegram, it is not.\n\n## Join our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see\ntheir replies\n\nComments\n\n### 1/1People outraged after WhatsApp makes tiny change to design\n\n### People outraged after WhatsApp makes tiny change to design\n\nAFP via Getty Images\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
