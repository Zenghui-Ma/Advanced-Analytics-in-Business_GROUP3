And now, somewhere in the\n> back of your tiny brain, you think that Japanese would be a good language to\n> learn. Hey, you could translate video games! Or Manga! Or even Anime! Pick\n> up Japanese girls, impress your friends! Maybe you'll even go to Japan and\n> become an anime artist! Yeah! Sounds like a great idea!So you head down to\n> the library, pick up some books with titles like \"How To Teach Yourself\n> Japanese In Just 5 Seconds A Day While Driving Your Car To And From The Post\n> Office\" and \"Japanese For Complete And Total, Utter Fools Who Should Never\n> Procreate\". Hey, you already know a few words from your manga\n> collection/girlfriend/anime. Excited and impressed with your new knowledge,\n> you begin to think: \"Hey. Maybe, just maybe, I could do this for a living!\n> Or even major in Japanese! Great Idea, Right?\n>\n> ### WRONG.\n>\n> I don't care how many anime tapes you've watched, how many Japanese\n> girlfriends you've had, or books you've read, you don't know Japanese. Not\n> only that, majoring in the godforsaken language is NOT fun or even remotely\n> sensible. Iraqi war prisoners are often forced to major in Japanese. The\n> term \"Holocaust\" comes from the Latin roots \"Holi\" and \"Causem\", meaning \"to\n> major in Japanese\". You get the idea.And so, sick of seeing so many lambs\n> run eagerly to the slaughter, I have created This Guide to REAL TIPS for\n> Studying Japanese. Or, as is actually the case, NOT studying it.This should\n> be obvious.Despite what many language books, friends, or online tutorials\n> may have told you, Japanese is NOT simple, easy, or even sensical (Japanese\n> vocabulary is determined by throwing tiny pieces of sushi at a dart board\n> with several random syllables attatched to it). The Japanese spread these\n> rumours to draw foolish Gaijin into their clutches.Not only is it not\n> simple, it's probably one of the hardest languages you could ever want to\n> learn. With THREE completely different written languages (none of which make\n> sense), a multitude of useless, confusing politeness levels, and an\n> absolutely insane grammatical structure, Japanese has been crushing the\n> souls of the pathetic Gaijin since it's conception. Let's go over some of\n> these elements mentioned above so you can get a better idea of what I\n> mean.The Japanese Writing SystemThe Japanese writing system is broken down\n> into three separate, complete, and insane, parts: Hiragana (\"those squiggly\n> letters\"), Katakana (\"those boxy letters\") and Kanji (\"roughly 4 million\n> embodiments of your worst nightmares\").Hiragana is used to spell out\n> Japanese words using syllables. It consist of many letters, all of which\n> look completely different and bear absolutely no resemblance to each other\n> whatsoever. Hiragana were developed by having a bunch of completely blind,\n> deaf, and dumb Japanese people scribble things on pieces of paper while\n> having no idea why they were doing so. The resulting designs were then\n> called \"hiragana\". The prince who invented these characters, Yorimushi\n> (\"stinking monkey-bush-donkey\"), was promptly bludgeoned to death. But don't\n> worry, because you'll hardly use hiragana in \"real life\".Katakana are used\n> only to spell out foreign words in a thick, crippling Japanese accent, so\n> that you'll have no idea what you're saying even though it's in English.\n> However, if you remember one simple rule for katakana, you'll find reading\n> Japanese much easier: whenever something is written in katakana, it's an\n> English word! (note: Katakana is also used for non-English foreign words.\n> And sound effects, and Japanese words). Katakana all look exactly the same,\n> and it's impossible, even for Japanese people, to tell them apart. No need\n> to worry, because you'll hardly ever have to read katakana in \"real\n> life\".Kanji are letters that were stolen from China. Every time the Japanese\n> invaded China (which was very often) they'd just take a few more letters, so\n> now they have an estimated 400 gazillion of them. Kanji each consist of\n> several \"strokes\", which must be written in a specific order, and convey a\n> specific meaning, like \"horse\", or \"girl\". Not only that, but Kanji can be\n> combined to form new words. For example, if you combine the Kanji for\n> \"small\" and \"woman\", you get the word \"carburetor\". Kanji also have\n> different pronounciations depending on where they are in the word, how old\n> you are, and what day it is. When European settlers first came upon Japan,\n> the Japanese scholars suggested that Europe adopt the Japanese written\n> language as a \"universal\" language understood by all parties. This was the\n> cause of World War 2 several years later. Don't worry, however, since you'll\n> never have to use kanji in \"real life\", since most Japanese gave up on\n> reading a long, long time ago, and now spend most of their time playing\n> Pokemon.Politeness LevelsPolitness Levels have their root in an ancient\n> Japanese tradition of absolute obedience and conformity, a social caste\n> system, and complete respect for arbitrary hierarchical authority, which\n> many American companies believe will be very helpful when applied as\n> managerial techniques. They're right, of course, but no one is very happy\n> about it.Depending on who you are speaking to your politeness level will be\n> very different. Politeness depends on many things, such as age of the\n> speaker, age of the person being spoken to, time of day, zodiac sign, blood\n> type, sex, whether they are Grass or Rock Pokemon type, color of pants, and\n> so on. For an example of Politeness Levels in action, see the example\n> below.Japanese Teacher: Good morning, Harry. Harry: Good Morning. Japanese\n> Classmates: (gasps of horror and shock)The bottom line is that Politeness\n> Levels are completely beyond your understanding, so don't even try. Just\n> resign yourself to talking like a little girl for the rest of your life and\n> hope to God that no one beats you up.Grammatical StructureThe Japanese have\n> what could be called an \"interesting\" grammatical structure, but could also\n> be called \"confusing\", \"random\", \"bogus\" or \"evil\". To truly understand\n> this, let's examine the differences between Japanese and English\n> grammar.English Sentence: Jane went to the school.Same Sentence In Japanese:\n> School Jane To Went Monkey Apple Carburetor.Japanese grammar is not for the\n> faint of heart or weak of mind. What's more, the Japanese also do not have\n> any words for \"me\", \"them\", \"him, or \"her\" that anyone could use without\n> being incredibly insulting (the Japanese word for \"you\", for example, when\n> written in kanji, translates to\"I hope a monkey scratches your face off\").\n> Because of this, the sentences \"He just killed her!\" and \"I just killed\n> her!\" sound exactly the same, meaning that most people in Japan have no idea\n> what is going on around them at any given moment. You are supposed to figure\n> these things out from the \"context\", which is a German word meaning \"you're\n> screwed\".When most Americans think of Japanese people, they think: polite,\n> respectful, accomodating. (They could also possibly think: Chinese).\n> However, it is important to learn where the truth ends and our Western\n> stereotyping begins.Of course, it would be irresponsible of me to make any\n> sweeping generalizations about such a large group of people, but ALL\n> Japanese people have three characteristics: they \"speak\" English, they dress\n> very nicely, and they're short.The Japanese school system is controlled by\n> Japan's central government which, of course, is not biased in any way\n> (recent Japanese history textbook title: \"White Demons Attempt To Take Away\n> Our Holy Motherland, But Great And Powerful Father-Emperor Deflects Them\n> With Winds From God: The Story Of WW2\"). Because of this, all Japanese have\n> been taught the same English-language course, which consists of reading The\n> Canterbury Tales, watching several episodes of M*A*S*H and reading the\n> English dictionary from cover to cover. Armed with this extensive language\n> knowledge, the children of Japan emerge from school ready to take part in\n> international business and affairs, uttering such remarkable and memorable\n> sentences as \"You have no chance to survive make your time\", and adding to\n> their own products by inscribing English slogans, such as \"Just give this a\n> Paul. It may be the Paul of your life\" on the side of a slot\n> machine.Secondly, all Japanese people dress extremely well. This fits in\n> with the larger Japanese attitude of neatness and order. Everything has to\n> be in its correct place with the Japanese, or a small section in the right\n> lobe of their brain begins to have seizures and they exhibit erratic violent\n> behavior until the messiness is eradicated. The Japanese even FOLD THEIR\n> DIRTY CLOTHES. Sloppiness is not tolerated in Japanese society, and someone\n> with a small wrinkle in their shirt, which they thought they could hide by\n> wearing a hooded sweatshirt over it (possibly emblazoned with a catchy\n> English phrase like \"Spread Beaver, Violence Jack-Off!\"), will be promptly\n> beaten to death with tiny cellular phones.Lastly, the Japanese are all\n> short. Really, really short. It's kind of funny. Not ones to leave being\n> tall to the Europeans or Africans, however, the Japanese have singlehandedly\n> brought shoes with incredibly gigantic soles into style, so that they can\n> finally appear to be of actual human height, when in reality their height\n> suggests that they may indeed be closer in relation to the race of dwarves\n> or hobbits.Japanese culture is also very \"interesting\", by which we mean\n> \"confusing\" and in several cases \"dangerous\". Their culture is based on the\n> concept of \"In Group/Out Group\", in which all Japanese people are one big\n> \"In\" group, and YOU are the \"Out\" group. Besides this sense of alienation,\n> Japan also produces cartoons, and a wide variety of other consumer products\n> which are crammed into your face 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The\n> Japanese also like cock fighting monsters that live in your pants, taking\n> baths with the elderly, and killing themselves.Japanese food is what some\n> people would call \"exotic\", but what most people call \"disgusting\", or\n> perhaps, in some areas, \"whack\". Japanese food evolved in ancient days, when\n> the main staple of the diet was rice. People got so sick and tired of eating\n> rice, in fact, that they ate just about anything else they could find, from\n> seaweed to other Japanese people. This has led to the creation of such\n> wonderful foods as \"natto\", which I believe is a kind of bean but tastes\n> like battery acid, and \"Pocky\", which is a stick with different frostings on\n> it, the flavors of which include Sawdust and Strawberry.Despite this variety\n> of foods, however, the Japanese have succeeded in making every single thing\n> they eat, from tea to plums, taste like smokey beef.As if learning the\n> language wasn't hard enough, Japanese classes in America tend to attract the\n> kind of student who makes you wish that a large comet would strike the\n> earth. There are a few basic types of students that you'll always find\n> yourself running into. These include The Anime Freak, The Know It All, and\n> the Deer Caught In Headlights.The Anime Freak is probably the most common,\n> and one of the most annoying. You can usually spot a few warning signs to\n> let you identify them before it's too late: they wear the same exact\n> Evangelion shirt every day, they have more than one anime key chain on their\n> person, they wear glasses, they say phrases in Japanese that they obviously\n> don't understand (such as \"Yes! I will never forgive you!\"), they refer to\n> you as \"-chan\", make obscure Japanese culture references during class, and\n> usually fail class. You have to be extremely careful not to let them smell\n> pity or fear on you, because if they do they will immediately latch onto you\n> and suck up both your time and patience, leaving only a lifeless husk.\n> Desperate for human companionship, they will invite you to club meetings,\n> anime showings, conventions, and all other sorts of various things you don't\n> care about.The Know It All typically has a Japanese girlfriend or boyfriend,\n> and because of this \"inside source\" on Japanese culture, has suddenly become\n> an academic expert on all things Japanese, without ever having read a single\n> book on Japan in their entire lives. You can usually spot Know It All's by\n> keeping an eye out for these warning signs: a cocky smile, answering more\n> than their share of questions, getting most questions wrong, questioning the\n> teacher on various subjects and then arguing about the answers (a typical\n> exchange: Student: What does \"ohayoo\" mean?,Teacher: It means \"good\n> morning\", Student: That's not what my girlfriend said...), being wrong,\n> talking alot about Japanese food and being wrong, giving long, unnecessarily\n> detailed answers which are wrong, and failing class.The Deer Caught In\n> Headlights are those students who took Japanese because either a.) they\n> thought it sounded like fun, b.) they thought it would be easy, or c.) they\n> just need a couple more credits to graduate. These students wear a mask of\n> terror and panic from the moment they walk into class till the moment they\n> leave, because all they can hear inside their heads is the high pitched\n> scream their future is making as it is flushed down the toilet. They are\n> usually failing.Although many of Japanese-language students are smart,\n> funny, hard working people, none of them will be in your class.If you can\n> get past the difficulty, society, and classmates, you will probably find\n> Japanese to be a fun, rewarding language to learn. We wouldn't know,\n> however, since no one has ever gotten that far. But hey, I'm sure you're\n> different.Author's Note:This whole essay, although sprinkled with truisms\n> here and there, is a joke and should be taken as one. I'm actually a\n> Japanese major myself, and even if I've given it a bit of a hard time, I\n> love the Japanese language, and I think everyone should give it a try.You\n> should just be ready for a whole lot of pain.HAPPY LANGUAGE LEARNING!\\- Dan\n> Barrett  \n  \n---\n\n", "frontpage": false}
