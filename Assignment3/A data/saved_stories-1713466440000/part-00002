Among the usual drivers and bug fixes, it contains\nsome more tweaks for bcachefs, as well as some mitigations against the\nrecently-uncovered Spectre-style Native Branch History Injection data leaks.\n\nHowever, the change that brought the most amusement to the face of the Reg\nFOSS desk is a configuration file change from Linus himself, titled \"Kconfig:\nadd some hidden tabs on purpose.\" He switched a space indent to a tab indent\nto catch out poor-quality parsers.\n\nSpecifically, in this block of text in the kernel source...\n\n    \n    \n    default 12 if PAGE_SIZE_4KB default 13 if PAGE_SIZE_8KB default 14 if PAGE_SIZE_16KB default 15 if PAGE_SIZE_32KB default 16 if PAGE_SIZE_64KB default 18 if PAGE_SIZE_256KB\n\n...the character between default and the integer value is now an eight-\ncharacter-wide tab indentation. It just happens to fall on the end of a tab\nboundary so it appears as one space character.\n\nWhile Torvalds is famed for his robust approach to giving feedback in public,\nhe has been working on it, and in 2018 took a break to help him to get the\nemotions in his emails under better control.\n\nThis change could be one example of this. The kernel commandant spotted one\nparticular code change, commit d96c36004e31 which had a single purpose:\n\nFix FTRACE_RECORD_RECURSION_SIZE entry, replace tab with a space character. It\nhelps Kconfig parsers to read file without error.\n\nKconfig is the configuration language used to control the kernel build system,\nand like many other off-side rule languages, it uses indentation to delimit\nblocks. Yes, significant whitespace, just like in Python, YAML, and many other\nprogramming and configuration languages. Love it or hate it, you can't escape\nit.\n\nIn this change, he is intentionally making the use of indentation in kernel\nbuild configuration files more complicated, in order to force the authors of\ntools which parse such files to improve their game. As he explains:\n\nLet's make sure it gets fixed. Because if you can't parse tabs as whitespace,\nyou should not be parsing the kernel Kconfig files.\n\nThis seems to us to be an instance of Postel's Law, which Postel enshrined in\nRFC 761 in 1980: Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you\nsend. Many indentation-marked languages have a recommended style, such as\nPython's PEP-008, which says very clearly and distinctly:\n\nUse 4 spaces per indentation level.\n\nBut in fact, although the specification is strict, the interpreter will\nhappily accept different numbers of spaces, or tabs in some lines and spaces\nin others, so long as developers are consistent about how they use them. This\nis what Linus wants to see, and he quite rightly regards as broken whatever\nparsing tool it was that failed when it encountered tabs instead of spaces.\n\n  * Linux 6.9 will be the first to top ten million Git objects\n  * Linus Torvalds flames Google kernel contributor over filesystem suggestion\n  * Long-term support for Linux kernels is about to get a lot shorter\n  * Fed-up Torvalds suggests disabling AMD's 'stupid' performance-killing fTPM RNG\n  * Linux has nearly half of the desktop OS Linux market\n\nSo, rather than a savagely critical email response, he is knowingly and with\nmalice aforethought using more complicated indentation in order to expose\ntools that can't handle it. It should weed out the weaker tools, leaving only\nthe fitter, better-adapted ones... while not publicly hurting anyone's\nfeelings.\n\nThink of it as evolution in action. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * API\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Fedora\n  * FOSDEM\n  * Git\n  * GNOME\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * Software bug\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Operating System\n\n#### More about\n\n87 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * API\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Fedora\n  * FOSDEM\n  * Git\n  * GNOME\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * Software bug\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Operating System\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware14 days | 184\n\n#### Malicious xz backdoor reveals fragility of open source\n\nAnalysis This time, we got lucky.
