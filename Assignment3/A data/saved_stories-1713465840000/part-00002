The picture of Ronald\nReagan peering into a child\u2019s messy bedroom\u2014which I\u2019m now realising, as I\ntype, is mildly sinister?\u2014is in fact, believe it or not, two photos mashed\ntogether1. Both are from Getty who I\u2019m sure won\u2019t mind.\n\nAs one would expect, Ronald Reagan was the recipient of thousands of letters\neach month during his presidency; a mailbag so voluminous, in fact, that a\ngang of patient volunteers were tasked with opening them all on his behalf and\npassing him approximately 30 each week to read and respond to. Letters arrived\nfrom all over the world, written by a diverse group of people: men, women,\nfans, critics, average Joes, celebrities, world leaders, and, marking a moment\nin history, a letter from a 13-year-old boy from South Carolina named Andy\nSmith, written exactly 40 years ago on 18 April 1984.\n\nAndy Smith to U.S. President Ronald Reagan, 18th April 1984\n\n> Andy Smith 400 London Pride Road Irmo, South Carolina 29063\n>\n> April 18, 1984\n>\n> Dear Mr. President,\n>\n> My name is Andy Smith. I am a seventh grade student at Irmo Middle School,\n> in Irmo, South Carolina.\n>\n> Today my mother declared my bedroom a disaster area. I would like to request\n> federal funds to hire a crew to clean up my room. I am prepared to provide\n> the initial funds if you will provide matching funds for this project.\n>\n> I know you will be fair when you consider my request. I will be awaiting\n> your reply.\n>\n> Sincerely yours, Andy Smith\n\n> May 11, 1984\n>\n> Dear Andy:\n>\n> I\u2019m sorry to be so late in answering your letter but, as you know, I\u2019ve been\n> in China and found your letter here upon my return.\n>\n> Your application for disaster relief has been duly noted but I must point\n> out one technical problem: the authority declaring the disaster is supposed\n> to make the request. In this case, your mother.\n>\n> However, setting that aside, I\u2019ll have to point out the larger problem of\n> available funds. This has been a year of disasters: 539 hurricanes as of May\n> 4th and several more since, numerous floods, forest fires, drought in Texas\n> and a number of earthquakes. What I\u2019m getting at is that funds are\n> dangerously low.\n>\n> May I make a suggestion? This Administration, believing that government has\n> done many things that could better be done by volunteers at the local level,\n> has sponsored a Private Sector Initiative Program, calling upon people to\n> practice voluntarism in the solving of a number of local problems.\n>\n> Your situation appears to be a natural. I\u2019m sure your mother was fully\n> justified in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you are in an\n> excellent position to launch another volunteer program to go along with the\n> more than 3000 already underway in our nation. Congratulations.\n>\n> Give my best regards to your mother.\n>\n> Sincerely, Ronald Reagan\n\n1\n\nBefore you ask about my photo manipulation training: I\u2019m self-taught.\n\n### Subscribe to Letters of Note\n\nBy Shaun Usher\n\nNothing but history's most interesting letters.\n\n31 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n31\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My mother declared my bedroom a disaster area\n\nnews.lettersofnote.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nAshley SouthScratching the Surface2 hrs agoIt pains me to like anything with R\nRegan's name on it, but that's a witty, ideologically impeccable (nice\nmetaphor, with a tip of the conservative hat at the end), oddly tender and\nironically generous reply.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nDenise Lindgren McCabeDenise\u2019s Substack1 hr agoVery funny, and makes me have\nmore respect for Reagan (just a little more mind you...)Expand full\ncommentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nTHIS IS INSTEAD OF TELEPHONING BECAUSE I CANT LOOK YOU IN THE VOICE\n\nOn this day in 1945, Dorothy Parker had writer's block\n\nJun 28, 2022 \u2022\n\nShaun Usher\n\n53\n\nShare this post\n\n#### THIS IS INSTEAD OF TELEPHONING BECAUSE I CANT LOOK YOU IN THE VOICE\n\nnews.lettersofnote.com\n\n6\n\nI hate everybody including you\n\nThe art of saying no\n\nDec 18, 2020 \u2022\n\nShaun Usher\n\n108\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I hate everybody including you\n\nnews.lettersofnote.com\n\n2\n\nI would like to be paid like a plumber\n\nPitching Nirvana\n\nMar 28, 2022 \u2022\n\nShaun Usher\n\n91\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I would like to be paid like a plumber\n\nnews.lettersofnote.com\n\n12\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Letters of Note\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
