I grew up in a\ncultural stew with a Spanish-French mother, a Colombian-born American father,\nand an Argentine stepmother. Whether at my mother or father\u2019s home, I was\nimmersed in a blend of languages, accents, and traditions.\n\nMy parents briefly considered naming me Violette, a French name to match my\nmother\u2019s first language, but instead I was named after a\nmountain\u2014Montserrat\u2014just outside Barcelona, Spain, where I spent my early\nchildhood. After my French great-grandmother Andr\u00e9e prematurely gave birth to\nmy grandmother and her twin sister at six months, she went to the serrated\nmountains to pray to the Virgin of Montserrat, the patron saint of Catalonia,\nas her babies fought for their lives. The choir boys might have been singing.\nShe must have lit a vela among hundreds of candles already lit, a peseta for a\nprayer. When her daughters recovered, she gave them twin middle names:\nMontserrat, after the Virgin who she believed had saved them.\n\nSeven years later, during the Spanish Civil War, my great-grandmother, my\ngrandmother Odette, and her twin sister Yvette fled to France. There, they\nwould be separated. Odette, staying with the French side of the family, only\nspoke French, Spanish slowly slipping to become her secondary language.\nYvette, living with the Spanish side of the family, spoke primarily Spanish.\nMy late grandmother\u2019s Spanish was forever French-accented. Her sister, now 95,\nstill speaks her Spanish with a French accent. What does it feel like to speak\nyour primary language in an accent from your secondary one? I would later find\nout.\n\n> At 5, I spoke all these languages fluently. Today, I only speak two of them,\n> but understand all of them in some way, as they still live inside me.\n\nLike my grandmother, I too was 7 when I left Spain for another country. As I\nsettled into a new life in the US, I learned to change the pronunciation of my\nname to make it easier on my teachers and peers and to avoid embarrassing\nmispronunciations. Mon-sea. Telling my friends back in Spain about this, they\nthink it\u2019s cute: que mono! When I moved from Barcelona to Brattleboro,\nVermont, with my parents, I started first grade with a thick Spanish accent.\nHow adorable, people remarked to my father about my foreign accent. To\nassimilate, I worked to lose it as quickly as possible. Eventually, I\u2019d swap\naccents like clothes\u2014growing out of one and into another. Today, I speak\nSpanish with a slight slip of an American accent. It makes me feel like an\noutsider in my own family.\n\nIn Vermont, and later Boston, we celebrated all the Spanish holidays\u2014holidays\nthat held more familiarity to me than the American ones. On New Year\u2019s Eve we\nstuffed peeled green grapes in our mouths to the crackling countdown on Radio\nNacional de Espa\u00f1a in the background. Every January 6th we gathered around the\ntable to cut the Rosc\u00f3n de Reyes, a brioche cake served on King\u2019s Day in\nSpain, each hoping to find the f\u00e8ve hidden in our piece. We celebrated with\ngolden crowns made from cardboard, flute glasses, and Cava nearby. We received\ngifts on our saint\u2019s days, more so than on birthdays. At home, I was Spanish.\nAt school, American. When mom got angry at us, the ultimate insult would be\nspewed: \u201cAy! That is so American!\u201d But outside of the house, while in the\npresence of my peers, I wanted that to be true. Being so American would mean I\nwould be allowed to wear shorts to school. I would not be asked \u201cwhere are you\nfrom\u201d regularly. I would blend in.\n\nI am boarding the second leg of my flight from the US to Spain. With a hazy\nhead from lack of sleep, I hear the flight attendant greet me as I step onto\nthe plane. \u201cHola!\u201d she says in a sing-songy voice, and I find myself slipping\ninto the reality of my \u201cother\u201d self: more animated than I was a day ago,\nturning the excitement up a notch as if I were reuniting with a cherished\nfriend I hadn\u2019t seen in years. It is when I get to speak jugo de naranja por\nfavor out loud, instead of just water please, which I said six hours ago. And\nalso when the flight crew announces the safety instructions first in Spanish\nand then in English. In this space, I feel these two parts of me merging for a\nbrief few hours. As I arrive at El Prat, Barcelona\u2019s international airport\nwith floor-to-wall windows that shimmer in the sun, I\u2019ll hear my name and turn\naround for a moment, forgetting there are many Montses here. I\u2019ll breathe in\nthe language of my childhood being spoken all around me and exhale a sense of\nbelonging.\n\nBefore I make my way to the welcome embrace of family, there is a long line\nthrough customs. It\u2019s a familiar routine. I hand over my blue passport and the\nagent looks at my name and then at me: \u201cPero porque tienes un nombre Catalan?\u201d\nhe will ask, somewhat perplexed. I mention that I am half Spanish: \u201cSoy media\nEspa\u00f1ola.\u201d This is the short answer.\n\nTo speak my name out loud feels vastly different depending on where I\u2019m\nstanding. In the US, my insides splinter right before I open my mouth. Will\nthe person laugh? Grossly mispronounce it? Misspell it? Insist that my name is\nnot Spanish, it\u2019s French? Or ask the most Frequently Asked Question of all:\n\u201cBut what is your first name?\u201d\n\nWhen I was a girl, my grandmother called me Aht because as I was learning to\nspeak, even I couldn\u2019t say the first part of my name. Now, when I introduce\nmyself to someone, I notice how often I soften the edges of that last\nsyllable, how I say my name as if it were a question. As if to say: Are you\nuncomfortable? Let me help.\n\nAt a caf\u00e9 in Portland, Oregon, I wait to pick up my order. \u201cMonster . . .\u201d\nPause. \u201cRAT. \u201d I see him, the caf\u00e9 owner among the chefs, but he doesn\u2019t see\nme. He has mined and rearranged the letters in my name to find the ugliest\nwords in English. When he hands me my bag and mispronounces my name again (not\nquite as exaggerated when he was doing it for an audience), I curtly correct\nhim.\n\n\u201cMontse-rraht,\u201d I say, with an emphasis on the rolling Rs.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s beautiful.\u201d His tune has changed, but I give him no grace\u2014only a\nfaint \u201cthanks\u201d tossed into the air. He has brought out a monster in me, I\nthink.\n\n> Her first name is markedly American, whereas mine, Spanish. She grew up\n> (mostly) in Spain, I grew up (mostly) in the US. We were a coin toss: hers\n> fell one way, mine the other.\n\nIn my New England middle school, I fantasized about changing my name to\nMonica. Just three tiny letters changed and I would never again see the\nteacher\u2019s finger linger on the class roster\u2014that long pause after \u201cSarah\u201d and\nbefore \u201cAlex\u201d would not be a familiar one. Besides, I have a childhood friend\nin Barcelona named Monica. Yes, Monica. A name that will make me belong in\nboth places, I believed.\n\nWhen I meet young children in the US with parents like mine, who gifted them\nnames to match their origins, I wonder if they too recoil when hearing the\nclass roll call. If, as adults, they will also feel misunderstood by their\nadopted country. \u201cI love your name,\u201d I make sure to tell them. I want them to\nfeel special instead of unusual. To not take decades to (re)claim the\nbeautiful complexity of their multiple identities. To believe their father\nwhen he says, like mine did, \u201cTrust me, you\u2019ll appreciate your name one day.\u201d\n\nIn a Lyft in Los Angeles, my driver, originally from Mexico, tells me his\ndaughter, too, is named Montserrat. I light up. \u201cReally?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but she hates her name and makes us call her by her middle name,\u201d he\nsays as I watch the cross sway from the rearview mirror. Please tell her, I\nsay, that you met someone today named Montserrat, who also didn\u2019t like her\nname when she was a girl\u2014but who now says it proudly.\n\nIn the US, when someone cares, when they actually want to know how to spell\nit, or where it comes from, or how to pronounce it, I will ease into the\nspelling, not exaggerate the rolling of my Rs. I will pinch my fingers\ntogether and conduct the letters of my name as if it were a score, or point\nthem as if I were dipping a thin brush in vibrant color, painting on a canvas.\nI will take my time, because I no longer want to share a watered-down version\nof the name that runs through my lineage.\n\nI walk into a caf\u00e9 in Barrio G\u00f3tico and before I say a word, the hostess says,\n\u201cHello, what would you like?\u201d in English decorated in a Spanish accent. She is\nused to seeing more tourists than locals through these doors. I wish to tell\nher: I know your language\u2014it was once mine. I knew these streets before I knew\nany others. To convey something of this, I say instead, \u201cBuenas! Un cortado\npor favor,\u201d letting her know she doesn\u2019t have to speak a foreign language with\nme.\n\nHer shoulders loosen and a smile curls on her face. \u201cAh, claro!\u201d\n\nHow did she know I don\u2019t really belong here anymore? Is it my clothes or\nhaircut? The way I walk? What tells her I am no longer a Spaniard? If my\nsister Claudia, who has stronger Spanish features, walked in, would the\nhostess have greeted her differently? If I never moved from Spain as a girl,\nwould I still be perceived as American?\n\n## Help us fund our next story\n\nWe\u2019ve published hundreds of original stories, all funded by you \u2014 including\npersonal essays, reported features, and reading lists.\n\nBecome a member\n\nThere is a bakery in Dei\u00e0, Mallorca, where I have been going since I was a\nlittle girl. Where the panadera will wrap my ensa\u00efmadas in thin paper, passing\nthem to me with hands dusted in powdered sugar. On a recent visit, I met a new\npanadera. I surmise we are around the same age. Every morning we exchange que\ntal estas and wish each other a good day after I put my euro on the counter.\nOne of these mornings, I hear her speak in flawless English to a British\ncustomer. So, I hand over my own: \u201cYou speak perfect English!\u201d She is\nAmerican, she tells me. Her mother is Spanish, from Soller, it turns out, and\nher father is from California. Her first name is markedly American, whereas\nmine, Spanish. She grew up (mostly) in Spain, I grew up (mostly) in the US. We\nwere a coin toss: hers fell one way, mine the other. What would my life have\nbeen if I hadn\u2019t left Spain as a child? What would hers have been if she\nhadn\u2019t left the US? Aside from not experiencing embarrassing roll calls at\nschool, how else might our lives have unfolded? I want to ask her so many\nquestions, but there is a long line wrapped around the store. It is tourist\nseason.\n\nSometimes there is a fluidity between my languages that I cannot control. No\nmatter where I am in the world, if I\u2019m sleepy, I might catch myself saying,\n\u201cOuf, I\u2019m cansadisima.\u201d When I step on something slimy with bare feet, I\u2019ll\nlikely utter \u201cahh, que aaasco!\u201d rather than \u201cgross!\u201d But also, in Spain\u2014when\nwe are long past sobremesa and the plates and wine glasses have been\ncleared\u2014English will undoubtedly creep into a sentence in Spanish, too. Yes\ninstead of si. Of course instead of claro.\n\nWhat would it be to accept this blending of language as part of me, instead of\nfighting against it? Maybe I jumble these words because that\u2019s what the brain\ndoes. Sort of like calling one child by another\u2019s name by mistake. But I\nwonder: what if these words slip out unconsciously because they feel more\nauthentic to me in Spanish than how they feel in English, or vice versa?\n\nI learn from my father that our first language is stored in a different part\nof the brain. His first and only language until age 7 was Spanish. Born in\nBogot\u00e1, Colombia, he lived in a casa in the barrio Chapinero with pet ocelots,\ndeer, and his parents, both journalists. They were bilingual, but inside and\noutside the walls of his home, Spanish was all he heard.\n\nIn my mother\u2019s upbringing, however, three languages were in rotation. To her\nmother she spoke Spanish, to her father French, and to her sister English. At\nthe dinner table, when they were all together, they spoke French.\n\n\u201cWhat was your first language?\u201d For many people, this is a question with a\nsimple answer. But in my case, it\u2019s not so clear. Unlike my father\u2019s parents,\nmine did not worry about blending languages around me. I heard a trifecta of\nEnglish, Spanish, and French at home, and Catalan at school. It was: Hi kiddo!\nHola guapa. Look at the minou. Besos. Bisous. Kisses. Felicidades! Je t\u2019aime\nchouchou. See you later. Ad\u00e9u!\n\nI have since lost most of my French and Catalan, and now as an adult, I make\nminor mistakes when speaking in Spanish. I often must search my mind, as if\nconsulting a map for a neighborhood I used to live in, for the correct Spanish\nverb, or might be corrected when I say que tengas un buen noche by mistake\ninstead of una buena noche. Once, after a cold, I lost my voice completely for\nsix full days. Not even a whisper made its way out. I used exaggerated facial\nexpressions and hand motions, gesturing toward salt shakers and doors to speak\nthe language I felt but couldn\u2019t voice. This is how it feels to sit around a\nfamily table where people are speaking French or Catalan. Like I\u2019m holding a\nkey that fits into a lock, but struggles to turn.\n\nWhen my father\u2019s parents left Colombia, they landed on the bustling streets of\nNew York City, swapping el Chapinero for the Upper West Side. Not speaking a\nword of English, my father became mute for half a year. Among his most vivid\nmemories is Antonio, a friend who was Italian and the only kid with whom he\ncould communicate in school. They cobbled together a language between Italian\nand Spanish that became their own. When Antonio couldn\u2019t go to my dad\u2019s\nbirthday party, my dad no longer wanted to celebrate. He preferred being alone\ninstead of experiencing the discomfort of not having the words to communicate.\n\nToday, my dad speaks perfect English and Spanish, along with Portuguese, but\nthe way these languages live in him is not the same. He has always sensed that\nhe expresses and carries himself differently depending on which language he\nspeaks. Some years ago, when he was featured in a video for a nonprofit that\npromotes cross-cultural communication, that distinction became clear. They\nproduced the video in both English and Spanish, and he tells me that when they\nfilmed the English version, the producer told him to relax\u2014to be less cerebral\nand to let things flow. There were a lot of retakes. But later, under the same\npressure and bright lights, when it was time to do the Spanish version, the\ntwo people directing him were amazed at how much more natural and at ease he\nwas. \u201cThe producer said I seemed like a different person,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWell,\nI guess I was.\u201d\n\n> What does it feel like to speak your primary language in an accent from your\n> secondary one? I would later find out.\n\nWe seek to become the truest version of ourselves, but what if there isn\u2019t one\ntrue version, but multiple? Like father, like daughter, there are two versions\nof me. One stays up late and indulges in wine, daily meriendas, and cheese\nsmothered across pan. She laughs loud and often and a vibrant energy\naccompanies her words. She is spontaneous and playful. But the other version\nis there, too. She covers her mouth when she laughs. She avoids large group\ngatherings, sticks to routines, and eats dinner at 6 p.m. She overthinks and\nworries over her words\u2014and whether she misspeaks or is misunderstood.\n\nI recently spent extended time in Spain and France. One day, I just noticed\nthe duality. Noticed that I let my laughter echo, that I was more expressive\nwith hand gestures when speaking, that I happily indulged in all the things I\ndon\u2019t often allow myself in the US. I was less anxious, and I sunk into a\ngentler part of myself. Does this happen because I\u2019m assimilating to the part\nof my culture that lives an ocean\u2019s length away? In the US, do I worry about\nlaughing loudly lest I disturb someone? Why do I change my name to make others\ncomfortable? Maybe I\u2019m rejecting the culture that often rejects me, and the\nresult is that I become a smaller version of myself.\n\nI\u2019m sitting at a traditional Spanish restaurant with my family in Sitges, a\nbeach town just outside Barcelona. We begin with olivas and some pan con\ntomate\u2013\u2013ripe tomatoes and olive oil drizzled atop thick crusted bread. I gaze\nto my left, my eyes settling on the pebble-lined shores of the Mediterranean.\nI begin to daydream, a favorite pastime, even when I\u2019m in this place of my\ndreams. At the table, I hear the rapid sounds of the language I\u2019d left behind,\nand my family momentarily forgets I am here, slipping from Castellano\n(Spanish) into Catalan. \u201cAy perdona, Montse!\u201d In moments like these, I feel no\nkinship with that young girl who wanted to feel so American. What I don\u2019t say\naloud is how much I love hearing Catalan echo around me. That I understand\nnearly every word, even though I can no longer speak it. As I steep back into\nmy blended world\u2014not quite here, not quite there\u2014I sit and revel in the\nability to eavesdrop on all the conversations around me in Catalan, French,\nEnglish, and Spanish. At 5, I spoke all these languages fluently. Today, I\nonly speak two of them, but understand all of them in some way, as they still\nlive inside me.\n\nI am in Los Angeles, at the Spanish consulate. I am here to get my Spanish\ncitizenship. I slide my papers over to the kind woman behind the glass that\ndivides us. Montse, I hear, muffled, but she is not speaking to me. She turns\nto say something to the older woman next to her. A woman, I realize, who\nshares my name. She looks over my papers carefully, nodding her head as she\ngoes along. Turns them over once, twice. Todo perfecto, she tells me through\nthe tiny microphone on the other end of the glass. Now, she says, they will\nmake me a Spanish birth certificate. As if I am being born again.\n\nOne balmy spring day, I am standing among the Monta\u00f1a de Montserrat, where my\ngreat-grandmother stood all those years ago seeking a miracle. A miracle that\ndelivered, and so the mountain became my namesake. There are few other places\nI feel more at peace than when I am held by these blushed mountains. El aire,\nlas vistas, las sensaciones. The faint sound of Catalan and the choir boys\nsinging in the distance. I look out at the wide expanse, enveloped by these\nmountains, and they feel like my mountains. They are part of me. I feel, at\nleast for a moment, home.\n\nMontserrat Andr\u00e9e Carty is a writer, photographer, and the interviews editor\nfor Hunger Mountain.
