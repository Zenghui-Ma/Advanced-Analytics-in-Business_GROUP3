The\nreservations cost $100 and are refundable until delivery if a customer changes\ntheir mind.\n\nThen in December, the company began inviting customers with a reservation to\nplace a $1,000 deposit for the truck.\n\n## How does the Cybertruck sales compare to other electric trucks?\n\nWhile the number of deliveries revealed by the recall may not be eye popping,\nbeing near the 4,000 vehicles sold benchmark puts Tesla as a strong competitor\nin the domestic electric truck market.\n\nEarlier this month, Ford reported that it had sold 7,743 of its F-150\nLightning electric trucks in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGeneral Motors reported that it sold 1,688 Hummer EVs domestically.\n\nRivian, which sells a truck and an SUV, reported that it delivered 13,588\nvehicles, though it did not provide a breakdown by model. Motor1 reported that\nthe company had sold 2,399 of the R1T truck.\n\n## Cybertruck lynchpin in Musk's vision\n\nMusk has signaled that the electric truck will be a key component of the\ncompany's future.\n\n\"We're likely to do probably a quarter million a year, I think...maybe\nmore...again very much dependent on what the demand is like,\" Musk said at the\ncompany's 2023 annual shareholder meeting, later adding that the company could\ndeliver up to 500,000 trucks.\n\nElektrek reported that suppliers were asked to plan for an annual production\nvolume of at least 375,000 Cybertrucks.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote on his Medium page in\nOctober that he believes the company could deliver between 240,000 and 260,000\nCybertrucks by the end of 2025.\n\n## Analysts see Cybertruck as 'another black eye'\n\nThe recall is the latest burner of brand equity for the company, analysts\nsaid, adding to a string of negative press.\n\n\"This is another black eye for Tesla, which has added to the chaos going on\nfor Musk,\u201d Dan Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told The\nGuardian. \u201cCybertruck is the pedestal moment and a recall out of the gates is\na bad look.\u201d\n\nThe chatoic week that surrounded the recall seemed to crystalize the larger\nheadwinds that surround the company.\n\nSome of those headwinds are self-inflicted including: Musk's erratic behavior,\nhis management of the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter and\nsafety questions and delays around the company's Full Self Driving technology.\n\nTesla's electric vehicle perch is also threatened by the proliferation of\ncompetition, especially from Chinese automakers, and a softer EV market\noverall.\n\nWhile the stumble of the Cybertruck has not helped the perception of the\ncompany, analyst concerns around the business stretch wider than the angular\nvehicle.\n\n\"While it deserves credit for becoming the charging network of choice by many\nEV makers in the U.S., its Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has\nstalled, while its gross margin for Services remains stuck in the low-single-\ndigits,\" Sean Williams wrote for the Motley Fool. \"Tesla's sales and\nprofitability are dependent on its ability to sell and lease EVs \u2013 and that's\na segment that's under serious pressure right now.\"\n\n## Tesla stock price\n\nTesla's stock closed Monday at $142.05, down 3.4%.\n\nThe company will share its first quarter earnings after market close on\nTuesday.\n\nSMS Facebook Twitter Email\n\nShare your feedback to help improve our site!\n\nShare your feedback to help improve our site!\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Subscription Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Site Map\n  * Accessibility\n  * Our Ethical Principles\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024\n\n## About Your Privacy\n\nClicking on the \"Reject All\" Button retains the default setting of only\nstrictly necessary cookies.\n\nWe and our 71 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
