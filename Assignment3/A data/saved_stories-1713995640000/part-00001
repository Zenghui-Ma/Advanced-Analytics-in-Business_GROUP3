A special date\nbecause...it's a palindrome. (Umm, why else would it be special?)\n\nThis was also a neat opportunity to show how a volatility risk premium can\nnormalize from extremely high levels.\n\n####\n\nA Demonstration of VRP Normalizing\n\nOne of http://moontower.ai's \"top of funnel\" charts is the REAL chart -- a\nscatterplot of VRP (volatility risk premium) vs realized vol percentile.\n\nWe are going Monday morning the chart to show how BTC implied volatility\nanticipated the last month's moves while also being \"overpriced\".\n\nFirst a refresher on the http://moontower.ai Real chart:\n\n1) The y-axis plots the VRP defined as 1-month IV / trailing 30 day realized\n\n2) X-axis is the percentile of 30 day realized compared to its own history. So\na 20% VRP means that IV is 120% of trailing realized (ie 24% IV vs 20% RV). If\nthe RV percentile is 80% then that means the realized vol is in the top 20% of\nhistorical realized vols (1 year history)\n\nThis is an example of the chart from today:\n\nChart Intuition\n\nMarkets typically expect IVs to mean revert.\n\nWhen realized vol is very low (think 2017 when SPY was realizing like 6% vol\nand option traders were lamenting their career choice) VRP will look fat. IV\nmight be 8% in such a world, so a VRP of 33%!\n\nThe market's pricing of IV is not extrapolating that low RV to persist .\n\n[This is why IV tends to have a tighter range than RV...IVs will discount\nextreme RVs in both directions].\n\nThis does not suggest an easy trade.\n\nYou are welcome to harvest that premium by selling vol at 8% but you are\nselling a number that itself has positive skew so the expectancy and hit rate\nwill diverge.\n\nVRPs are good \"top of funnel\" measures but it's worth noting the 2 failure\nmodes (false positives and false negatives of VRP or IV/RV ratios)\n\nFrom moontower.ai tooltip\n\nWhen you sell a fat VRP ratio you are anticipating the ratio to fall.\n\nHow it falls determines if you'll make $$.\n\n  1. If it falls because the numerator collapses (IV falls) faster than the denominator than you likely won.\n\n  2. If the ratio falls because the denominator (realized vol) catches up to the numerator you probably lose.\n\nSo one thing we like to do is examine the Real chart for a single asset.\n\nWe call that chart RV Percentile vs VRP Scatter.\n\nThe Case of BTC\n\nHere's BTC's RV percentile vs VRP Scatter:\n\nLook closely at the different color dots and you can see the VRP normalized\nsignificantly over the course of the past month.\n\nThe question is...how?\n\nIf we hover over that yellow dot from a month age we can see the tooltip with\nthe data:\n\nOn March 24th, the VRP was 69% because IV was 73% and RV was about 37%*\n\n(*Brain damage that doesn't matter for you: we actually take log of the ratio\nbecause VRPs are closer to a lognormal distribution so better to compute\nstandard deviations on the log ratio)\n\nThe red dot is as of last night...IV is 68% and and realized vol is 67%\n\nSo what happened?\n\nThe IV did come in a small amount but the realized vol nearly doubled. The VRP\nis now negligibly small which is expected when realized volatility gets\ntowards the high end of its range...This is the mirror image of the fat VRPs\nwe see when realized volatility is low. At high levels of realized vols,\nvolatility risk premia gets flat or even sub-zero as the market doesn't expect\nsuch high realized volatility to persist.\n\nIf you hover over the dots in the \"comet\" you will see how VRP came in mostly\nbecause the denominator expanded.\n\nIV was pretty \"smart\"!\n\nA month ago, seeing the very fat VRP but with realized vol in the 55th\npercentile I would have said it looked like a sale because while it has room\nfor RV to expand you are getting a significant margin of safety.\n\nBut every opinion deserves its caveats. These are mine:\n\n  1. I'm not sure the extent to which the halving was anticipated to be a single day high-variance move like a stock's earnings or if the volatility was expected to be spread out. Understanding the context of the market is helpful. The math reasoning behind whether it's a one-day variance event or spread out comes from a simple observation: Variance is volatility squared so a single 15% move has a larger effect on an option's fair price than than say 3 days of 7% moves. .152 > 3 * .072\n\n  2. Percentiles are a sample not the full truth. We are always acting without full info so this is more of a blanket caveat.\n\n  3. Even though the VRP declined these are using constant maturity measures. Your p/l experience depends on the actual fixed strikes you traded. My gut reaction is that even though the VRP declined, the choppy path probably sucked for a short vol trader. If they dynamically hedged they likely sampled a higher realized than what we measured.\n\nCross-sectional Perspective\n\nHave another look at the REAL chart from March 24th. Look how cheap energy\nvols were?!\n\nThe market was giving you XLE and XOP IVs at levels cheaper than the 5th\npercentile of realized volatility! That doesn't set up often (this is the type\nof vol you buy with both hands).\n\nSo if you sold the \"upper right quadrant\" in names like BTC, hopefully you\nused our lens to buy \"the lower left quadrant\".\n\nWe are excited about the community we are building at moontower. We are\nworking on a large roadmap of analytics, adding more ETFs and then single\nnames. And critically, we are building the educational ladder to help users\nemploy these tools to make better choices regardless of their investment or\ntrading objectives whether it's hedging, speculating, or finding opportunities\nto sell risk premiums.\n\nThe lens of a vol trader tailored for your objectives. That's option analytics\nwith a point of view.\n\nWe have extended beta pricing until the end of May:\n\nhttps://app.moontower.ai/signup\n\nHappy Trading,\n\nKris and Emi\n\n", "frontpage": false}
