It\u2019s going to change in the coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, check this video.\n\n# Table of contentsPermalink\n\nThis article covers topics like: basic trig, epicycles, and Fourier series.\n\n  * The Circle\n  * The number \u03c0\n  * Radians\n  * The sine and the cosine\n  * The cos leads the sin\n  * The parity of cos and sin\n  * Complex Numbers and the Unit Circle\n  * Multiplying with i means a rotation with 2\u03c0\n  * Euler\u2019s identity\n  * Euler\u2019s formula, the connection between e, \u03c0 and i\n  * The sin and cos in their exponential form\n  * The sinusoid\n  * Sinusoids are flexible\n  * Sinusoids can be complex\n  * Sinusoids can nullify themselves\n  * Adding sinusoids leads to complexity\n  * Adding random sinusoids for fun\n  * Playing Sinusoidal tetris for fun\n  * A square wave and sinusoids\n  * Epicycles - First Encounter\n  * Epicycles - An intuitive understanding\n  * Epicycles - A flower\n  * Fourier Series\n  * Fourier Series in Exponential Form\n  * Example: The Fourier Series for the Box Function\n  * Example - The Fourier Series of the Triangle wave\n  * Example - The Fourier Series of a Sawtooth Function\n  * The Fourier Series Machinery\n\nto be continued\n\n# The CirclePermalink\n\nIt all starts with The Circle:\n\nThe Circle is a geometrical figure with a center P(a,b), and a radius r.\n\nIt has the following associated equation:\n\n(x\u2212a)2+(y\u2212b)2=r2\n\nIf a=0,b=0 and r=1, the circle becomes less generic, so we call it The Unit\nCircle:\n\nThe equation for The Unit Circle is:\n\nx2+y2=1\n\nOne could argue The Circle is the epitome of symmetry.\n\nPick one point, A, then its reflection on the other side, A\u2032, and start\nrotating:\n\nWhat happens on The Circle, stays on The Circle.\n\n# The number \u03c0Permalink\n\nWe rarely see angles expressed in degrees; usually, we represent them in\nrelation to the number PI \u03c0: \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, 4\u03c0, etc.;\n\n\u03c0 is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter. \u03c0 \u2248 3.14.\n\nIf r=1, the circle\u2019s perimeter is P=2\u03c0r, while the area is A=\u03c0r2. Both A and P\ndepend on \u03c0.\n\n\u03c0 is irrational and transcendental.\n\n# RadiansPermalink\n\nThe radian (or rad) is the actual unit we use to measure angles. An intimate\nrelationship exists between the radian and the number \u03c0.\n\nTo transform an angle measured in degrees (360\u00b0) to radians, the algorithm is\nsimple: we multiply the angle by \u03c0, then divide the result by 180.\n\n# The sine and the cosinePermalink\n\nWe can define sin and cos in relationship to The Unit Circle:\n\n  * \u03b8 is the angle formed by the radius, r and the x axis, at every given point.\n  * The sin function represents the y-coordinate of a point on the Unit Circle;\n  * The cos function is the x-coordinate of the same point on the Unit Circle.\n\nsin and cos are periodic functions with the period 2\u03c0.\n\nAt this point, it will be unfair for cos not to plot it on the same graph:\n\n# The cos leads the sinPermalink\n\nPutting cos and sin side by side, we observe that they are not that different:\n\nsin(x+2\u03c0)=cos(x)\n\nWe say that cos leads the sin with 2\u03c0:\n\n# The parity of cos and sinPermalink\n\nThe parity of mathematical functions generally refers to whether a function is\neven, odd, or neither.\n\nThe cosine is even, meaning cos(x)=cos(\u2212x):\n\nAnd the sine is odd, meaning sin(\u2212x)=\u2212sin(x), or sin(x)=\u2212sin(\u2212x):\n\n# Complex Numbers and the Unit CirclePermalink\n\nIn the Complex Plane, the points on the circle are defined by the following\nequation:\n\nz=cos(\u03b8)+i\u2217sin(\u03b8)\n\n# Multiplying with i means a rotation with 2\u03c0Permalink\n\nMultiplying a complex number with imaginary unit i is the equivalent of\nrotating the number counterclockwise with 2\u03c0 on an \u201cimaginary circle\u201d with the\nradius: r=\u2223a+b\u2217i\u2223=a2+b2\n\nFor example, if we take z1\u2208C and we multiply it three times with i we will\nhave it rotated into the all 4 quadrants of the circle:\n\n# Euler\u2019s identityPermalink\n\nThe natural exponential function, often denoted as f(x)=ex, is a particular\ncase of the exponential function where the base is e, also known as Euler\u2019s\nNumber (e\u22482.71828).\n\ne, just like \u03c0, irrational and transcendental.\n\nWe normally define e as:\n\ne=n=0\u2211\u221e(n!1)=0!1+1!1+2!1+... e=x\u2192\u221elim(1+x1)x e=x\u21920lim(x+1)x1\n\nEven if not obvious, there\u2019s a strong connection between e and the circle.\n\nThe natural exponentiation function is an eigenfunction for differentiation.\n\nAn eigenfunction in this context is a function that, when differentiated,\nyields a constant multiple of itself:\n\ndxdeax=a\u2217ex\n\nIf we substitute a\u2192e, by subsequently differentiating f(x)=eix, we obtain:\n\ndxdf(x)=dxd(eix)=i\u2217eix dx2d2f(x)=dx2d2(eix)=dxd(i\u2217eix)=\u2212eix\ndx3d3f(x)=dx3d3(eix)=dxd(\u2212eix)=\u2212i\u2217eix\ndx4d4f(x)=dx4d4(eix)=dxd(\u2212i\u2217eix)=eix=f(x)\n\nIn simple terms, after we differentiate f(x) four times\n(f\u2032(x),f\u2032\u2032(x),f\u2032\u2032\u2032(x),f\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032(x)), our function does a full circle.\n\nIt\u2019s the same pattern described in the previous section when we multiplied our\nz1 with i.\n\nSubsequently deriving eix is the equivalent of subsequently multiplying eix\nwith i. Multiplying a complex number with i means rotating that number in the\nComplex Plane with 2\u03c0.\n\nBut what is a derivative of a function at a certain point?\n\nIt\u2019s the rate of change of that function at that particular point. But we\u2019ve\njust said that the derivative of eix is equivalent to a rotation.\n\nSo, the rate of change is rotational.\n\nWe can intuitively feel that the function eix describes an actual circle.\n\nThere\u2019s no other possible solution. So we can boldly affirm that\neix=cos(x)+i\u2217sin(x) (which is the formula discovered by Euler).\n\nOf course, this is not a rigorous demonstration. One can prove Euler\u2019s\nidentity using Taylor Series.\n\n# Euler\u2019s formula, the connection between e, \u03c0 and iPermalink\n\nEuler\u2019s formula is a thing of marvel:\n\neix=cos(x)+i\u2217sin(x)\n\nOr, if we choose x=\u03c0:\n\nei\u03c0+1=0\n\n# The sin and cos in their exponential formPermalink\n\nBy substituting x\u2192\u2212x into Euler\u2019s identity we obtain:\n\ne\u2212ix=cos(x)\u2212i\u2217sin(x)\n\nIf we add/subtract the two equalities, we will obtain the definition of the\nsine and cosine functions in their exponential form:\n\ncos(x)=2eix+e\u2212ix sin(x)=2\u2217ieix\u2212e\u2212ix\n\nAll points of the circle are determined by a functon z(x), where:\n\nz(x)=eix=Re(x)cos(x)+Im(x)i\u2217sin(x)\n\nx represents the actual angle \u03b8\u2208R, so z(\u03b8)=ei\u03b8=cos(\u03b8)+i\u2217sin(\u03b8).\n\nYou\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve interchanged x with t and \u03b8 throughout the article.\nIt\u2019s confusing, but don\u2019t get confused. We are the ones to decide how to look\nat x, as an angle or as time.\n\n# The sinusoidPermalink\n\nA sinusoid, or a sine wave, is a smooth, repetitive curve defined by following\nfunction:\n\ny(t)=A\u2217sin(2\u03c0ft+\u03c6)=A\u2217sin(\u03c9t+\u03c6)\n\n  * A is called the amplitude, representing the maximum deviation of the function from zero.\n  * f is called ordinary frequency and denotes the number of oscillations (the radius moving inside the circle) occurring each second.\n  * \u03c9=2\u03c0f is called the angular frequency; it\u2019s the same thing as ordinary frequency, but we measure it secondradians;\n  * \u03c6 is called phase offset; it\u2019s measured in radians.\n\nIf we consider time to be the x-axis, and y(t) the y-axis, the sinusoid\nbecomes:\n\ny=f(x)=A\u2217sin(\u03c9x+\u03c6)\n\nThe sin and cos are just particular cases of sinusoids.\n\n# Sinusoids are flexiblePermalink\n\nThe following animation is interactive. You can choose the values of A= , \u03c9=\nand \u03c6= to plot the sinusoid (if you pick \u03c6=2\u03c0 a cosine is plotted):\n\n# Sinusoids can be complexPermalink\n\nStarting with the definition of a sinusoid:\n\ny(t)=A\u2217sin(2\u03c0ft+\u03c6)=A\u2217sin(\u03c9t+\u03c6)\n\nIf we multiply each side with A:\n\nA\u2217ei\u03b8=A\u2217(cos(\u03b8)+i\u2217sin(\u03b8))\n\nIf we substitute \u03b8 with \u03b8=\u03c9t+\u03c6 we obtain the complex sinusoid:\n\ns(t)=A\u2217ei(\u03c9t+\u03c6)=A\u2217cos(\u03b8\u03c9t+\u03c6)+i\u2217A\u2217sin(\u03b8\u03c9t+\u03c6)\n\nA complex sinusoid captures the behavior of two sinusoids (one cosine and one\nsine) on both its axes; on the real part, it behaves like a cosine, while on\nits imaginary part, it behaves like a sine.\n\nThe two are in sync as they both depend on the free variable \u03b8, expressed as\n\u03b8=\u03c9t+\u03c6.\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nTwo interesting observations:\n\n  * If we project the complex sinusoid on the plane determined by the Y-axis and Z-axis, we will plot a sine (the Imaginary part);\n  * If we project the complex sinusoid on the plane determined by the X-axis and Z-axis, we will plot a cosine (the Real part);\n\n# Sinusoids can nullify themselvesPermalink\n\nTwo sinusoids in phase and sharing the same amplitude but with opposite\nfrequencies nullify themselves.\n\n# Adding sinusoids leads to complexityPermalink\n\nLet\u2019s plot two arbitrary selected sinusoids y1(x) and y2(x), where:\n\n  * y1(x)=109\u2217sin(7x+2\u03c0), and\n  * y2(x)=1012\u2217sin(3x\u22122) .\n\nThe sum y(x)=y1(x)+y2(x) shows an interesting pattern\n\n# Adding random sinusoids for funPermalink\n\nAdding more sinusoids to an existing one (A=1, \u03c9=1, \u03c6=1) generate more complex\npatterns:\n\n# Playing Sinusoidal tetris for funPermalink\n\nNot so long ago, I\u2019ve re-imagined the game of Tetris.\n\nIt\u2019s now possible to play Tetris with Sinusoids:\n\n# A square wave and sinusoidsPermalink\n\nIf we carefully choose the sinusoids, we can create predictable patterns:\n\nLet\u2019s take, for example, use the following formula:\n\ny(x)=\u03c04k=1\u2211\u221e2k\u22121sin(2\u03c0(2k\u22121)fx)\n\nThrough expansion, the formula becomes:\n\ny(x)=y1(x)\u03c04sin(\u03c9x)+y2(x)3\u03c04sin(3\u03c9x)+...+yk(x)(2k\u22121)\u03c04sin((2k\u22121)\u03c9x)+...\n\ny1(x),y2(x),y3(x),...,yk(x),... are all the individual sinusoids.\n\nIf we perform the sum, we will create a square wave. The more sinusoids we\npick, the better the approximation.\n\nPlease choose how many sinusoids you want to use, and let\u2019s see how the\nfunctions look like for (and \u03c9=):\n\n# Epicycles - First EncounterPermalink\n\nOne sinusoid has a corresponding circle that spins. So, the above animation\ncan be re-imagined like this:\n\nPick and \u03c9= to plot the circles and the corresponding yk(x) functions:\n\n# Epicycles - An intuitive understandingPermalink\n\nThere\u2019s an intuitive proof to this: each epicycle corresponds to a specific\nsinusoid; when we talk about combining the sinusoids, we are talking about\nsumming their positions at each point in time, and eventually, this operation\nreduces to subsequent vector additions.\n\nLet\u2019s take a simple example by introducing three arbitrarily picked sinusoids\nand their associated point vectors (or position vectors):\n\n  * y1(x)=1.4sin(x+1), with the associated position vector u1;\n  * y2(x)=0.8sin(2\u2217x), with the associated position vector u2;\n  * y3(x)=0.5sin(3\u2217x), with the associated position vector u3.\n\nTheir sum is y(x)=y1(x)+y2(x)+y3(x)=1.4sin(x+1)+=0.8sin(2\u2217x)+0.5sin(3\u2217x).\n\nA position vector represents the displacement from the origin (0,0) to a\nspecific point in space. In our case, the vector (x,yk(x)) represents the\nposition or location of a point on the graph of the function(s) yk(x) at a\nparticular x value.\n\nIf we plot y(x) on the cartesian grid we obtain something like:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nAt each given point x, we can say for certain that u=u1+u2+u3.\n\n# Epicycles - A flowerPermalink\n\nIf we carefully pick the right sinusoids the moving circles can describe\n(approximate) any shape we want.\n\nHere is a flower for example:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nCan you guess the individual sinusoids working together to draw the flower?\n\nYou probably can\u2019t unless you apply methods from a branch of mathematics\ncalled Fourier Analysis.\n\n# Fourier SeriesPermalink\n\nFourier Series is the mathematical process through which we expand a periodic\nfunction of period P as a sum of trigonometric functions.\n\nDo you remember the Pink Floyd\u2019s album cover for the Dark Side of The Moon:\n\nImagine our function f(x) is the light itself, the prism is essentially\nFourier Mathematics, and the spectral colors emanating from the prism are the\nsinusoids.\n\nFollowing the analogy the formula looks like this:\n\nlight itselff(x)=the spectral componentsA0+n=1\u2211\u221e[Ancos(P2\u03c0nx)+Bnsin(P2\u03c0nx)]\n\nWhere An and Bn are called Fourier Coefficients are defined by the following\nintegrals:\n\nA0=P1\u222b\u22122P+2Pf(x)dx An=P2\u222b\u22122P+2Pf(x)\u2217cos(P2\u03c0nx)dx Bn=P2\u222b\u22122P+2Pf(x)\u2217sin(P2\u03c0nx)dx\n\n# Fourier Series in Exponential FormPermalink\n\nWith the help of Euler\u2019s Formula and by changing the sine and cosine functions\nin their exponential forms, we can also express the Fourier Series of a\nfunction as a sum of Complex Sinusoids:\n\nf(x)=n=\u2212N\u2211NCnei2\u03c0Pnx\n\nWhere:\n\nCn=\u23a9\u23a8\u23a7A021(An\u2212i\u2217Bn)21(An+i\u2217Bn)if n=0if n>0if n<0\n\nIf we do additional substitutions, the final form of Cn is:\n\nCn=P1\u222b\u22122P2Pe\u2212i2\u03c0Pnxf(x)dx\n\n# Example: The Fourier Series for the Box FunctionPermalink\n\nRemember the Square Wave we\u2019ve approximated with sinusoids in this section? At\nthat point, we used the following formula to express the Square as a sum of\nsinusoidal components:\n\ny(x)=\u03c04k=1\u2211\u221e2k\u22121sin(2\u03c0(2k\u22121)fx)\n\nOr, to keep things simpler, by substituting \u03c9=2\u03c0f (\u03c9 is the angular\nfrequency):\n\ny(x)=\u03c04k=1\u2211\u221e2k\u22121sin((2k\u22121)\u03c9x)\n\nIt\u2019s time to understand how we\u2019ve devised such an approximation.\n\nIn isolation, the Square Wave, f(x) looks like this:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nThroughout the interval [0, 2L], f(x) can be written as:\n\nf(x)=2[H(Lx)\u2212H(Lx\u22121)]\u22121\n\nWhere H(x) is called the Heavisde Step Function and has the following\ndefinition:\n\nH(x)={01if x<0if x\u22650\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s look at A0=2L1\u222b02Lf(x)dx. Notice how we\u2019ve changed the\ninterval from [\u22122P,2P] to [0,2L] to match our example. This will be reflected\nin the formulas.\n\nWell, this coefficient (A0) is a fancy way to express the average of f(x) over\nthe interval (in our case [0, 2L]). In the same time A0 is the area determined\nby f(x) over [0, 2L] then divided by 2L. But if you look at the plot again,\nyou will see that the net area is 0, because the green area (S1) nullifies the\nred area (S2), regardless of L.\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nSecondly, let\u2019s compute the An=L1\u222b02Lf(x)\u2217cos(L\u03c0nx)dx coefficients. An\nimportant observation is that f(n) is odd, and its average value on the\ninterval is 0; we can safely say all the coefficients An also vanish.\n\nVisually speaking, regardless of how you pick n or L, the net area determined\nby the An integral will always be zero. It\u2019s visually obvious if we plot An.\nFor example plotting A1, A2, A3, A4 looks like this:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nSimilar symmetrical patterns will emerge if you increase the n in An and plot\nthem.\n\nThirdly, we need to compute:\n\nBn=L1\u222b02Lf(x)\u2217sin(L\u03c0nx)dx\n\nIf we plot a B1, B2, B3 and, let\u2019s say, B4 we can intuitively feel what\u2019s\nhappening with Bn:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nIf you have a keen eye for geometrical representations, you will notice that\nevery even Bn is also 0. The red and green areas nullify, so the net area\ndescribed by the integral is 0. The odd terms will be 2\u2217something, so let\u2019s\ncalculate that something.\n\nWe will need to split the integral on two sub-intervals [0,L] and [L,2L]\n(there\u2019s a chasm at L), but given the fact f(x) and sin(x) are odd, Bn can we\nwritten as:\n\nBn=2\u2217[L1\u222b0Lf(x)\u2217sin(L\u03c0nx)dx]\n\nWe can now perform u-substition, so we can write:\n\nBn=L2\u222b0nL\u03c0n\u03c0sin(Lu)du\n\nAfter we take the constant out, we compute the integral, use the intervals,\nand take into consideration the periodicity of cosine:\n\nBn=n\u03c02(1\u2212(\u22121)n)\n\nAnd now we see it, Bn is exactly 0 if n is even, and Bn=2\u2217n\u03c02 is n is odd.\n\nPutting all back into the master formula of the Fourier Series:\n\nf(x)=0A0+n=1\u2211\u221e[0Ancos(L\u03c0nx)+Bnsin(L\u03c0nx)]\n\nThings become:\n\nf(x)=\u03c04n=1,3,5...\u2211+\u221e(n1\u2217sin(L\u03c0nx))\n\nIf we substitute n\u21922k\u22121 and consider, we obtain the initial formula:\n\nf(x)=\u03c04k=1\u2211+\u221e((2k\u22121)sin(L\u03c0(2k\u22121)x))\n\nTo obtain the initial formula, we substitute L\u21922f1, and 2\u03c0f\u2192\u03c9, basically we\ncreate an interdependence between L (half of the interval) and \u03c9, L=\u03c9\u03c0:\n\nf(x)=\u03c04k=1\u2211\u221e2k\u22121sin((2k\u22121)\u03c9x)\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no way we can go to +\u221e, so let\u2019s consider s(x) as an\napproximation of f(x) that depends on n.\n\ns(x)=\u03c04k=1\u2211n2k\u22121sin((2k\u22121)\u03c9x)\u2248f(x)\n\nIn the next animation, you will see that by increasing n, the accuracy of our\napproximation gets better and better, and the gaps are slowly closed:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nTo understand how adding more coefficients improves the approximation, let\u2019s\nlook back again at a few of our coefficients s1(x), s2(x), s3(x), s4(x) and\ns5(x) (we will pick \u03c9=2\u03c0, so that 2L=1):\n\ns1(x)=\u03c04sin(2\u03c0x) s2(x)=3\u03c04sin(23\u03c0x) s3(x)=5\u03c04sin(25\u03c0x) s4(x)=7\u03c04sin(27\u03c0x)\ns5(x)=9\u03c04sin(29\u03c0x)\n\nEach of the 5 terms is a sinusoid, with \u03c04, 3\u03c04, etc. amplitudes, and 2\u03c0, 23\u03c0,\netc. frequencies.\n\nSo, if we were to approximate a Square Wave with its fifth partial sum (the\nred dot), we would obtain something like this:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nNotice how obsessed the red dot is with the blue dot (the actual function) and\nhow closely it follows it.\n\nWe can always add more terms to the partial sum to help the red dot in its\nholy mission, improving the approximation until nobody cares anymore.\n\n# Example - The Fourier Series of the Triangle wavePermalink\n\nWithout dealing with all the associated math, the Fourier Series decomposition\nfor a triangle-wave is:\n\ns(x)=\u03c028k=1\u2211N(2k\u22121)2(\u22121)k\u22121\u2217sin((2k\u22121)x)\n\nPlotting the function s(x), we will see that things converge smoothly and\nfast. As soon as n approaches 6, we can already observe the triangle:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nLet\u2019s compute the first terms six terms of the \u2211, so that:\n\ns(x)\u2248s1(x)+s2(x)+s3(x)+s4(x)+s5(x)+s6(x)\n\nWhere:\n\n  * The first term is s1(x)=\u03c028\u2217sin(x), where A=\u03c028, \u03c9=1, \u03c6=0;\n  * The second term is s2(x)=\u221232\u03c028\u2217sin(3x), where A=\u221232\u03c028, \u03c9=3, \u03c6=0;\n  * The third term is s3(x)=52\u03c028\u2217sin(5x), where A=52\u03c028, \u03c9=5, \u03c6=0;\n  * The fourth term is s4(x)=\u221272\u03c028\u2217sin(7x), where A=\u221272\u03c028, \u03c9=7, \u03c6=0;\n  * The fifth term is s5(x)=92\u03c028\u2217sin(9x), where A=92\u03c028, \u03c9=9, \u03c6=0;\n  * The sixth term is s6(x)=\u2212112\u03c028\u2217sin(11x), where A=\u2212112\u03c028, \u03c9=11, \u03c6=0;\n\nA keen eye will see will observe the that s2(x), s4(x), s6(x) and all the even\nterms are negative.\n\nA negative amplitude doesn\u2019t make too much sense, at least not in a physical\nsense. What are we going to do with the minus sign?\n\nWe have two options:\n\n  1. Because sin(\u2212x)=\u2212sin(x), nobody stops us to make the frequency negative. For example, s2(x)=32\u03c028\u2217sin(\u22123x), so that the \u03c9=\u22123. But again, why would we want a negative frequency? This also doesn\u2019t make sense in a physical sense.\n  2. We can use \u2223A\u2223 and shift the signal with \u03c0, so that \u03c6=\u03c0.\n\nIn practice, we will go with 2. as it\u2019s more practical and gives us more\ncontrol, but the two options are equivalent so that we can write s2(x) in both\nways:\n\ns2(x)=\u221232\u03c028\u2217sin(3x) s2(x)=32\u03c028\u2217sin(3x+\u03c0)\n\nVisually speaking, the results will not be surprising if we plot sin(\u2212x) and\nsin(x+\u03c0) side by side; the two are equivalent:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\nIf we consider this, the even terms of s(x) will become:\n\n  * s2(x)=32\u03c028\u2217sin(3x+\u03c0) ;\n  * s4(x)=72\u03c028\u2217sin(7x+\u03c0) ;\n  * s6(x)=112\u03c028\u2217sin(11x+\u03c0) ;\n  * ...and so on\n\n# Example - The Fourier Series of a Sawtooth FunctionPermalink\n\nShamelessly skipping the math demonstration, a reverse-sawtooth function has\nthe following form:\n\ns(x)=\u03c02k=1\u2211N(\u22121)k\u2217ksin(kx)\n\nPlotting s(x), while increasing n, things look like this:\n\n^^(Source code)\n\n# The Fourier Series MachineryPermalink\n\nTo better visualize what\u2019s happening, let\u2019s look at a Fourier Series Machinery\nand how the circles move to create beautiful practical patterns.\n\nYou can pick the shape of the desired signal from here: and the sketch will\nchange accordingly.\n\n^^(Source code)\n\n...A bunch of spinning circles on a stick, where each circle corresponds to\nexactly one term of the series - this is the marvelous Fourier Series\nMachinery.\n\nIf we run our signal through the Fourier Series Machinery, we will obtain The\nAmplitude (A) and The Phase (\u03c6) for each Frequency (\u03c9) from 1 to N. Isn\u2019t it\namazing? And it all comes down to a bunch of spinning circles... on a stick.\n\nto be continued\n\nUpdated: April 24, 2024\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn\n\n#### Comments\n\n## You May Also Enjoy\n\n## My list of challenging software projects some programmers should try\n\nMarch 28, 2024 10 minute read\n\nUnsolicited advice\n\n## 10 algebra problems selected from the Romanian Olympiad (Part 2)\n\nMarch 25, 2024 8 minute read\n\nA selection of non-trivial algebra problems.\n\n## Friday Links, March 2024\n\nMarch 15, 2024 2 minute read\n\nA collection of interesting links I\u2019ve discovered in February and March 2024\n\n## A surprising matrix problem\n\nMarch 14, 2024 4 minute read\n\nA surprising math problem from the Spanish Math Olympiad of 1988\n\n  * Feed\n\n\u00a9 2024 andreinc.
