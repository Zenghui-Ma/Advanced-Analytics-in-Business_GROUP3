We\njust need a conditional zoning amendment to allow us to do one specific\nactivity on commercially zoned property,\u201d Barber said.\n\nThe company is currently working to complete eight orders of its hybrid truck,\nand wherever they end up they are planning to hire between 40 and 50\nemployees.\n\n\u201cYou just can't afford anything around here. It's all being bought up, like I\nsaid, by investors who are selling to other investors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe bought the land and a shop in Terrace, an actual shop, for less than a\nthird of the amount of buying just the bare land [in Merritt] and with nothing\non it. Like, it's not economically feasible for businesses.\u201d\n\n### Limited land in Merritt\n\nPending the rezoning amendment, Merritt Mayor Mike Goetz said the city would\nabsolutely like to see the company stay. He said the city has a limited amount\nof land and none that would suit what Edison is looking for.\n\n\u201cWe started working with them and some developers around the community,\ngetting them together to talk about possibly leasing, buying or working on\nsome sort of a project,\u201d Goetz said.\n\n\u201cAll of that falls through, then the city has some acreage that we are\ndeveloping right now that we would be putting in to lease it out to somebody.\nIt's about four acres and it's something that we could look at working with\nthem on a fair lease agreement.\u201d\n\nGoetz said much of the land in Merritt has been purchased by private industry\nand there isn\u2019t much the city can do to influence the sale of property.\n\n\u201cWe've begun densification because our borders are full as far as they can\ngo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt's private people that own these pieces of property and the city doesn't\nreally have a lot of pull on what they do when they go to sell it. So we would\nlike to see it developed but we kind of get stuck in that game.\u201d\n\nHe said while he hopes Edison will stay, ultimately they\u2019ll go with the\noptions that\u2019s best for their company.\n\nAccording to Barber, Edison has received invitations to set up in the U.S.,\nincluding in Arizona and Nevada. He said he wants to stay in B.C. to\ncontribute jobs and business to the economy.\n\n\u201cI don't think the answer to when we look at things and say, \u2018Hey, cost of\nliving is going up things are going worse,\u2019 is to just put our tail between\nour legs and run to the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we should stay and make Canada and make British Columbia a better\nplace to live, rather than just tucking and running down to the U.S. That's\nnot a solution.\u201d\n\n### \u2018Built by beer and mechanics\u2019\n\nBarber said Edison Motors began two and half years ago after spending several\nyears prior pitching around the idea with his co-founder and Edison CTO Eric\nLittle.\n\n\u201cThe first two years was just drinking beers and saying cool ideas, I'm not\ngonna lie,\u201d Barber said. \u201cAnd we just grabbed some mechanics and started\npulling wrenches.\u201d\n\n\"This truck was built by beer and mechanics,\" he joked.\n\nBarber said logging in B.C. would be one of the most practical uses for a\nhybrid diesel-electric truck.\n\n\"Up here you're logging, so you're going up the mountain empty, and you're\ncoming down hill loaded with logs, so you can recharge those batteries on your\nway down and then you go back up again empty,\" he said.\n\nThrough attention they received online by documenting their project, Barber\nsaid they were able to crowdfund enough to cover the $300,000 cost of the\nfirst model, as well as the $1.5-million cost to develop their second model.\n\nHe said the videos also attracted experts who would recommend parts or assist\nin the development of the vehicle. He said approximately 130 people\ncontributed to the first model.\n\n\u201cIt's really been a huge community thing where local mechanics, engineers,\nelectrical engineers, mechanical engineers, all kinds came together,\u201d Barber\nsaid.\n\nBarber said he reserved a Tesla semi-truck when it was first announced, but\nbecame annoyed after seeing no finished product after several years and\ndecided to withdraw his deposit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling it Edison because we're stealing Tesla's idea to build an\nelectric semi. Give me my money back, I'll start my own company,\" he said.\n\n\"And that was the fundamental thing. So that $25,000 that we got refunded from\nTesla actually went to build this truck.\"\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTyposNews TipsForums\n\n39 Shares\n\nMust-Read Stories\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\nMore Kamloops News\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\n  * Spring cleanup at tent cityKelowna - 1:32 pm\n\n  * Rotary food drive beginsSalmon Arm - 1:27 pm\n\n  * Devil is in the demographicsBusiness - 1:10 pm\n\n  * What was missing in budgetCanada - 1:08 pm\n\n  * Was GG's office politicized?Canada - 1:07 pm\n\nMore Top Stories >\n\nReal Estate\n\n31-6663 Highway 97 S 3 bedrooms 2 baths $250,000 more details\n\n## Kamloops SPCA Featured Pet\n\nFreddy Kamloops SPCA >\n\n## Queen Elizabeth 'loved' things going wrong\n\nShowbiz | April 17, 2024\n\n## We've got the bleat\n\nMust Watch | April 17, 2024\n\n## Easy stuffed crust pizza\n\nMust Watch | April 17, 2024\n\n## Mid-week memes- April 17, 2024\n\nGalleries | April 17, 2024\n\n## I\u2019m only just getting started, says Victoria Beckham\n\nShowbiz | April 17, 2024\n\nKamloops Quick Links City of Kamloops Kamloops Weather Tourism Kamloops\nKamloops Transit Airport Arrivals Airport Departures School District 73\nKamloops Classifieds Kamloops Discussion Forum Thompson-Nicola Regional\nDistrict Interior Health Thompson Rivers University Thompson Career College\nThompson-Nicola Regional Library Kamloops Real Estate\n\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net\n\n  * Make Castanet Your Homepage\n  * News Tips\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact Us\n\n## Welcome\n\n# This site asks for consent to use your data\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 63 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
