Venice authorities consider 2024 as being the experimental phase\nof the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to preserve the great historical centres of the world,\u201d\nBrugnaro told reporters in Rome. \u201cOver history, nobody has risked ever trying\nthis ... no politician would do what I am about to do. If it works, everyone\nwill say it\u2019s banal, and if it doesn\u2019t work, it will create criticism and a\nbad impression.\u201d\n\nHow I stuck my oar in \u2013 and saw a Venice I\u2019ve never seen before\n\nRead more\n\nBrugnaro, an entrepreneur, said that when he thought of brave, risk-taking\npeople, Polo, who set off from Venice in 1271 at the aged of 17 and spent more\nthan two decades travelling through Asia, sprang to mind. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know\nwhere he was going, there was no GPS ... and he arrived in China. Then he\nreturned to Venice with important know-how.\u201d\n\nDay-trippers will be provided with a QR code once they\u2019ve booked their ticket,\nwhich is required only for access to Venice\u2019s historic centre. Stewards will\ncarry out checks at various access points and visitors risk fines of up to\n\u20ac300 if they arrive without a code.\n\nResidents, commuters, students and children under the age of 14 are exempt, as\nare tourists who stay overnight.\n\nCritics have accused the measure of being \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and restrictive\non freedom of movement, while others have argued that it could deter visitors.\n\nVenice authorities have been under pressure to come up with ways to manage\ntourism in the fragile city while also addressing depopulation on Venice\u2019s\nmain island, which since the early 1950s has lost more than 120,000 residents.\nLast year, the number of beds available to tourists on the main island\nsurpassed the number of year-round residents \u2013 now fewer than 49,000 \u2013 for the\nfirst time.\n\nBrugnaro said he hoped the entrance fee scheme would develop into something\nthat other cities grappling with overtourism could replicate.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Venice\n  * Italy\n  * Europe\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Venice to limit tourist group size to 25 to protect historic city\n\n31 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Venice gondola capsizes after tourists refuse to sit down and stop taking selfies\n\n6 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Venice to trial \u20ac5 ticketing system for day visitors from 2024\n\n5 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### I took my mum to Venice \u2013 it was instantly special\n\n29 Jul 2023\n\n  * ### Seagulls force Venice\u2019s Marco Polo airport to close briefly\n\n13 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Venice awaits Unesco heritage ruling as beds for tourists outnumber residents for first time\n\n11 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Venice crash victims named as debate rages over Italy\u2019s roads\n\n5 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Unesco recommends putting Venice on heritage danger list\n\n31 Jul 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
