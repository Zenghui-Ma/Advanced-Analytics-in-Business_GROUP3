These animals\nlived in Europe and North America during the last glacial period, around\n21,000 years ago. A new study used updated climate maps from that period, when\natmospheric carbon dioxide was lower, to better predict future warming under\nrising CO2.Mauricio Anton\n\nAs carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere, the Earth will get hotter.\nBut exactly how much warming will result from a certain increase in CO2 is\nunder study. The relationship between CO2 and warming, known as climate\nsensitivity, determines what future we should expect as CO2 levels continue to\nclimb.\n\nNew research led by the University of Washington analyzes the most recent ice\nage, when a large swath of North America was covered in ice, to better\nunderstand the relationship between CO2 and global temperature. It finds that\nwhile most future warming estimates remain unchanged, the absolute worst-case\nscenario is unlikely.\n\nThe open-access study was published April 17 in Science Advances.\n\n\u201cThe main contribution from our study is narrowing the estimate of climate\nsensitivity, improving our ability to make future warming projections,\u201d said\nlead author Vince Cooper, a UW doctoral student in atmospheric sciences. \u201cBy\nlooking at how much colder Earth was in the ancient past with lower levels of\ngreenhouse gases, we can estimate how much warmer the current climate will get\nwith higher levels of greenhouse gases.\u201d\n\nThe new paper doesn\u2019t change the best-case warming scenario from doubling CO2\n\u2014 about 2 degrees Celsius average temperature increase worldwide \u2014 or the most\nlikely estimate, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. But it reduces the worst-\ncase scenario for doubling of CO2 by a full degree, from 5 degrees Celsius to\n4 degrees Celsius. (For reference, CO2 is currently at 425 ppm, or about 1.5\ntimes preindustrial levels, and unless emissions drop is headed toward double\npreindustrial levels before the end of this century.)\n\nAs our planet heads toward a doubling of CO2, the authors caution that the\nrecent decades are not a good predictor of the future under global warming.\nShorter-term climate cycles and atmospheric pollution\u2019s effects are just some\nreasons that recent trends can\u2019t reliably predict the rest of this century.\n\n\u201cThe spatial pattern of global warming in the most recent 40 years doesn\u2019t\nlook like the long-term pattern we expect in the future \u2014 the recent past is a\nbad analog for future global warming,\u201d said senior author Kyle Armour, a UW\nassociate professor of atmospheric sciences and of oceanography.\n\nInstead, the new study focused on a period 21,000 years ago, known as the Last\nGlacial Maximum, when Earth was on average 6 degrees Celsius cooler than\ntoday. Ice core records show that atmospheric CO2 then was less than half of\ntoday\u2019s levels, at about 190 parts per million.\n\n\u201cThe paleoclimate record includes long periods that were on average much\nwarmer or colder than the current climate, and we know that there were big\nclimate forcings from ice sheets and greenhouse gases during those periods,\u201d\nCooper said. \u201cIf we know roughly what the past temperature changes were and\nwhat caused them, then we know what to expect in the future.\u201d\n\nResearchers including co-author Gregory Hakim, a UW professor of atmospheric\nsciences, have created new statistical modeling techniques that allow\npaleoclimate records to be assimilated into computer models of Earth\u2019s\nclimate, similar to today\u2019s weather forecasting models. The result is more\nrealistic temperature maps from previous millennia.\n\nFor the new study the authors combined prehistoric climate records \u2014 including\nocean sediments, ice cores, and preserved pollen \u2014 with computer models of\nEarth\u2019s climate to simulate the weather of the Last Glacial Maximum. When much\nof North America was covered with ice, the ice sheet didn\u2019t just cool the\nplanet by reflecting summer sunlight off the continents, as previous studies\nhad considered.\n\nThe left panel shows the sea surface temperature map during the most recent\nice age, 21,000 years ago, compared to modern preindustrial temperatures. This\nnew, more detailed analysis shows that the strong cooling over the northern\noceans, caused by the North American ice sheet, contributed substantially to\ntotal global cooling. The right panel shows that the warming of the ocean\u2019s\nsurface expected under future doubling of atmospheric CO2 displays a different\npattern of temperature change, with a lower expectation for globally averaged\nwarming than previous worst-case estimates.Cooper et al./Science Advances\n\nBy altering wind patterns and ocean currents, the ice sheet also caused the\nnorthern Pacific and Atlantic oceans to become especially cold and cloudy.\nAnalysis in the new study shows that these cloud changes over the oceans\ncompounded the glacier\u2019s global cooling effects by reflecting even more\nsunlight.\n\nIn short, the study shows that CO2 played a smaller role in setting ice age\ntemperatures than previously estimated. The flipside is that the most dire\npredictions for warming from rising CO2 are less likely over coming decades.\n\n\u201cThis paper allows us to produce more confident predictions because it really\nbrings down the upper end of future warming, and says that the most extreme\nscenario is less likely,\u201d Armour said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really change the lower\nend, or the average estimate, which remain consistent with all the other lines\nof evidence.\u201d\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the Department of\nDefense\u2019s National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship, the\nAlfred P.
