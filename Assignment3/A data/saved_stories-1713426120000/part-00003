The link leads to Newsweek\u2019s editorial standards\npage, where several paragraphs now outline how generative AI tools are being\nfolded into the publication\u2019s editorial process.\n\nThe disclosure is just one signal of a larger experiment with AI-assisted\neditorial work happening right now at the 90-year-old brand.\n\nNewsweek first announced changes to its AI policy in September 2023, just as\nheated debates over early AI adoption in journalism began to boil over. Sports\nIllustrated and Gizmodo were among several publications criticized late last\nyear for their shoddy use of generative AI tools to write articles.\nPublications, like Wired, responded by largely denouncing tools like ChatGPT\nin editorial work, promising to never publish text written or edited by AI.\n\nNewsweek, meanwhile, has joined competitors like Business Insider in taking a\nrelatively bullish view on the technology. \u201cNewsweek believes that AI tools\ncan help journalists work faster, smarter and more creatively,\u201d reads the\nupdated standards page. \u201cWe firmly believe that soon all journalists will be\nworking with AI in some form and we want our newsroom to embrace these\ntechnologies as quickly as is possible in an ethical way.\u201d\n\nSix months into this new policy, staff writers and editors have not been\nrequired to use AI, but they are being encouraged to experiment with it to\nboost speed and efficiency. Newsweek has also rolled out a custom-built AI\nvideo production tool and is currently on a hiring spree for a new AI-focused\nLive News desk to cover breaking stories.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nThe Intercept charts a new legal strategy for digital publishers suing OpenAI\n\nAndrew Deck\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\n\u201cI think that the difference between newsrooms that embrace AI and newsrooms\nthat shun AI is really going to prove itself over the next several months and\nyears,\u201d Jennifer H. Cunningham, the new executive editor of Newsweek, told me.\nCunningham joined the publication in March, following her run as editor-in-\nchief of Insider\u2019s news division. \u201cWe have really embraced AI as an\nopportunity, and not some sort of bogeyman that\u2019s lurking in the newsroom.\u201d\n\nNewsweek has been working to rebuild its editorial credibility following a\nstring of legal issues and allegations of unethical journalism in recent\nyears. In early 2018, Newsweek\u2019s offices were raided by the Manhattan district\nattorney as part of an investigation into its former owner, Etienne Uzac.\n(Uzac later pled guilty on fraud and money-laundering charges involving\nNewsweek\u2019s parent company at the time, IBT Media, and at the end of 2018,\nNewsweek broke off from IBT Media to form an independent company.) More\nrecently, Newsweek has been criticized for platforming far-right figures on\nits opinion vertical and podcasts.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Newsweek\u2019s CEO Dev Pragad has continued to grow the\npublication\u2019s digital presence and shift its revenue streams away from its\nmarquee print magazine. So far in 2024, Newsweek.com has seen more than 130\nmillion total sessions every month and over 50 million monthly unique\nvisitors, according to the publication\u2019s advertiser disclosure figures and\nmedia kit. The site has a clear focus on quick-turnaround news, aggregation,\nand op-eds. In one 2019 editorial staff email, editor-in-chief Nancy Cooper\nsummarized the current Newsweek story strategy succinctly: \u201cWe don\u2019t want\nfewer stories or slower stories, just to make every story we do better.\u201d\n\nIn service of more stories, and faster stories, Newsweek\u2019s AI policy addendum\ngives staffers the greenlight to use generative AI in \u201cwriting, research,\nediting, and other core journalism functions,\u201d as long as journalists are\ninvolved in each step of the process. The original version of Newsweek\u2019s\npolicy stated that using AI for \u201ccore journalism functions\u201d required touch\npoints with \u201cthree or more journalists\u201d during production. A review of the\npage on the Wayback Machine shows that line was removed sometime after March\n2.\n\nThere are fewer restrictions on reporters who use AI for other tasks,\naccording to the standards page, including \u201cnote taking, transcription, video\nscript writing, writing social copy, A/B testing headlines, adding metadata or\nselecting images.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would really like reporters to be able to devote their workday to\njournalistic output and not the parts of journalism that are a little bit more\nprocess-oriented, kind of ticking the boxes, if you will,\u201d said Cunningham.\n\nNewsweek provided one example of a story published under this new AI policy.\nThe short news piece by Taiwan-based staff writer Aadil Brar details Sri\nLanka\u2019s decision to ban a Chinese research vessel from docking in its port,\nand was researched with the help of ChatGPT Plus. Cunningham also pointed to\nlegal reporting as a specific beat primed for generative AI support at\nNewsweek. She said she\u2019d encourage a reporter to use a tool like ChatGPT to\nsummarize \u201cverbose or complex or lengthy court decisions\u201d to help turn out\nnews coverage.\n\nDespite \u201cwriting\u201d being among the approved use cases, Cunningham claimed in\nour interview that no published Newsweek stories have been written with AI\ntools. On a follow-up call, Newsweek spokesperson Ben Billingsley clarified\nthat text generators have been used as an assistive tool to draft stories in\nsome cases. Billingsley said 5% of the stories on Newsweek.com use AI tools\nfor drafting, and that the most accepted use case internally is for staffers\n\u201cwho speak English as a second language.\u201d\n\nAlongside standard professional subscriptions to the chatbots Microsoft\nCopilot and ChatGPT, and the image generator Dall-E, Newsweek is also building\nproprietary AI tools in-house, according to Newsweek\u2019s new chief product\nofficer Bharat Krish.\n\nKrish \u2014 who previously served as chief technology officer at Time and co-\nfounded the facial recognition startup Refine AI \u2014 said there is currently no\npermanent AI product strategy at Newsweek. Instead, he describes the approach\nas a set of experiments.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect help from the disruptors\u201d: The FT\u2019s chief executive on AI,\n\u201cloyalist\u201d readers, and its U.S. expansion\n\nSarah Scire\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n\u201cIf I tell you something that\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, a week later, that\ntechnology could have evolved,\u201d Krish said. \u201cIt\u2019s moving so fast. We\u2019re trying\nto keep up with it.\u201d\n\nOne of those experiments is already live. Over the last several months,\nNewsweek\u2019s engineering team launched a custom tool that produces short-form\nvideo summaries of existing news articles. The internal tool first creates a\nvideo script summarizing the news story, then finds and pulls relevant stock\nimages and video clips, stitching them together into one cohesive video. Krish\nsays the proprietary technology was built using a combination of open-source\ntools and GPT-4 Turbo, the professional-tier large multimodal model released\nby OpenAI in December 2023.\n\nAlthough much of the process is automated, the tool still requires a human\nvideo editor to review the transcript, manually select additional images, and\ntweak the final edit.\n\nThe clips, often about 30 to 90 seconds long, are featured at the top of many\nnews stories on the site. As an example, a Newsweek spokesperson shared the\nvideo from this recent story on April 9, which summarizes the findings of a\nresearch study on globalization out of the University of Chicago. The summary\ntext is overlaid onto stock videos of crowds from different parts of the\nworld.\n\nKrish describes the tool as a way to get further mileage with stories,\nrepackaging reporting that already exists on the site. \u201cWe have a small\nmultimedia team. They cannot handle the volume of requests from all this\ncontent that needs video, and so this tool helps augment,\u201d he said.\n\n### Building an AI-powered breaking news desk\n\nNewsweek\u2019s jobs board currently includes a host of open positions across\neditorial, audience, and sales. Some job listings are for reporters and\neditors who will be mandated to integrate AI into their workflow as part of a\nnew Live News desk that prioritizes speed and efficiency.\n\n\u201cThis team will leverage the opportunities presented by advancements in\nartificial intelligence and other tools to produce journalism to a high\nstandard,\u201d a job description for Reporter (Live News) reads.\n\nReporters on the new Live News team will be responsible for \u201cproducing\nmultiple stories a day across several beats and topics\u201d \u2014 which may include\nU.S. politics, crime, celebrities, reality TV, and international current\naffairs \u2014 using AI tools, according to the listing. In an interview,\nCunningham emphasized that AI adoption on the Live News team, whether for\nresearch or editing, will be in service of \u201cquick turn types of reporting.\u201d\n\nJob postings for Live News writers and editors are based in Newsweek\u2019s New\nYork and London offices and make explicit that a \u201cworking knowledge\u201d of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and image generators are among the criteria for hiring.\nAlongside more run-of-the-mill editorial and management responsibilities, the\nlead editor for the Live News desk is also expected to \u201chave a comprehensive\nunderstanding of media law.\u201d\n\nIn any workplace, a wave of AI adoption often goes hand-in-hand with anxieties\nabout job displacement. Cunningham claimed, however, that existing Newsweek\nroles will not be affected by these AI initiatives.\n\n\u201cListen, I totally understand and commiserate with reporters, possibly feeling\nanxious, especially because of the headwinds generally \u2014 that have nothing to\ndo with AI \u2014 that have impacted newsrooms around the country. In the last six\nmonths, a lot of shops have closed, there have been layoffs,\u201d she said.\nCunningham noted that unlike many news publications, Newsweek is expanding.\n\u201cAt a time when many other news entities are shuttering, or are freezing\nhiring \u2014 we\u2019re hiring.\u201d\n\n### When AI tools go wrong\n\nThe Live News editor, in addition to staying up-to-date on media law, will be\nexpected to ensure all stories published from the desk are \u201caccurate and\nfair.\u201d It\u2019s not a straightforward task. Many AI chatbots and text generators \u2014\nincluding ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google\u2019s Gemini \u2014 have been widely\ncriticized for factual inaccuracies.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nWriting guidelines for the role of AI in your newsroom? Here are some, er,\nguidelines for that\n\nHannes Cools\n\nJuly 11, 2023\n\nCunningham says the solution to these shortcomings is transparency. \u201cWe want\nto make sure that the reader that we\u2019re serving is very clear about the use of\nthis technology in the content he or she is viewing or reading. It\u2019s really\nimportant. I think also ethically, it\u2019s important,\u201d she said.\n\nThat said, readers likely won\u2019t be able to discern whether an error in a\nNewsweek story originated from a chatbot, or other AI tool. Currently,\nNewsweek only plans to include the general disclaimer of its AI editorial\npolicies on article pages. The publication is not marking whether individual\nstories were produced with assistive AI tools or disclosing in corrections\nwhether an AI tool contributed to the error.\n\nNewsweek\u2019s corrections page lists every story on the website that required an\namended factual error or other significant update. All corrections are\norganized by month. In September, when Newsweek first changed its generative\nAI policy, the number of corrections across the site totaled 21. Every month\nsince then, the number of total corrections increased by a handful. In March,\nfor example, Newsweek issued 54 corrections across its site. Under the current\npolicy, it\u2019s not possible for readers to know whether AI tools contributed to\nany of the errors in these stories.\n\nWhen asked how Newsweek has handled corrections due to AI-assisted stories,\nCunningham maintained there have been no errors introduced into a published\nNewsweek story by generative AI tools.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to be transparent, and take accountability for any errors\nthat occur, whether they\u2019re human error or AI error, but fortunately, that\nhasn\u2019t been something that we\u2019ve had to deal with yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI think\nit\u2019s clear to the reader that we\u2019re utilizing AI and that we\u2019re being open and\nhonest about our use of AI.\u201d\n\nFor now, Newsweek is describing its AI strategy as flexible. \u201cWe\u2019re in the\ninfancy of this,\u201d said Krish, who shared that his engineering teams are\nworking towards releasing other AI-backed editorial projects. \u201cWhere the\nfuture goes, we don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re at least building up the skill set in-\nhouse.\u201d\n\nAndrew Deck is a generative AI staff writer at Nieman Lab.
