Passed by the House of Representatives last week, a provision\ncontained in the bill\u2014known as the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America\nAct (RISAA)\u2014threatens to significantly expand the scope of the spy program,\nhelping the government to compel the assistance of whole new categories of\nbusinesses.\n\nLegal experts argue the provision could enable the government to conscript\nvirtually anyone with access to facilities or equipment housing communications\ndata, forcing \u201cdelivery personnel, cleaning contractors, and utilities\nproviders,\u201d among others, to assist US spies in acquiring access to Americans\u2019\nemails, phone calls, and text messages\u2014so long as one side of the\ncommunication is foreign.\n\nA global tech trade association, the Information Technology Industry Council\n(ITI), is now urging Congress to avoid passing RISAA due to a particular\nprovision \u201cdramatically expanding the scope of entities and individuals\ncovered\u201d by the program, known as Section 702. Changes to the 702 program\nincluded in the House bill, ITI says, would only serve to send customers in\nthe US and abroad fleeing to foreign competitors, convincing many that\ntechnology in the US is far too exposed to government surveillance.\n\nThe group\u2019s membership includes several major equipment manufacturers, such as\nEricsson, Nokia, and Broadcom, as well as large cloud storage providers like\nGoogle, Microsoft, IBM, and Salesforce. \u201cITI\u2019s position is that the provision\nshould be removed,\u201d the group\u2019s communications director, Janae Washington,\ntells WIRED. \u201cOur positions are based on member consensus.\u201d\n\nThe individual ITI member companies WIRED contacted for their comment on the\nlegislation did not immediately respond or declined to comment.\n\nThe provision under fire stems from a ruling handed down by the US\ngovernment\u2019s secret surveillance court\u2014the FISA court\u2014that oversees the 702\nprogram. The program is designed to target the communications of foreigners,\nincluding calls and emails to and from US citizens. To this aim, the federal\nstatute specifies that the government may compel the assistance of businesses\nthat fall into the category of what it calls \u201celectronic communications\nservice providers,\u201d or ECSPs.\n\nCompanies like Google and AT&T have typically fallen into this category as\ndirect providers of the services being wiretapped; however, the US government\nhas also moved in recent years to interpret the term more broadly as part of\nan effort to expand the roster of entities whose assistance it\u2019s allowed to\ncompel.\n\nThe FISA court, in a decision backed by its own review body, pushed back\nagainst the expanded definition, telling the government that what constitutes\nan ECSP remains \u201copen to reconsideration by the branches of government whose\ncompetence and constitutional authority extend to statutory revision.\u201d\n\nMore concisely: The court reminded the government that only Congress has the\npower to rewrite the law.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nThe US Intelligence Community (IC) thus began a campaign to ensure that this\nyear\u2019s legislation reauthorizing the 702 program redefines \u201cECSP\u201d to address\nwhat it calls a \u201ccollection gap resulting from recent court opinions.\u201d\n\nInternal emails obtained by WIRED show that members of the House Intelligence\nCommittee served as intermediaries for the IC in its campaign to convince\nCongress to support the provision. An email circulated to House members in\nFebruary by Michael Calcagni, the intel committee\u2019s deputy staff director, for\ninstance, informed lawmakers that the \u201ccollection gap\u201d was both \u201cserious and\ndangerous\u201d and that \u201ccontrary to unsubstantiated assertions, it would not\nauthorize or enable the Government to conduct surveillance of any American who\nconnects to public WiFi at a Starbucks or McDonalds.\u201d\n\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading FISA experts, Marc Zwillinger, a private attorney\nwho has twice appeared before the FISA Court of Review, began raising the\nalarm in December over the provision, pointing to text that would allow the\ngovernment to compel the assistance of \u201cany service provider\u201d with access to\n\u201cequipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store\u201d communications,\nso long as one of the recipients is a foreigner reasonably believed to be\noverseas.\n\nWhile rejecting Zwillinger\u2019s analysis publicly, House intel members\nnevertheless attempted to quietly \u201cnarrow\u201d the provision to clamp down on any\ncriticism, excluding a handful of business types such as senior centers,\nhotels, and coffee shops. In a follow-up last week, Zwillinger and other\nattorneys who\u2019ve made rare appearances before the FISA court characterized the\nintel committee\u2019s improvements as \u201cmarginal,\u201d saying the need for the\nexclusions only served to demonstrate the government is overreaching.\n\nThe provision, Zwillinger says, continues to ensnare owners and operators of\nfacilities housing equipment used to store and carry data, \u201csuch as data\ncenters and buildings owned by commercial landlords, who merely have access to\ncommunications equipment in their physical space.\u201d The text could be\ninterpreted to extend to \u201cdelivery personnel, cleaning contractors, and\nutility providers.\u201d And while the new provision excludes businesses like\ncoffee shops, those businesses typically rely on cloud computer services whose\nequipment remains subject to the 702 program\u2019s expanded scope.\n\n\u201cAlthough the effects of this provision may be unintentional, its impacts\nwould be very real,\u201d ITI\u2019s senior vice president of policy, John Miller, says.\n\u201cThe language in the provision vastly expands the US government\u2019s warrantless\nsurveillance capabilities, damaging the competitiveness of US technology\ncompanies large and small, and arguably imperiling the continued global free\nflow of data between the US and its allies.\u201d\n\nShould it become apparent to the world that America\u2019s top IT companies\u2014data\ncenters, cloud providers, and security services alike\u2014have been turned into a\nwatering hole for the US Intelligence Community, many customers will \u201clikely\nlook to foreign competitors,\u201d Miller says, companies whose technologies are\nviewed as less exposed to clandestine government requests.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
