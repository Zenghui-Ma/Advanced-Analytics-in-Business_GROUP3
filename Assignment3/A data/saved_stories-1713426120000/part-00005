Adding\n> DP to a basic FLA system currently requires either adding excessive noise to\n> each device's updates, or assuming an honest service provider that correctly\n> implements the mechanism and only uses the privatized outputs. Secure\n> multiparty computation (SMPC) -based oblivious aggregations can limit the\n> service provider's access to individual user updates and improve DP\n> tradeoffs, but the tradeoffs are still suboptimal, and they suffer from\n> scalability challenges and susceptibility to Sybil attacks. This paper\n> introduces a novel system architecture that leverages trusted execution\n> environments (TEEs) and open-sourcing to both ensure confidentiality of\n> server-side computations and provide externally verifiable privacy\n> properties, bolstering the robustness and trustworthiness of private\n> federated computations.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.10764 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.10764v1 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.10764arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Hubert Eichner [view email] [v1] Tue, 16 Apr 2024 17:47:27 UTC (561 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Confidential Federated Computations, by Hubert\nEichner and 13 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
