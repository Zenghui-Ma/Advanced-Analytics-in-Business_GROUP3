He replied to these compliments in a speech, and,\ngracefully claiming the privileges of a literary society, entered at some\nlength into an Apology for Old Age, and, aiding himself by notes in his hand,\nmade a sort of running commentary on Cicero\u2019s chapter \u201cDe Senectute.\u201d The\ncharacter of the speaker, the transparent good faith of his praise and blame,\nand the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of his eager preference of Cicero\u2019s opinions to King David\u2019s,\ngave unusual interest to the College festival. It was a discourse full of\ndignity, honoring him who spoke and those who heard.\n\nThe speech led me to look over at home \u2014 an easy task \u2014 Cicero\u2019s famous essay,\ncharming by its uniform rhetorical merit; heroic with Stoical precepts; with a\nRoman eye to the claims of the State; happiest, perhaps, in his praise of life\non the farm; and rising, at the conclusion, to a lofty strain. But he does not\nexhaust the subject; rather invites the attempt to add traits to the picture\nfrom our broader modern life.\n\nCicero makes no reference to the illusions which cling to the element of time,\nand in which Nature delights. Wellington, in speaking of military men, said, \u2014\n\u201cWhat masks are these uniforms to hide cowards! When our journal is published,\nmany statues must come down.\u201d I have often detected the like deception in the\ncloth shoe, wadded pelisse, wig and spectacles, and padded chair of Age.\nNature lends herself to these illusions, and adds dim sight, deafness, cracked\nvoice, snowy hair, short memory, and sleep. These also are masks, and all is\nnot Age that wears them. Whilst we yet call ourselves young, and all our mates\nare yet youths and boyish, one good fellow in the set prematurely sports a\ngray or a bald head, which does not impose on us who know how innocent of\nsanctity or of Platonism he is, but does not less deceive his juniors and the\npublic, who presently distinguish him with a most amusing respect: and this\nlets us into the secret, that the venerable forms that so awed our childhood\nwere just such impostors. Nature is full of freaks, and now puts an old head\non young shoulders, and then a young heart beating under fourscore winters.\n\nFor if the essence of age is not present, these signs, whether of Art or\nNature, are counterfeit and ridiculous: and the essence of age is intellect.\nWherever that appears, we call it old. If we look into the eyes of the\nyoungest person, we sometimes discover that here is one who knows already what\nyou would go about with much pains to teach him; there is that in him which is\nthe ancestor of all around him: which fact the Indian Vedas express, when they\nsay, \u201cHe that can discriminate is the father of his father.\u201d And in our old\nBritish legends of Arthur and the Round-Table, his friend and counsellor,\nMerlin the Wise, is a babe found exposed in a basket by the river-side, and,\nthough an infant of only a few days, he speaks to those who discover him,\ntells his name and history, and presently foretells the fate of the by-\nstanders. Wherever there is power, there is age. Don\u2019t be deceived by dimples\nand curls. I tell you that babe is a thousand years old.\n\nTime is, indeed, the theatre and seat of illusion. Nothing is so ductile and\nelastic. The mind stretches an hour to a century, and dwarfs an age to an\nhour. Saadi found in a mosque at Damascus an old Persian of a hundred and\nfifty years who was dying, and was saying to himself, \u201cI said, coming into the\nworld by birth, \u2018I will enjoy myself for a few moments.\u2019 Alas! at the\nvariegated table of life I partook of a few mouthfuls, and the Fates said,\n\u2018Enough!\u2019\u201d That which does not decay is so central and controlling in us,\nthat, as long as one is alone by himself, he is not sensible of the inroads of\ntime, which always begin at the surface-edges. If, on a winter day, you should\nstand within a bell-glass, the face and color of the afternoon clouds would\nnot indicate whether it were June or January; and if we did not find the\nreflection of ourselves in the eyes of the young people, we could not know\nthat the century-clock had struck seventy instead of twenty. How many men\nhabitually believe that each chance passenger with whom they converse is of\ntheir own age, and presently find it was his father, and not his brother, whom\nthey knew!\n\nBut, not to press too hard on these deceits and illusions of Nature, which are\ninseparable from our condition, and looking at age under an aspect more\nconformed to the common sense, if the question be the felicity of age, I fear\nthe first popular judgments will be unfavorable. From the point of sensuous\nexperience, seen from the streets and markets and the haunts of pleasure and\ngain, the estimate of age is low, melancholy, and skeptical. Frankly face the\nfacts, and see the result. Tobacco, coffee, alcohol, hashish, prussic acid,\nstrychnine, are weak dilutions: the surest poison is time. This cup, which\nNature puts to our lips, has a wonderful virtue, surpassing that of any other\ndraught. It opens the senses, adds power, fills us with exalted dreams, which\nwe call hope, love, ambition, science: especially, it creates a craving for\nlarger draughts of itself. But they who take the larger draughts are drunk\nwith it, lose their stature, strength, beauty, and senses, and end in folly\nand delirium. We postpone our literary work until we have more ripeness and\nskill to write, and we one day discover that our literary talent was a\nyouthful effervescence which we have now lost. We had a judge in Massachusetts\nwho at sixty proposed to resign, alleging that he perceived a certain decay in\nhis faculties: he was dissuaded by his friends, on account of the public\nconvenience at that time. At seventy it was hinted to him that it was time to\nretire; but he now replied, that he thought his judgment as robust, and all\nhis faculties as good as ever they were. But besides the self-deception, the\nstrong and hasty laborers of the street do not work well with the chronic\nvaletudinarian. Youth is everywhere in place. Age, like woman, requires fit\nsurroundings. Age is comely in coaches, in churches, in chairs of state and\nceremony, in council-chambers, in courts of justice, and historical societies.\nAge is becoming in the country. But in the rush and uproar of Broadway, if you\nlook into the faces of the passengers, there is dejection or indignation in\nthe seniors, a certain concealed sense of injury, and the lip made up with a\nheroic determination not to mind it. Few envy the consideration enjoyed by the\noldest inhabitant. We do not count a man\u2019s years, until he has nothing else to\ncount. The vast inconvenience of animal immortality was told in the fable of\nTithonus. In short, the creed of the street is, Old Age is not disgraceful,\nbut immensely disadvantageous. Life is well enough, but we shall all be glad\nto get out of it, and they will all be glad to have us.\n\nThis is odious on the face of it. Universal convictions are not to be shaken\nby the whimseys of overfed butchers and firemen, or by the sentimental fears\nof girls who would keep the infantile bloom on their cheeks. We know the value\nof experience. Life and art are cumulative; and he who has accomplished\nsomething in any department alone deserves to be heard on that subject. A man\nof great employments and excellent performance used to assure me that he did\nnot think a man worth anything until he was sixty; although this smacks a\nlittle of the resolution of a certain \u201cYoung Men's Republican Club,\u201d that all\nmen should be held eligible who were under seventy. But in all governments,\nthe councils of power were held by the old; and patricians or patres, senate\nor senes, seigneurs or seniors, gerousia, the senate of Sparta, the presbytery\nof the Church, and the like, all signify simply old men.\n\nThis cynical lampoon is refuted by the universal prayer for long life, which\nis the verdict of Nature, and justified by all history. We have, it is true,\nexamples of an accelerated pace, by which young men achieved grand works; as\nin the Macedonian Alexander, in Raffaelle, Shakspeare, Pascal, Burns, and\nByron; but these are rare exceptions. Nature, in the main, vindicates her law.\nSkill to do comes of doing; knowledge comes by eyes always open, and working\nhands; and there is no knowledge that is not power. And if the life be true\nand noble, we have quite another sort of seniors than the frowzy, timorous,\npeevish dotards who are falsely old, \u2014 namely, the men who fear no city, but\nby whom cities stand; who appearing in any street, the people empty their\nhouses to gaze at and obey them: as at \u201cMy Cid, with the fleecy heard,\u201d in\nToledo; or Bruce, as Barbour reports him; as blind old Dandolo, elected Doge\nat eighty-four years, storming Constantinople at ninety-four, and after the\nrevolt again victorious, and elected at the age of ninety-six to the throne of\nthe Eastern Empire, which he declined, and died Doge at ninety-seven. We still\nfeel the force of Socrates, \u201cwhom well-advised the oracle pronounced wisest of\nmen\u201d; of Archimedes, holding Syracuse against the Romans by his wit, and\nhimself better than all their nation; of Michel Angelo, wearing the four\ncrowns of architecture, sculpture, painting, and poetry; of Galileo, of whose\nblindness Castelli said, \u201cThe noblest eye is darkened that Nature ever made, \u2014\nan eye that hath seen more than all that went before him, and hath opened the\neyes of all that shall come after him\u201d; of Newton, who made an important\ndiscovery for every one of his eighty-five years; of Bacon, who \u201ctook all\nknowledge to be his province\u201d; of Fontenelle, \u201cthat precious porcelain vase\nlaid up in the centre of France to be guarded with the utmost care for a\nhundred years\u201d; of Franklin, Jefferson, and Adams, the wise and heroic\nstatesmen; of Washington, the perfect citizen; of Wellington, the perfect\nsoldier; of Goethe, the all-knowing poet; of Humboldt, the encyclop\u00e6dia of\nscience.\n\nUnder the general assertion of the well-being of age, we can easily count\nparticular benefits of that condition. It has weathered the perilous capes and\nshoals in the sea whereon we sail, and the chief evil of life is taken away in\nremoving the grounds of fear. The insurance of a ship expires as she enters\nthe harbor at home. It were strange, if a man should turn his sixtieth year\nwithout a feeling of immense relief from the number of dangers he has escaped.\nWhen the old wife says, \u201cTake care of that tumor in your shoulder, perhaps it\nis cancerous,\u201d \u2014 he replies, \u201cWhat if it is?\u201d The humorous thief who drank a\npot of beer at the gallows blew off the froth because he had heard it was\nunhealthy; but it will not add a pang to the prisoner marched out to be shot,\nto assure him that the pain in his knee threatens mortification. When the\npleuro-pneumonia of the cows raged, the butchers said, that, though the acute\ndegree was novel, there never was a time when this disease did not occur among\ncattle. All men carry seeds of all distempers through life latent, and we die\nwithout developing them: such is the affirmative force of the constitution.\nBut if you are enfeebled by any cause, the disease becomes strong. At every\nstage we lose a foe. At fifty years, \u2019t is said, afflicted citizens lose their\nsick-headaches. I hope this hegira is not as movable a feast as that one I\nannually look for, when the horticulturists assure me that the rosebugs in our\ngardens disappear on the tenth of July: they stay a fortnight later in mine.\nBut be it as it may with the sick-headache, \u2014 \u2019t is certain that graver\nheadaches and heart-aches are lulled, once for all, as we come up with certain\ngoals of time. The passions have answered their purpose: that slight, but\ndread overweight, with which, in each instance, Nature secures the execution\nof her aim, drops off. To keep man in the planet, she impresses the terror of\ndeath. To perfect the commissariat, she implants in each a little rapacity to\nget the supply, and a little oversupply, of his wants. To insure the existence\nof the race, she reinforces the sexual instinct, at the risk of disorder,\ngrief, and pain. To secure strength, she plants cruel hunger and thirst, which\nso easily overdo their office, and invite disease. But these temporary stays\nand shifts for the protection of the young animal are shed as fast as they can\nbe replaced by nobler resources. We live in youth amidst this rabble of\npassions, quite too tender, quite too hungry and irritable. Later, the\ninteriors of mind and heart open, and supply grander motives. We learn the\nfatal compensations that wait on every act. Then, \u2014 one mischief at a time, \u2014\nthis riotous time-destroying crew disappear.\n\nI count it another capital advantage of age, this, that a success more or less\nsignifies nothing. Little by little, it has amassed such a fund of merit, that\nit can very well afford to go on its credit when it will. When I chanced to\nmeet the poet Wordsworth, then sixty-three years old, he told me, \u201cthat he had\njust had a fall and lost a tooth, and, when his companions were much concerned\nfor the mischance, he had replied, that he was glad it had not happened forty\nyears before.\u201d Well, Nature takes care that we shall not lose our organs forty\nyears too soon. A lawyer argued a cause yesterday in the Supreme Court, and I\nwas struck with a certain air of levity and defiance which vastly became him.\nThirty years ago it was a serious concern to him whether his pleading was good\nand effective. Now it is of importance to his client, but of none to himself.\nIt is long already fixed what he can do and cannot do, and his reputation does\nnot gain or suffer from one or a dozen new performances. If he should, on a\nnew occasion, rise quite beyond his mark, and do somewhat extraordinary and\ngreat, that, of course, would instantly tell; but he may go below his mark\nwith impunity, and people will say, \u201cOh, he had headache,\u201d or, \u201cHe lost his\nsleep for two nights.\u201d What a lust of appearance, what a load of anxieties\nthat once degraded him, he is thus rid of! Every one is sensible of this\ncumulative advantage in living. All the good days behind him are sponsors, who\nspeak for him when he is silent, pay for him when he has no money, introduce\nhim where he has no letters, and work for him when he sleeps.\n\nA third felicity of age is, that it has found expression. Youth suffers not\nonly from ungratified desires, but from powers untried, and from a picture in\nhis mind of a career which has, as yet, no outward reality. He is tormented\nwith the want of correspondence between things and thoughts. Michel Angelo\u2019s\nhead is full of masculine and gigantic figures as gods walking, which make him\nsavage until his furious chisel can render them into marble; and of\narchitectural dreams, until a hundred stone-masons can lay them in courses of\ntravertine. There is the like tempest in every good head in which some great\nbenefit for the world is planted. The throes continue until the child is born.\nEvery faculty new to each man thus goads him and drives him out into doleful\ndeserts, until it finds proper vent. All the functions of human duty irritate\nand lash him forward, bemoaning and chiding, until they are performed. He\nwants friends, employment, knowledge, power, house and land, wife and\nchildren, honor and fame; he has religious wants, \u00e6sthetic wants, domestic,\ncivil, humane wants. One by one, day after day, he learns to coin his wishes\ninto facts. He has his calling, homestead, social connection, and personal\npower, and thus, at the end of fifty years, his soul is appeased by seeing\nsome sort of correspondence between his wish and his possession. This makes\nthe value of age, the satisfaction it slowly offers to every craving. He is\nserene who does not feel himself pinched and wronged, but whose condition, in\nparticular and in general, allows the utterance of his mind. In old persons,\nwhen thus fully expressed, we often observe a fair, plump, perennial, waxen\ncomplexion, which indicates that all the ferment of earlier days has subsided\ninto serenity of thought and behavior.\n\nFor a fourth benefit, age sets its house in order, and finishes its works,\nwhich to every artist is a supreme pleasure. Youth has an excess of\nsensibility, to which every object glitters and attracts. We leave one pursuit\nfor another, and the young man\u2019s year is a heap of beginnings. At the end of a\ntwelvemonth, he has nothing to show for it, not one completed work. But the\ntime is not lost. Our instincts drove us to hive innumerable experiences, that\nare yet of no visible value, and which we may keep for twice seven years\nbefore they shall be wanted. The best things are of secular growth. The\ninstinct of classifying marks the wise and healthy mind. Linn\u00e6us projects his\nsystem, and lays out his twenty-four classes of plants, before yet he has\nfound in Nature a single plant to justify certain of his classes. His seventh\nclass has not one. In process of time, he finds with delight the little white\nTrientalis, the only plant with seven petals and sometimes seven stamens,\nwhich constitutes a seventh class in conformity with his system. The\nconchologist builds his cabinet whilst as yet he has few shells. He labels\nshelves for classes, cells for species: all but a few are empty. But every\nyear fills some blanks, and with accelerating speed as he becomes knowing and\nknown. An old scholar finds keen delight in verifying all the impressive\nanecdotes and citations he has met with in miscellaneous reading and hearing,\nin all the years of youth. We carry in memory important anecdotes, and have\nlost all clue to the author from whom we had them. We have a heroic speech\nfrom Rome or Greece, but cannot fix it on the man who said it. We have an\nadmirable line worthy of Horace, ever and anon resounding in our mind\u2019s ear,\nbut have searched all probable and improbable books for it in vain. We consult\nthe reading men: but, strangely enough, they who know everything know not\nthis. But especially we have a certain insulated thought, which haunts us, but\nremains insulated and barren. Well, there is nothing for all this but patience\nand time. Time, yes, that is the finder, the unweariable explorer, not subject\nto casualties, omniscient at last. The day comes when the hidden author of our\nstory is found; when the brave speech returns straight to the hero who said\nit; when the admirable verse finds the poet to whom it belongs; and best of\nall, when the lonely thought, which seemed so wise, yet half-wise, half-\nthought, because it cast no light abroad, is suddenly matched in our mind by\nits twin, by its sequence, or next related analogy, which gives it instantly\nradiating power, and justifies the superstitious instinct with which we had\nhoarded it. We remember our old Greek Professor at Cambridge, an ancient\nbachelor, amid his folios, possessed by this hope of completing a task, with\nnothing to break his leisure after the three hours of his daily classes, yet\never restlessly stroking his leg, and assuring himself \u201che should retire from\nthe University and read the authors.\u201d In Goethe\u2019s Romance, Makaria, the\ncentral figure for wisdom and influence, pleases herself with withdrawing into\nsolitude to astronomy and epistolary correspondence. Goethe himself carried\nthis completion of studies to the highest point. Many of his works hung on the\neasel from youth to age, and received a stroke in every month or year of his\nlife. A literary astrologer, he never applied himself to any task but at the\nhappy moment when all the stars consented. Bentley thought himself likely to\nlive till fourscore, \u2014 long enough to read everything that was worth reading,\n\u2014 \u201cEt tune magna mei sub terris ibit imago.\u201d Much wider is spread the pleasure\nwhich old men take in completing their secular affairs, the inventor his\ninventions, the agriculturist his experiments, and all old men in finishing\ntheir houses, rounding their estates, clearing their titles, reducing tangled\ninterests to order, reconciling enmities, and leaving all in the best posture\nfor the future. It must be believed that there is a proportion between the\ndesigns of a man and the length of his life: there is a calendar of his years,\nso of his performances.\n\nAmerica is the country of young men, and too full of work hitherto for leisure\nand tranquillity; yet we have had robust centenarians, and examples of dignity\nand wisdom. I have lately found in an old note-book a record of a visit to Ex-\nPresident John Adams, in 1825, soon after the election of his son to the\nPresidency. It is but a sketch, and nothing important passed in the\nconversation; but it reports a moment in the life of a heroic person, who, in\nextreme old age, appeared still erect, and worthy of his fame.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014, Feb., 1825. To-day, at Quincy, with my brother, by invitation of Mr.\nAdams\u2019s family. The old President sat in a large stuffed arm-chair, dressed in\na blue coat, black small-clothes, white stockings, and a cotton cap covered\nhis bald head. We made our compliment, told him he must let us join our\ncongratulations to those of the nation on the happiness of his house. He\nthanked us, and said, \u201cI am rejoiced, because the nation is happy. The time of\ngratulation and congratulations is nearly over with me: I am astonished that I\nhave lived to see and know of this event. I have lived now nearly a century:\n[he was ninety in the following October:] a long, harassed, and distracted\nlife.\u201d \u2014 I said, \u201cThe world thinks a good deal of joy has been mixed with it.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cThe world does not know,\u201d he replied, \u201chow much toil, anxiety, and sorrow I\nhave suffered.\u201d \u2014 I asked if Mr. Adams\u2019s letter of acceptance had been read to\nhim. \u2014 \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cMy son has more political prudence than any\nman that I know who has existed in my time; he never was put off his guard:\nand I hope he will continue such; but what effect age may work in diminishing\nthe power of his mind, I do not know; it has been very much on the stretch,\never since he was born. He has always been laborious, child and man, from\ninfancy.\u201d \u2014 When Mr. J. Q. Adams\u2019s age was mentioned, he said, \u201cHe is now\nfifty-eight, or will be in July\u201d; and remarked that \u201call the Presidents were\nof the same age: General Washington was about fifty-eight, and I was about\nfifty-eight, and Mr. Jefferson, and Mr. Madison, and Mr. Monroe.\u201d \u2014 We\ninquired, when he expected to see Mr. Adams. \u2014 He said, \u201cNever: Mr. Adams will\nnot come to Quincy, but to my funeral. It would be a great satisfaction to me\nto see him, but I don\u2019t wish him to come on my account.\u201d \u2014 He spoke of Mr.\nLechmere, whom he \u201cwell remembered to have seen come down daily, at a great\nage, to walk in the old townhouse,\u201d \u2014 adding, \u201cAnd I wish I could walk as well\nas he did. He was Collector of the Customs for many years, under the Royal\nGovernment.\u201d \u2014 E. said, \u201cI suppose, Sir, you would not have taken his place,\neven to walk as well as he.\u201d \u2014 \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat was not what I wanted.\u201d\n\u2014 He talked of Whitefield, and \u201cremembered, when he was a Freshman in college,\nto have come in to the Old South, [I think,] to hear him, but could not get\ninto the house; \u2014 I, however, saw him,\u201d he said, \u201cthrough a window, and\ndistinctly heard all. He had a voice such as I never heard before or since. He\ncast it out so that you might hear it at the meeting-house, [pointing towards\nthe Quincy meeting-house,] and he had the grace of a dancing-master, of an\nactor of plays. His voice and manner helped him more than his sermons. I went\nwith Jonathan Sewall.\u201d \u2014 \u201cAnd you were pleased with him, Sir?\u201d \u2014 \u201cPleased! I\nwas delighted beyond measure.\u201d \u2014 We asked, if at Whitefield\u2019s return the same\npopularity continued. \u2014 \u201cNot the same fury,\u201d he said, \u201cnot the same wild\nenthusiasm as before, but a greater esteem, as he became more known. He did\nnot terrify, but was admired.\u201d\n\nWe spent about an hour in his room. He speaks very distinctly for so old a\nman, enters bravely into long sentences, which are interrupted by want of\nbreath, but carries them invariably to a conclusion, without ever correcting a\nword.\n\nHe spoke of the new novels of Cooper, and \u201cPeep at the Pilgrims,\u201d and\n\u201cSaratoga,\u201d with praise, and named with accuracy the characters in them. He\nlikes to have a person always reading to him, or company talking in his room,\nand is better the next day after having visitors in his chamber from morning\nto night.\n\nHe received a premature report of his son\u2019s election, on Sunday afternoon,\nwithout any excitement, and told the reporter he had been hoaxed, for it was\nnot yet time for any news to arrive. The informer, something damped in his\nheart, insisted on repairing to the meeting-house, and proclaimed it aloud to\nthe congregation, who were so overjoyed that they rose in their seats and\ncheered thrice. The Reverend Mr. Whitney dismissed them immediately.\n\nWhen life has been well spent, age is a loss of what it can well spare, \u2014\nmuscular strength, organic instincts, gross bulk, and works that belong to\nthese. But the central wisdom, which was old in infancy, is young in fourscore\nyears, and, dropping off obstructions, leaves in happy subjects the mind\npurified and wise. I have heard that whoever loves is in no condition old. I\nhave heard, that, whenever the name of man is spoken, the doctrine of\nimmortality is announced; it cleaves to his constitution. The mode of it\nbaffles our wit, and no whisper comes to us from the other side. But the\ninference from the working of intellect, hiving knowledge, hiving skill, \u2014 at\nthe end of life just ready to be born, \u2014 affirms the inspirations of affection\nand of the moral sentiment.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson was an essayist, poet, and founder of The Atlantic. He was\na leading figure in the transcendentalist movement and a noted advocate of\nindividualism and emancipation.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
