Declarative WebAssembly Orchestration\n  2. Seamless Distributed Networking\n  3. Vendorless Application Components\n  4. Completely OTEL Observable\n  5. Defense-In-Depth Security By Default\n\nwasmCloud is a universal application platform that helps you build and run\nglobally distributed WebAssembly applications on any cloud and any edge.\nwasmCloud applications are composed of WebAssembly components and capability\nproviders (executable host plugins). wasmCloud hosts can be clustered together\nwith the technology CNCF NATS to form a distributed mesh network called a\nlattice, allowing you to seamlessly distribute applications on any\narchitecture, operating system, virtual or physical machine and communicate\nlike it was running on a single computer.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe v1.0.0 release of wasmCloud is not compatible over the lattice with\nprevious versions of wasmCloud, wash, or wadm. There are a few primary\nbreaking changes that make 1.0 incompatible:\n\n  1. Topic changes in the control interface for backwards compatibility #1108\n  2. RPC protocol change from wasmbus to wRPC #1548\n  3. Removal of support for Smithy-based modules and wasmCloud contracts in favor of WebAssembly components and WIT\n\nThis includes renaming actor to component in many places in the code.\n\nFor these reasons, it\u2019s recommended to update all wasmCloud hosts that you run\nto v1.0.0 at the same time. Associated tooling like wadm should update to at\nleast version v0.11.0 as well in order to match the protocol versions.\n\n## Migrating from v0.82\n\nUpdating wash to v0.27.0 will include wasmCloud v1.0.0 and wadm v0.11.0,\nbundling all associated tooling together for a quick upgrade. If you deploy\nwasmCloud via the helm chart or using the container, updating to wasmCloud\nv1.0.0 should be all you need.\n\n### If you use wash in your CI/scripts/workflows\n\nThe primary changes in wash center around the addition of component IDs, and\nthe changes to links and configuration.\n\n  1. Any scripts that start, scale, or stop components or providers should update to also include a component ID (wash start actor myoci.io/echo:0.1.0 \u2192 wash start component myoci.io/echo:0.1.0 )\n  2. Any scripts that linked an actor to a provider should re-examine the link, and change to support the WIT interface link format. See the Link changes section of the wadm documentation for more information. Configuration that is specified as a link value can now be externalized and specified via wash config .\n\n### If you use wadm to deploy your applications\n\nPlease see the Migrating from v0.82 section in the wadm documentation for\ndetails on updating application manifests.\n\n### If you use Smithy-generated actors or capability providers\n\nThese actors and capability providers were deprecated in v0.82, and support is\nofficially removed in v1.0.0. We recommend reaching out using the contact\nmethods below if you need assistance migrating from these interfaces.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n  * When using the HTTPServer provider, you may see warnings about failed health checks but this is a false positive #1925\n  * Component_scaled events are published twice when a component stops #1888\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nA huge thank you to the wasmCloud community for participating in design\ndiscussions, attending community meetings, testing the release candidate, and\nhelping us make distributed WebAssembly applications easy and fun. Thank you\nto all of the maintainers of the wasmCloud project for the massive effort\ncoordinating and testing for this release. \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you\u2019re testing, updating, or just trying out v1.0.0 for the first time,\nplease reach out to us in the associated GitHub discussion or on our Slack.\nCome join the community!\n\nwash v0.27.0 will be released shortly to package this release.\n\n## What's Changed\n\n  * build(nix): update dependencies by @wasmcloud-nix-flake-updater in #1517\n  * build(deps): Bump github/codeql-action from 3.24.0 to 3.24.1 by @dependabot in
