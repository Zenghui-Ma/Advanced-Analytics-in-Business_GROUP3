Driven by neural network\npolicies, our simple, unified control system enables smooth gait transitions,\nsmart navigation planning, and highly responsive obstacle avoidance in\npopulated urban environments. With the Swiss-Mile prototype robot, we have\nconducted kilometer-scale missions for months and proved the feasibility of\nour system for real-world applications.
