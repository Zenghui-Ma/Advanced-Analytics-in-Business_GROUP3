GitHub is the\nlargest code host in the world, with 40 million users and more than 190\nmillion repositories as of January 2020. By analyzing how languages are used\nin GitHub it's possible to understand the popularity of programming languages\namong developers and to discover the unique characteristics of each language.\nGitHub provides a public API to interact with its huge dataset of events and\ninteraction with the hosted repositories. The GitHub Archive project goes one\nstep further by aggregating and storing the API data over time. The\nquantitative data used in GitHut 2.0 is collected from the GitHub Archive\ndataset via Google BigQuery.\n\nThe language percentage distribution in the line chart shows the top 10 (or\nmanually selected) languages since 2012/Q2. The ranking table shows the top 50\nlanguages of the last quarter. The percentage values are the actual fractions\nof pull requests, pushes, stars or issues in relation to the top 50 languages\nin the table. The YoY change shows the difference in percentage compared to\nthe same time period last year. The YoY trend arrows indicate the change in\nranking. Two arrows up/down stands for more than three ranks up/down within\none year. No arrow indicates that nothing has changed and one arrow fills the\ngap. Please note that it is possible that the ranking shown in the table does\nnot match the chart ranking, since they are calculated over a different time\nperiod (quarter vs. full history). Please also note that there is not enough\ndata available in the GitHub Archive dataset to calculate a statistical\naccurate ranking table or chart for any time period before 2012/Q2.\n\n#### Related Work\n\n  * TIOBE Programming Community Index is a measure of popularity of programming languages, created and maintained by the TIOBE Company based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.\n  * The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings are derived from a correlation of programming traction on GitHub and Stack Overflow.\n  * The PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language Index is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google.\n\nCredits to Carlo Zapponi This work is licensed under the GNU Affero General\nPublic License\n\n", "frontpage": false}
