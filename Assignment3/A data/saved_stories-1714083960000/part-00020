The results shocked me: Half the population just taps away. Do you?\nRead on for details and speculation.\n\nThis ongoing fragment embeds links to previous fragments, because I\u2019ve been\nworrying and writing about this problem for a long time. Which in itself is\ninteresting, more evidence that the problem is hard.\n\nThe poll post and (long) chain of responses are here on Mastodon.\n\nPeople care \u00b7 First, 3.5K poll responses is more than I usually see on the\nFediverse; evidence that plenty of people have feelings about this. To\nreinforce that impression, scroll down through the responses (there are\ndozens). Many say, essentially, \u201cEntering text on a mobile device is too hard,\nso I don\u2019t.\u201d \u00b6\n\nI\u2019m one of those; I regularly start entering a message into a phone, stop, get\nup, and walk across the room to a real keyboard.\n\nTap tap wow \u00b7 I widened my eyes when I saw that half the respondents testify\nto tapping along letter by letter. I could never. But then I have big fat\nfarmer\u2019s fingers with soft ends, and am not terribly dextrous. \u00b6\n\nBut, probably, I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised; 21 years ago in this blog I\nremarked that \u201cit's pretty impressive to watch a Japanese person pounding text\ninto their PDA at high speed using just their thumbs.\u201d And today I watch\nteenage digits dance on devices like maddened maenads; they seem not to find\nit tedious.\n\nSwiping etc \u00b7 A quarter of poll respondents reported swiping words into their\nphones. \u00b6\n\nI mentioned above that people have been working on this for a long time. Check\nout this progress report from ongoing in 2011. It\u2019s worth noting that\nAndroid\u2019s input method being replaceable was important in driving this\ninnovation.\n\nMy own proposal, the Digitator, has failed to break through.\n\nThat piece concludes \u201cAnyhow, I\u2019m pretty sure that something will come along.\u201d\nBut on the evidence it hasn\u2019t, really.\n\nThe AI angle: Auto-predict and voice \u00b7 The least popular poll options were\ntap-plus-autopredict and voice. I guess I\u2019m weird, because those are what I\nmostly use. I suspect many others should too but don\u2019t, probably because they\ntried those things a while ago and haven\u2019t revisited them recently. \u00b6\n\nIn my experience (which, granted, is almost all on Google Pixel devices) the\nautopredict and voice options have gotten stronger with almost every release.\nNot just a little bit stronger, either. Perhaps it\u2019s just because I\u2019m the\nwhite male Anglophone \u201ccanonical human\u201d that designers build for, but I get\ndramatically better results than I used to.\n\nNow obviously, most reasonable people will only talk to their phone when\nthey\u2019re in a private place, which limits the use of that option. But if you\ncan find privacy, the voice option is getting remarkably good.\n\nWhich is to say, I can enter message or email text in at a pace that is\nsometimes adequate. Do I enjoy doing this? No, I hate it, as I noted above,\nand will make a real effort to switch to a keyboard.\n\nIn particular if what I want to enter is important, might matter.\n\nBecause anything that matters deserves editing, and it\u2019s rare indeed that I\nhit \u201cSend\u201d on a first draft. And while brute-force text entry is edging into\nadequacy, editing remains a pool of pain.\n\nSubtext \u00b7 Two and a half decades into this millennium, the most popular\ncommunication products are optimized for consumption and barely adequate for\ncreation. If I were paranoid and cynical, I might suspect that this is no\naccident. Oh wait, I am. But in fact I think it\u2019s just a hard problem. \u00b6\n\nUpdated: 2024/04/25\n\nongoing\n\nWhat this is \u00b7 Truth \u00b7 Biz \u00b7 Tech\n\nauthor \u00b7 Dad colophon \u00b7 rights\n\nApril 24, 2024 \u00b7 The World (149 fragments) \u00b7 \u00b7 Social Media (13 more) \u00b7\nTechnology (90 fragments) \u00b7 \u00b7 Text (4 more)\n\nBy Tim Bray.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are my own, and no other party necessarily agrees\nwith them.\n\nA full disclosure of my professional interests is on the author page.\n\nI\u2019m on Mastodon!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
