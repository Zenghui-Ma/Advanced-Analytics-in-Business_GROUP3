This\nnew, more detailed analysis shows that the strong cooling over the northern\noceans, caused by the North American ice sheet, contributed substantially to\ntotal global cooling. The right panel shows that the warming of the ocean's\nsurface expected under future doubling of atmospheric CO_2 displays a\ndifferent pattern of temperature change, with a lower expectation for globally\naveraged warming than previous worst-case estimates.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adk9461\n\nAs carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere, the Earth will get hotter.\nBut exactly how much warming will result from a certain increase in CO_2 is\nunder study. The relationship between CO_2 and warming, known as climate\nsensitivity, determines what future we should expect as CO_2 levels continue\nto climb.\n\nNew research led by the University of Washington analyzes the most recent ice\nage, when a large swath of North America was covered in ice, to better\nunderstand the relationship between CO_2 and global temperature. It finds that\nwhile most future warming estimates remain unchanged, the absolute worst-case\nscenario is unlikely.\n\nThe open-access study was published April 17 in Science Advances.\n\n\"The main contribution from our study is narrowing the estimate of climate\nsensitivity, improving our ability to make future warming projections,\" said\nlead author Vince Cooper, a UW doctoral student in atmospheric sciences. \"By\nlooking at how much colder Earth was in the ancient past with lower levels of\ngreenhouse gases, we can estimate how much warmer the current climate will get\nwith higher levels of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe new paper doesn't change the best-case warming scenario from doubling\nCO_2\u2014about 2 degrees Celsius average temperature increase worldwide\u2014or the\nmost likely estimate, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. But it reduces the\nworst-case scenario for doubling of CO_2 by a full degree, from 5 degrees\nCelsius to 4 degrees Celsius. (For reference, CO_2 is currently at 425 ppm, or\nabout 1.5 times preindustrial levels, and unless emissions drop is headed\ntoward double preindustrial levels before the end of this century.)\n\nAs our planet heads toward a doubling of CO_2, the authors caution that the\nrecent decades are not a good predictor of the future under global warming.\nShorter-term climate cycles and atmospheric pollution's effects are just some\nreasons that recent trends can't reliably predict the rest of this century.\n\n\"The spatial pattern of global warming in the most recent 40 years doesn't\nlook like the long-term pattern we expect in the future\u2014the recent past is a\nbad analog for future global warming,\" said senior author Kyle Armour, a UW\nassociate professor of atmospheric sciences and of oceanography.\n\nThis artist's rendition shows woolly mammoths in northern Spain. These animals\nlived in Europe and North America during the last glacial period, around\n21,000 years ago. A new study used updated climate maps from that period, when\natmospheric carbon dioxide was lower, to better predict future warming under\nrising CO_2.

Ice core records show that atmospheric CO_2 then was less than half of\ntoday's levels, at about 190 parts per million.\n\n\"The paleoclimate record includes long periods that were on average much\nwarmer or colder than the current climate, and we know that there were big\nclimate forcings from ice sheets and greenhouse gases during those periods,\"\nCooper said. \"If we know roughly what the past temperature changes were and\nwhat caused them, then we know what to expect in the future.\"\n\nResearchers including co-author Gregory Hakim, a UW professor of atmospheric\nsciences, have created new statistical modeling techniques that allow\npaleoclimate records to be assimilated into computer models of Earth's\nclimate, similar to today's weather forecasting models. The result is more\nrealistic temperature maps from previous millennia.\n\nFor the new study the authors combined prehistoric climate records\u2014including\nocean sediments, ice cores, and preserved pollen\u2014with computer models of\nEarth's climate to simulate the weather of the Last Glacial Maximum. When much\nof North America was covered with ice, the ice sheet didn't just cool the\nplanet by reflecting summer sunlight off the continents, as previous studies\nhad considered.\n\nBy altering wind patterns and ocean currents, the ice sheet also caused the\nnorthern Pacific and Atlantic oceans to become especially cold and cloudy.\nAnalysis in the new study shows that these cloud changes over the oceans\ncompounded the glacier's global cooling effects by reflecting even more\nsunlight.\n\nIn short, the study shows that CO_2 played a smaller role in setting ice age\ntemperatures than previously estimated. The flipside is that the most dire\npredictions for warming from rising CO_2 are less likely over coming decades.\n\n\"This paper allows us to produce more confident predictions because it really\nbrings down the upper end of future warming, and says that the most extreme\nscenario is less likely,\" Armour said. \"It doesn't really change the lower\nend, or the average estimate, which remain consistent with all the other lines\nof evidence.\"\n\nMore information: Vincent Cooper et al, Last Glacial Maximum pattern effects\nreduce climate sensitivity estimates, Science Advances (2024).
