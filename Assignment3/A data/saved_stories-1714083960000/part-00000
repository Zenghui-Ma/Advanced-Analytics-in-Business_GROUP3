and most powerful - waterfall\nto be almost as dry as a desert.\n\nIn June 1969, U.S. engineers diverted the flow of the Niagara River away from\nthe American side of the falls for several months.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nStark: A completely dry Niagara Falls has never been seen before or since the\nsix months in July 1969 when U.S. engineers set about restructuring the\nAmerican side of the twin landmark\n\nMountain of rubble: This set of photos only recently came to light when Russ\nGlasson found them in a shoebox in his in-laws' Connecticut garage\n\nTheir plan was to remove the large amount of loose rock from the base of the\nwaterfall, an idea which they eventually abandoned due to expense in November\nof that year.\n\nTRENDING\n\nYear 9 girl who 'tried to stab teacher was in trouble in class before'\n\n2.7k viewing now\n\nHarvey Weinstein cried tears of joy when court overturned convictions\n\n1.5k viewing now\n\nKremlin says NATO nukes deployed in Poland would be 'primary target'\n\n4.9k viewing now\n\nDuring the interim, they studied the riverbed and mechanically bolted and\nstrengthened a number of faults to delay the gradual erosion of the American\nFalls.\n\nThe team, made up of U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, blew up their temporary dam\nin November 1969 and six million cubic feet of water once again thundered over\nthe falls' sides every minute.\n\nNow, after lying unseen for more than four decades, a set of images showing\nthe eerie calm at the American Falls that year have been unearthed by a man\nfrom Connecticut.\n\nPlan: The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers studied the riverbed and mechanically\nbolted and strengthened a number of faults to delay the gradual erosion of the\nAmerican Falls\n\nHistorical moment: In order to stop the Niagara River running over the\nAmerican Falls, engineers constructed a dam consisting of 27,800 tons of rock,\nstopping the water for the first time in 12,000 years\n\nRuss Glasson recently stumbled across the pictures, which were taken by his\nin-laws, and had been left in an old shoebox in their garage for over four\ndecades.\n\nMr Glasson said: 'My in-laws took these pictures during the six months through\nJune to November that the Army was working to improve the health of the\nAmerican Falls.'\n\nTwo rockslides from the plate of the falls in 1931 and 1954 had caused a large\namount of rock to be collected at the base.\n\nIn 1965, reporters at local newspaper Niagara Falls Gazette revealed that the\nAmerica Falls would eventually cease to flow and stop altogether if the rocks\nwere not removed.\n\nFour years later, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers were charged with de-\nwatering the falls to clean the river bed and to remove any loose rock at the\nbottom of the falls.\n\nGradual deterioration: Two rockslides from the plate of the falls in 1931 and\n1954 had caused a large amount of rock to be collected at the base\n\nEerie calm: The temporary dam can be seen in the top-right of this photograph\n\nThunderous: The American Falls as they normally appear, with millions of\ngallons of water hurtling over the edge every minute\n\nTo achieve this the army had to build a 600ft dam across the Niagara River,\nwhich meant that 60,000 gallons of water that flowed ever second was diverted\nover the larger Horseshoe Falls which flow entirely on the Canadian side of\nthe border.\n\nThe dam itself consisted of 27,800 tons of rock, and on June 12, 1969, after\nflowing continuously for over 12,000 years, the American Falls stopped.\n\nOver the course of the next six months thousands of visitors flocked to the\nfalls to witness the historic occasion.\n\nOnce the engineers had removed the collected rocks from the falls base and\nmade geological testing to make safe the rest, the falls were re-watered on\nNovember 25 in front of 2,650 onlookers.\n\nTourist hotspot: The Maid Of The Mist cruise boat journeys near to the\nCanadian Falls.
