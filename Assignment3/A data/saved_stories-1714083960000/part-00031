My thoughts are flighty and\nshapeless; they morph as I approach them. But when I type, it is as if I pin\nmy thoughts to the table. I can examine them. They feel porous to the touch\nand crumble. But among the fragments, I discover things I\u2019ve been blind to.\n\nBut it is hard to do it right. Not all writing helps me think. Most kinds of\nwriting are rather weak, or even counterproductive, in this regard. You have\nto approach it in the right way.\n\nUntil last fall, I had not seen anyone properly articulate the mental moves\nthat make writing a powerful tool for thought. Writing advice is usually\nfocused on more superficial parts of the craft. Whatever I knew about thinking\non the page, I had picked up through trial and error and conversations with\nother writers.\n\nBut then I read Imre Lakatos\u2019s Proofs and Refutations. It is not, at first\nglance, a book about writing. It is a book of mathematical philosophy. By a\nHungarian Stalinist, no less. But it is, if you read it sideways, a profound\nexploration of the act of writing. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Mathematics\nis, after all, a subset of writing\u2014it is a way of crafting a language that\nhelps you express and improve thoughts. The main difference, compared to prose\nwriters and poets, is that mathematicians are more rigorous, precise. Because\nof this precision, reading Lakatos gave me a clearer and more precise\nunderstanding of what I do, or strive to do, as I sit down each morning and\nwrestle with my thoughts.\n\nWhat follows is a series of meditations about thinking through writing\nprovoked by, but not faithful to, Lakatos\u2019s book. I\u2019ve divided it into two\nparts. The first part covers the basic mental models that are useful to most\npeople (if you write a diary, for example, and want to get clarity about\nthings in your life). The next part goes into more complex patterns of\nthinking which I suspect is mostly useful if you do research or engage in some\nother kind of deep creative work.\n\nA warning. If you aim to write and publish stuff, this essay might tie you up\nin knots. It is about thinking, not about crafting beauty or finishing things\nin a finite time.\n\n#\n\nSetting yourself up for defeat\n\nIn a recent interview with Dwarkesh, Patrick Collison explained the value of\nwriting using a metaphor I enjoyed:\n\n> Bruno Latour spoke about how he thinks the printing revolution, like\n> Gutenberg\u2019s, partially caused the scientific revolution by making knowledge\n> more rigid. Before, if some observation didn\u2019t match some claim, you could\n> always shrug and be like: \u201cWell, the person who transcribed that thing made\n> a mistake.\u201d So by making things more rigid, it\u2019s easier to break them.\n> [Emphasis mine.]\n\nGood thinking is about pushing past your current understanding and reaching\nthe thought behind the thought. This often requires breaking old ideas, which\nis much easier to do when the ideas are as rigid as they get on the page. In a\nfluid medium like thought or conversation, you can always go, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t\nmean it like that\u201d or rely on the fact that your short-term memory is too\nlimited for you to notice the contradiction between what you are saying now\nand what you said 12 minutes ago.\n\nWhen I write, I get to observe the transition from this fluid mode of thinking\nto the rigid. As I type, I\u2019m often in a fluid mode\u2014writing at the speed of\nthought. I feel confident about what I\u2019m saying. But as soon as I stop, the\nthoughts solidify, rigid on the page, and, as I read what I\u2019ve written, I see\ncracks spreading through my ideas. What seemed right in my head fell to pieces\non the page.\n\nSeeing your ideas crumble can be a frustrating experience, but it is the point\nif you are writing to think. You want it to break. It is in the cracks the\nlight shines in.\n\nWhen I write, I push myself to make definite positive claims. Ambiguity allows\nthought to remain fluid on the page, floating into a different meaning when\nput under pressure. This makes it harder to push your thinking deeper. By\nmaking clear and sharp claims, I reveal my understanding so that I\u2014or the\nperson I\u2019m writing to\u2014can see the state of my knowledge and direct their\nfeedback to the point where it will help my thinking improve.\n\nThis is valuable to do even in areas where you know way too little to\n\u201cwarrant\u201d an opinion. I met a Japanese linguist in the harbor yesterday and\ntalked about the relationship between the Chinese and the Japanese writing\nsystems. This is a topic I had thought about for about twenty seconds before\nthis. \u201cSo,\u201d I said after two minutes, \u201cthis is a stupid question, but is the\nrelationship between China and Japan like that between Ancient Greece and the\nRoman Empire?\u201d This is, as it turns out, not a good analogy. But by spelling\nout my naive understanding, I gave the linguist a good area to work on when he\nlaid out a richer model of the flow of cultural influence in East Asia.\n\nIn the terminology of mathematics, what I did here (and in my writing) was to\n\u201cmake a conjecture,\u201d a qualified guess based on limited information. A\nhypothesis. The mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, whom Johanna and I have\nwritten about elsewhere, would always summarize his first impression of a new\nsituation with a conjecture, proclaiming with irrepressible enthusiasm, \u201cIt\nmust be true!\u201d Ten seconds later, someone would come up with a counterexample\nthat proved him wrong. But being right wasn\u2019t the point: getting a better\nunderstanding was. And he would immediately throw out a new conjecture.\n(Holden Karnofsky has a blog post about using this technique to learn through\nwriting.)\n\nForcing the diffuse ideas and impressions in your head into a definite\nstatement is an art form. You have to grab hold of what is floating and make\nit rigid and sharp. It can feel almost embarrassing\u2013revealing your ignorance\nwith as much vulnerability as possible.\n\nAnd it is only the first step. Once you have made your thoughts definite,\nclear, concrete, sharp, and rigid, you also want to unfold them.\n\nEscaping Flatland is a reader-enabled publication. If you like it, consider\nbecoming a paid subscriber :)\n\n#\n\nSpreading the frontline until it snaps\n\nBy unfolding I mean \u201cinterrogating the conclusion to come up with an\nexplanation of why it could be true.\u201d What premises and reasoning chains leads\nto this conclusion? The explanation isn\u2019t meant to prove that your conclusion\nwas right. It is just a way of unpacking it.\n\nBy unfolding a claim into an explanation, you spread it on a \u201cwider front\u201d (to\nborrow a metaphor from Lakatos), so that the criticism has more targets.\n\nI used this tactic in the food store yesterday. Maud, our six-year-old, told\nme we had to get a pink miniature plastic teapot. I couldn\u2019t come up with a\ncompassionate counterargument, so I said, \u201cWhy do you think a plastic teapot\nis so great?\u201d And she said, \u201cBecause it is so beautiful. And I need one in\nplastic so it doesn\u2019t break. I would use it all the time.\u201d This brought a\nsmile to my face. See\u2014trying to prove her point, she had given me three times\nas many claims to attack!\n\nSince the goal is to find flaws in our guesses (so that we can change our\nminds, refine our mental models and our language, and be more right) unfolding\na claim through an explanation is progress. Even if the explanation is wrong.\n\n> You are interested only in proofs which \u2018prove\u2019 what they have set out to\n> prove. I am interested in proofs even if they do not accomplish their\n> intended task. Columbus did not reach India but he discovered something\n> interesting. \u2014Lakatos\n\nLet me take another example. Before Maud was born, Johanna and I worked as\nteachers in Sweden. The first conclusion we drew from that experience was that\nwe didn\u2019t want to submit our kids to what we had observed. This way of\nformulating it (\u201cNot that\u201d) is a bit vague as it only defines where not to\nlook for the solution. It is useful to also attempt a positive formulation. If\nI were to reconstruct the positive version of our conclusion back then, it was\nsomething like, \u201cWe need to find (or start) a school where our daughter can\npursue her interests at her pace.\u201d\n\nThere are several subtle problems with this conclusion. But the point is\u2014these\nproblems didn\u2019t come into view until we had unfolded and probed our original\nposition.\n\nThe way we unfolded and improved our conclusion back then was more haphazard\nthan it would have been today. We just talked about it aimlessly, read\nrandomly, and made small notes. This cost us time and caused confusion. These\ndays, I would instead unfold a conclusion like this as a series of bullet\npoints where I spell out the intuition behind my claim in a series of\npremises. In the case of Maud\u2019s education, this would have looked something\nlike this (note that this is not my current understanding but a reconstruction\nof what I thought eight years ago):\n\n  * People have an intrinsic motivation to learn and it is important to not undermine that, which schools do\n\n  * It is better to go deep on a few topics that you are passionate about rather than have a superficial understanding of a broad range of subjects you care little about\n\n  * But you need to attend a school so you get socialized\n\n  * Hence, we need to find a school that allows self-directed learning\n\nOnce I unfold my understanding in writing, I often see holes right away. I\nstart correcting myself and discarding ideas already while typing. I cut ideas\nthat are obviously flawed. I rewrite what feels ambiguous to make it\nsharper\u2013more precise, concrete, unhedged, and true to my understanding.\n\nThe flaws I see immediately, however, are only the more superficial flaws. The\ndeeper patterns take a longer time to emerge\u2014because they are further from\nyour established thoughts and so are harder to articulate.\n\nOften, they occur first as subtle emotional cues. As I reread a passage, I\nnotice a slight tension across my chest or my eyes fog over. For some reason,\nit doesn\u2019t feel right. There is something wrong here.\n\nThese subtle feelings are easy to dismiss (\u201cEh, words are slippery, I mean\nsomething slightly different . . . there is no reason to obsess about this\u201d).\nBut in my experience, it is these subtler problems that tend to open a path\nbeyond my current understanding. I learned this from my wife, Johanna, who\nwill often sit with a draft for several hours, not writing or editing, but\nsimply articulating why something feels off to her. Our best essays have come\nout of the things she surfaced during those sessions.\n\nFor this reason, I suspect that many of my friends who write and publish\nrapidly are shortchanging themselves. They generate texts filled with hidden\ndoors and move on before they\u2019ve opened them.\n\nI tend to go through my list of premises and assumptions and ask follow-up\nquestions to myself, to further unfold my conclusion. To continue the example\nfrom above, I would take one of the premises and unfold it like this:\n\n  * But you need a school so you get socialized\n\n    * Curious: why?\n\n    * Kids will get depressed and struggle to navigate workplaces, and so on, if they haven\u2019t been exposed to society\n\n      * Where can I read more about this? Are there any good studies?\n\n    * Being in something like a school is important because humans are social animals. We pick up most of our skills and norms and so on by being immersed in a peer group\n\n      * And what follows from this?\n\n      * If we are shaped by our peer group, what would the ideal peer group look like?\n\nThe emotional tone of these questions is, in my head, lovingly curious; I\u2019m\nnot trying to put myself down. I\u2019m trying not to kill ideas. I want to help\nthem evolve and spill forth more insight. Often this dialogue ends with me\nchanging my mind about several premises and coming to a different conclusion,\nbut the original idea remains the seed\u2014no less valuable for having been proven\nwrong. It takes creativity and boldness to leap out and form a conclusion, and\nthe part that criticizes must understand how dependent it is on the part that\nthrows ideas at the wall. It is often easier to criticize than it is to\nsynthesize a new position.\n\n#\n\nCounterexamples, local and global\n\nThe sun is above the horizon now, the satellites hid behind a thin layer of\norange and pink. A hare raises on his hind legs in the middle of the meadow\nlooking around. I tap the glass and watch his ears turn my way.\n\nNow that I have spelled out my position and fixed the obvious flaws, I start\nprobing myself more seriously to see if I can get the argument to break down.\n\nIf one of the premises I have unfolded is a factual claim, I\u2019ll spend a few\nminutes skimming research in the area to see how well my position holds up.\n\u201cOh, it turns out that most homeschooled kids do not have any problems with\nsocialization!\u201d I realized when doing this in relation to Maud\u2019s education.\n(Though it didn\u2019t take me a few minutes, it took me years in this case. Partly\nbecause we were unsystematic, partly because homeschooling is illegal and\ntaboo in Sweden and this had worked itself into my body so that I felt\nrevulsion each time I probed that assumption.) In this case, looking at\nstudies and statistics helped remove several needless assumptions. We changed\nour conclusion (we left Sweden and now homeschool Maud and her sister).\n\nBut often the type of problem I like to think about is too personal and messy\nand qualitative to be resolved cleanly through a statistically significant\nstudy. What I do in these situations instead is to consider counterexamples.\n\nI like to visualize concrete situations when I make an argument (in the notes\nfor this essay, for example, I continually compare what I say against past\nwriting projects). This makes it easier for me to think clearly. I am tied\nback into a lived reality, which is rigid, and do not float off into theory,\nwhere I have a solid track record of fooling myself. When I have a concrete\nsituation in mind, I can ask myself, \u201cWhat is a situation where the opposite\nhappened? Why was that?\u201d I can list the characteristics of the situation that\ninform my conclusion and then systematically look for cases that have other\ncharacteristics. In \u201cChildhoods of exceptional people,\u201d for example, I wrote\nabout parenting from the perspective of concrete biographies. The sample was\nunsystematic. But once I had extracted what I thought were the common\npatterns, I asked myself, \u201cSo whom does this not apply to?\u201d Then I added the\npeople that came to mind to the sample and ended up with a distribution that\nwas good enough for my purposes.\n\nCounterexamples are useful in two ways. Either you find a counterexample that\na) proves one of the premises wrong but b) does not change your mind about the\nconclusion. Lakatos calls this a local (and non-global) counterexample. This\nmeans there is something wrong with your unfolding. Perhaps you need to change\nthat part of the explanation? Or perhaps you can simply drop it, making the\nmental model simpler and more general? Local counterexamples help you improve\nyour explanation and get a better understanding.\n\nThere is a scene in the last season of Breaking Bad that illustrates this. The\nmain character, whatever his name was, is a teacher that starts a meth lab.\nThis can be thought of as his conclusion (\u201cI should get into the meth\nbusiness\u201d) and when asked to defend this decision he unfolds the claim by\nsaying, \u201cI need to support my family.\u201d This is false. There are better ways\nfor him to do that (he has an old friend who offers him money). That is a\nlocal counterexample. In the final season, he admits to himself: \u201cI did it\nbecause it made me feel alive.\u201d This doesn\u2019t change his conclusion (he does\nnot change his mind about the meth) but it gives him a deeper and more correct\nunderstanding of himself.\n\nOther times, the counterexample you find undermines the whole idea\u2014a global\ncounterexample. You unfold your conclusion and discover that one of the\npremises does not hold up, and there is no way to patch it. The fracture\nspreads right up to the conclusion. Now\u2014this is what we have been longing\nfor\u2014there is a big hole of confusion where before there was a mental model. It\nis time to replace it with something more subtle and deep that incorporates\nthe critique.\n\nHow to do this, and do it in the most interesting way possible, is the topic\nof the next part.\n\nIf you liked this, you might enjoy this one too:\n\n## Be patient with problems\n\nHenrik Karlsson\n\n\u00b7\n\nOctober 17, 2023\n\nThe Abyss of Hell, Sandro Botticelli, ca 1480\n\nRead full story\n\n20 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to think in writing\n\nwww.henrikkarlsson.xyz\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nLooking for Alice\n\nNot dating\n\nJan 17, 2023 \u2022\n\nHenrik Karlsson\n\n911\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Looking for Alice\n\nwww.henrikkarlsson.xyz\n\n53\n\nChildhoods of exceptional people\n\nLet's do more of those\n\nFeb 6, 2023 \u2022\n\nHenrik Karlsson\n\n624\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Childhoods of exceptional people\n\nwww.henrikkarlsson.xyz\n\n61\n\nDostoevsky as lover\n\nLooking for Alice, part 2\n\nApr 25, 2023 \u2022\n\nHenrik Karlsson\n\n266\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Dostoevsky as lover\n\nwww.henrikkarlsson.xyz\n\n20\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Henrik Karlsson\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
