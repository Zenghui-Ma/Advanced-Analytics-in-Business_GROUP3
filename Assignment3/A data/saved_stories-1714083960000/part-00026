Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who\ncovers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The\nNew York Daily News and City & State.\n\nApr 24, 2024, 3:52 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nImage: Getty\n\nDuring last night\u2019s earnings call with investors, Elon Musk threw out an all-\ntime late-night dorm room bong sesh of an idea: what if AWS, but for Tesla?\n\nMusk, who loves to riff on earnings calls, compared the unused compute power\nof millions of idle Tesla vehicles to Amazon\u2019s cloud service business. If\nthey\u2019re just sitting there, he mused, why not put them to good use to run AI\nmodels? (Also, have you ever really looked at your hands? No, I mean really\nlooked?)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a potential... when the car is not moving to actually run distributed\ninference,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIf you imagine the future perhaps where there\u2019s a\nfleet of 100 million Teslas and on average, they\u2019ve got like maybe a kilowatt\nof inference compute. That\u2019s 100 gigawatts of inference compute, distributed\nall around the world.\u201d\n\nSo, to summarize, you buy a Tesla. It\u2019s your property. But Musk wants to\nfreely use the unused compute power in your vehicle for... something? Possibly\nAI-related? Hopefully not the blockchain. (Tesla is an AI company now, by the\nway. Musk said so himself during the call.)\n\nWould Tesla pay you for this? Unclear\n\nWould Tesla pay you for this? Unclear. After all, this is Musk at his most\nhypothetical. Still, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to just try to take compute\npower from his customers\u2019 vehicles without consent or compensation. GM was\ngiving your driving data to insurance companies without your consent! Baby,\nit\u2019s a free-for-all.\n\nBut before we can even treat this as a serious idea, we need to figure out if\nit\u2019s even possible. I reached out to Sam Anthony, former chief technology\nofficer at Perceptive Automata, a now-defunct company that built modules for\nself-driving cars to allow them to do \u201ctheory of mind\u201d tasks.\n\nAnthony said, as a concept, it\u2019s \u201cperfectly possible\u201d to split large computing\ntasks out over lots of small nodes. We\u2019ve seen it done with Bitcoin mining or\nFolding@home, a distributed computing project to develop new therapeutics. But\njust because something is possible doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a good idea.\n\nAnthony said there are two main issues that make cars \u2014 and electric cars, in\nparticular \u2014 imperfect nodes for a distributed computing project. First, you\nhave to rely on the car\u2019s battery, or if it\u2019s plugged in, the charging\nstation\u2019s energy source, for power. And that power usually doesn\u2019t come free,\nwith owners paying retail rates for electricity. Second, connectivity and\nspeed are a \u201cbig issue\u201d in distributed computing, Anthony said.\n\n\u201cInference in particular is a part of the [machine learning] workflow where\nyour speed is essential.\u201d\n\n\u201cInference in particular is a part of the [machine learning] workflow where\nyour speed is essential,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing a ton of offline\ninference overnight, you\u2019re answering questions as they\u2019re asked \u2014 this is the\nbig inference issue the AI companies are running into right now \u2014 which makes\nthe connectivity and availability issues of cars (which, you know, move\naround) even more of an issue.\u201d\n\nIn Musk\u2019s mind, the distributed network would only work when the cars are\nparked or otherwise immobile. Still, Anthony argues that no one would\nwillingly create a distributed computer architecture out of millions of car\nECUs (electronic control units) unless they were somehow forced to do it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somebody with a very weird looking hammer imagining the existence of\ndeeply implausible nails,\u201d he said.\n\nTo be sure, computer scientists have been trying to create fast computers out\nof many small, idle nodes for a very long time. One of the earliest examples\nwas SETI@home, in which Berkeley researchers thought they could find\nextraterrestrial life by tapping a volunteer network of distributed computers\nto analyze radio data. So why not a Tesla@home?\n\nTo be sure, computer scientists have been trying to create fast computers out\nof many small, idle nodes for a very long time\n\nFor one thing, the more geographically distributed the nodes, the harder it is\nto get them to work in concert with one another, said Phil Koopman, a\nprofessor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University\nwho co-authored a book about supercomputers.\n\nLike Anthony, Koopman acknowledged that the project could work as long as the\nvehicles were plugged in while computing to avoid draining the battery. Good\nWi-Fi was also a necessary component, so the Tesla would likely need to be\nparked at home overnight for the distributed network to function properly. But\neven then, you\u2019d likely run into obstacles while growing the project in order\nto make it useful for AI computing.\n\n\u201cScalability to that size is always challenging and rarely succeeds to the\ndegree it is worth doing that instead of building a data center,\u201d Koopman\nsaid. \u201cThe devil is in the details, so I\u2019d want to see some serious\nexperimental confirmation it is viable.\u201d\n\nMusk loves to pontificate on what\u2019s possible in a future overrun by autonomous\nconnected vehicles. Things like a 24/7 robotaxi service in which your vehicle\nis out earning you passive income while you sleep sound awesome in theory. But\nwhen the rubber meets the road, Musk\u2019s big ideas tend to deflate.\n\n\u201cFor now it is an interesting idea,\u201d Koopman said, \u201cbut we need to keep in\nmind that most cool ideas like this do not pencil out to be practical.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Biden signs TikTok \u2018ban\u2019 bill into law, starting the clock for ByteDance to divest it\n\n  2. ## What happens after your country runs on 99 percent renewable electricity?\n\n  3. ## A morning with the Rabbit R1: a fun, funky, unfinished AI gadget\n\n  4. ## Framework won\u2019t be just a laptop company anymore\n\n  5. ## Steam will stop issuing refunds if you play two hours of a game before launch day\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Transpo\n\n  * ### Lamborghini\u2019s popular Urus SUV grows a plug \u2014 and goes hybrid\n\n  * ### The Mercedes G-Wagen, the ultimate off-road status symbol, goes electric\n\n  * ### A cheaper Tesla is back on the menu\n\n  * ### Tesla teases robotaxi ridehailing function in its app\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
