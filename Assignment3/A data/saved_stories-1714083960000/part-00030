As the software ecosystem has grown\nexponentially, the reality is that the proliferation of dependencies in modern\napplications has outstripped the capacity of human oversight.\n\nToday, developers often use libraries and dependencies without conducting\nthorough reviews of their codebases, implicitly trusting community vetting\nthat may not be as rigorous as needed. Let\u2019s face it, nobody is reading\nthrough all the code of every dependency in their projects, especially when\nthese frequently number in the thousands for complex applications.\n\nThis is where AI has the advantage with more and faster \u201ceyeballs\u201d than any\nhuman, capable of systematically analyzing massive dependency trees. With the\nhelp of AI, all bugs are not only shallow but also trivial to exploit.\n\nNowhere is this more starkly apparent than in recent news about researchers\nclaiming to have created a GPT-4 agent that can autonomously exploit both web\nand non-web vulnerabilities in real-world systems. Armed with the CVE\ndescription for 15 one-day vulnerabilities, GPT-4 was capable of exploiting\n87%, compared to 0% for GPT-3.5, other open-source LLMs, and widely used\nvulnerability scanners such as Zap and Metasploit.\n\nThe last vulnerability (ACIDRain) is an attack that was used to hack a\ncryptocurrency exchange for $50 million, which the researchers emulated in the\nWooCommerce framework.\n\nWithout the description, the researchers\u2019 GPT-4 agent could exploit only 7% of\nthe vulnerabilities. They estimated the cost of conducting successful\nautonomous AI exploits to be around $8.80 per exploit, a fraction of the cost\nof the average security researcher.\n\nEven if you think these findings are more indicative of AI\u2019s effective use as\nan intelligent scanner and crawler and not an emergent cyber security\ncapability, it\u2019s clear we are not too far from autonomous hacking. The\nwidespread deployment of LLM agents capable of these types of exploits will\nundoubtedly require AI-powered defenses.\n\n## Harnessing AI for Cybersecurity: The Imperative of AI-Driven Defense\nSystems#\n\nBusiness owners are becoming increasingly alert to the potential threats posed\nby AI. According to a new report published by Netacea, 93% of businesses\nbelieve that they will face daily AI attacks in the next year. The company\nsurveyed 440 businesses across the UK and US with $1.9bn average online\nrevenue across five sectors. AI-driven attacks are squarely on their radar,\nalthough adoption of AI-powered defenses is weighted more towards high-impact\nattack prevention.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cCyber Security in the Age of Offensive AI,\u201d found that 48%\nof CISOs expect to see AI-powered ransomware attacks, 38% believe that\nphishing attacks will be powered by AI, and 34% are concerned about AI-driven\nmalware attacks.\n\nThis survey found that 100% of businesses classified as enterprises have\nincorporated AI to some degree but smaller businesses often lack the funds and\nresources to implement the technology, despite understanding its significance:\n\n  * 65% of enterprises believe that offensive AI will become the norm\n  * 61% of security leaders stated that AI has reduced their operational overheads\n\nA 2023 report from the Office of National Statistics, which surveyed 10,000\nresponses from UK businesses (from small to large enterprises), found that 83%\nstated they have no plan to adopt AI as they head into 2024.\n\nBusinesses may not have the luxury to delay AI-adoption for very long. This\nnew landscape where AI can both find and exploit software bugs at scale\nintroduces a pressing challenge: while Linus's Law relied on human oversight,\nthe future of cybersecurity will depend increasingly on AI's ability to combat\nAI-driven threats.\n\n\u201cCurrent state of the art AI models can offer a significant advantage for\ndefenders in their ability to detect cyber attacks and generally improve the\nquality of code in a way that scales to the velocity of modern software\ndevelopment,\u201d security engineer Chris Rohlf said in his response to the\nresearch on autonomous exploits.\n\n\u201cPut simply the potential uplift provided by LLMs for defenders is orders of\nmagnitude larger than the uplift they provide attackers. This paper, like the\nlast one, reinforces my belief that there is still a gap between AI experts\nand cyber security experts. If we don't work on closing that gap then we will\nsquander the opportunity to utilize LLM's to their fullest potential for\nimproving the state of cyber security.\u201d\n\nAt Socket we are on the forefront of AI-powered threat detection for supply\nchain attacks, harnessing LLM\u2019s for early warnings on more than 100 attacks\nper week. Leveraging AI proactively for defense is the only way to stay ahead\nof the constant onslaught of malicious packages published to public registries\n- and many of these threat actors haven\u2019t even begun to upgrade their\noperations with AI-driven capabilities.\n\nThe key to humans keeping pace lies in maintaining a deep understanding of AI\ntechnologies and continuously adapting to new threats. Fear-mongering about\nAI\u2019s potential is not a productive response to these emerging capabilities. It\nleads to over-regulation, tipping the balance of power in favor of threat\nactors who will inevitably use it to exploit vulnerabilities and target\nmalicious packages in more sophisticated ways.\n\nIn his 1870 essay on Civilization, Ralph Waldo Emerson waxes eloquent on the\ndiscovery of electricity, and his exploration of mankind\u2019s relationship to\ntechnology is remarkably prescient of our journey with AI today:\n\n> Now that is the wisdom of a man, in every instance of his labor, to hitch\n> his wagon to a star,\u2019 and see his chore done by the gods themselves. That is\n> the way we are strong, by borrowing the might of the elements.\n\nThat era brought humanity inventions like the phonograph, telephone, and the\nincandescent light bulb, followed by the automobile in the next decade. Our\nchance to harness this moment in time for historic breakthroughs is just as\nsignficant. AI is now firmly embedded in story of human progress, and we\u2019re\njust getting started.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nGet notified when we publish new security blog posts!\n\n## Related posts\n\nBack to all posts\n\nSecurity News\n\n### UnitedHealth Group Discloses Protected Health Information Compromised for\n\u201cSubstantial Portion of People in America\u201d in Recent Cyberattack\n\nUnitedHealth Group disclosed that the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare\ncompromised protected health information for millions in the U.S., with\nestimated costs to the company expected to reach $1 billion.\n\nBy Sarah Gooding - Apr 24, 2024\n\nSecurity News\n\n### How Threat Actors are Abusing GitHub\u2019s File Upload Feature to Host Malware\n\nGitHub is susceptible to a CDN flaw that allows attackers to host malware on\nany public repository.\n\nBy Sarah Gooding - Apr 23, 2024\n\nSecurity News\n\n### The Dark Side of Open Source\n\nAt Node Congress, Socket CEO Feross Aboukhadijeh uncovers the darker aspects\nof open source, where applications that rely heavily on third-party\ndependencies can be exploited in supply chain attacks.\n\nBy Sarah Gooding - Apr 19, 2024\n\nProduct\n\n  * Package Alerts\n\n  * Integrations\n\n  * Docs\n\n  * Pricing\n\n  * FAQ\n\n  * Roadmap\n\nAbout\n\n  * About\n\n  * Love\n\n  * Blog\n\n  * Glossary\n\n  * Discord Community\n\n  * CareersHiring\n\n  * Send Feedback\n\n  * Contact Us\n\n  * System Status\n\nPackages\n\n  * npm Package Directory\n\n  * Explore npm Packages\n\n  * Go Package Directory\n\n  * Explore Go Packages\n\n  * Maven Package Directory\n\n  * Explore Maven Packages\n\n  * PyPi Package Directory\n\n  * Explore PyPi Packages\n\n  * Most Popular JS Packages\n\n  * Top JavaScript Maintainers\n\n  * Removed npm Packages\n\n  * Random npm Package\n\nStay in touch\n\nGet open source security insights delivered straight into your inbox.\n\n  * Terms\n  * Privacy\n  * Security\n\nMade with \u26a1\ufe0f by Socket Inc\n\n", "frontpage": false}
