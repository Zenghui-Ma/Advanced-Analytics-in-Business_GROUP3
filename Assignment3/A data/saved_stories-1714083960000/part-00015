Notably, the established COCO benchmark has propelled the\n> development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However, the COCO\n> segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last\n> decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing\n> instances, it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff\n> regions, which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic\n> segmentation annotations. These annotations, executed by different groups of\n> raters, have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in\n> inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study, we undertake a\n> comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By\n> enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K\n> images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks, we introduce COCONut, the COCO\n> Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation\n> annotations across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with\n> meticulously crafted high-quality masks, and establishes a robust benchmark\n> for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge, COCONut stands as the\n> inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset, verified by human\n> raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly\n> contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural\n> networks.\n\nComments:| Accepted at CVPR2024, data available at this https URL  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.08639 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.08639v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.08639arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Xueqing Deng [view email] [v1] Fri, 12 Apr 2024 17:59:40 UTC (18,366 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled COCONut: Modernizing COCO Segmentation, by\nXueqing Deng and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
