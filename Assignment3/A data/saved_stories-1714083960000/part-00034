Since AWS first debuted in 2006, we've reported\non the cloud giant\u2019s data center outages. Here\u2019s the timeline of events.\n\nData Center Knowledge | Apr 25, 2024\n\nSave\n\nAccording to InformationWeek\u2019s 2024 Cloud Computing Report, 60% of IT decision\nmakers use Amazon Web Services (AWS) and half of these respondents have faced\ndisruption due to an outage at AWS in the past 12 months.\n\nBut outages at AWS is nothing new. Since AWS first debuted to customers in\n2006, Data Center Knowledge has been keeping tabs on the cloud giant\u2019s data\ncenter outages and what they mean for the industry at large.\n\nRelated: What's Causing Cloud Outages? A Network Managers' Guide\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of the highlights:\n\n## September 29, 2007: Amazon EC2 Outage Wipes Out Data\n\nIn September 2007, AWS faced its first major outage, which wiped out some\ncustomer application data. Although Amazon\u2019s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was\nstill a \u201cbeta\u201d service at the time, users were less than enthusiastic about\nthe loss of data.\n\n## 2008: Major Outages for Amazon\u2019s S3 and EC2 Services\n\nRelated: AT&T Outage Shines A Spotlight On Network Dependability\n\nIn 2008, users of AWS saw significant outages in February and June. On\nFebruary 15, an outage disrupted sites using AWS to store images. On June 5,\nsevere weather conditions\n\nbriefly took out power in an undisclosed AWS data center.\n\n## 2009: AWS Outages in June, July, and December\n\nIn 2009, AWS was hit by three major outages, beginning with a June 10\nlightning strike taking out service for the EC2 cloud computing service. On\nJuly 19, the cloud service provider suffered a two-hour outage, resulting in\nAmazon.com becoming inaccessible for users. Finally, on December 10, AWS faced\na third outage due to power problems in a northern Virginia data center.\n\n## 2010: Weekend Hardware Failures Cause AWS Outages\n\nAWS encountered a series of power outages and hardware failures in 2010 that\nresulted in a loss of service for its customers on multiple occasions. EC2\nexperienced two power outages on May 4 and a seven-hour power loss in the US-\nEast zone on Saturday, May 8. In each case, a group of users in a single\navailability zone lost service, while the majority of EC2 users remained\nunaffected. Then, on December 12, EC2 services in Amazon\u2019s EU-West region\nexperienced performance problems for about two hours, causing downtime for\nsome of Amazon's European sites. Amazon refuted claims of electronic attacks,\nblaming the outage on the failure of several network hardware devices.\n\n## 2011: AWS Outage Takes Out Reddit, Quora\n\nOn April 21, 2011, AWS suffered an extended outage in one of its northern\nVirginia data centers, which took down popular sites including Reddit and\nQuora. Later that year, in August, AWS also faced outages in a Dublin data\ncenter, and offered a 10-day service credit for all those affected.\n\n## 2012: Bugs, Generator Failures, and a Christmas Eve Outage\n\n2012 saw a number of major AWS outages, including:\n\n  * On March 15, Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service went down in US-East 1.\n  * In mid-June, on the 14th, a set of failures in a northern Virginia data center led to over an hour of downtime.\n  * Later in June, on the 29th, more generator failures led to downtime for both Netflix and Instagram.\n  * On October 22, a software bug and further cascading failures resulted in a service outage for services running AWS.\n  * Finally, on Christmas Eve, AWS suffered a significant 20-hour outage that ran into Christmas Day.\n\n## 2013: Autumnal Outages\n\nIn 2013, AWS suffered two major outages. First on August 19, AWS suffered a\n45-minute outage that resulted in downtime for Amazon\u2019s flagship Amazon.com\nretail sites. Then, on September 13, AWS services in the US-East 1 region\nsuffered a near two-hour outage.\n\n## September 20, 2015: Amazon\u2019s DynamoDB Outage\n\nIn September 2015, AWS\u2019s US-East region experienced a brief network disruption\nimpacting its NoSQL database service, DynamoDB. As a result, some of the\ninternet\u2019s biggest sites and cloud services were made unavailable.\n\n## June 5, 2016: Sydney AWS Cloud Outage\n\nBad weather knocked out AWS services in Sydney, Australia, in June 2016. AWS\nsaid a significant number of EC2 instances and EBS volumes within its Sydney\nregion were impacted by connectivity issues.\n\n## February 28, 2017: AWS Outage that Broke the Internet Caused by Mistyped\nCommand\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars were lost as the result of an AWS outage in\nFebruary 2017. According to Amazon, the disruption was caused by a mistyped\ncommand during a routine debugging exercise. The outage lasted several hours\nand affected various AWS customers, including Coursera, Medium, Quora, Slack,\nDocker, Expedia, and AWS\u2019s own cloud health status dashboard.\n\n## March 2, 2018: Equinix Power Outage Behind AWS Cloud Disruption\n\nIn March 2018, a power outage at the Equinix data center was blamed for\nconnectivity problems that temporarily silenced Amazon\u2019s smart assistant Alexa\nand disrupted operations for some AWS customers, including Atlassian, Twilio,\nand Capital One.\n\n## November 4, 2020: AWS Outage Hits Roku, Adobe\n\nAWS suffered an outage in November 2020 that impacted some enterprise\ncustomers, including Roku, Adobe, and Flickr. AWS\u2019 service page noted that its\nKinesis data streaming service was \u201cimpaired\u201d in its US East 1 region.\n\n## December 5, 2022: AWS Outage in US-East 2 Availability Zone\n\nIn December 2022, a 40-minute outage hit AWS\u2019s US-East 2 region, the second\noutage for the zone in 2022. AWS published no incident summary for this\noutage, and a spokesperson told Data Center Knowledge the company does \u201cnot\npublish Post-Event Summaries ... for every service event.\u201d\n\n## June 13, 2023: Amazon's Cloud Computing Service Experiences Regional Outage\n\nRecently, in June 2023, AWS experienced a wide-reaching outage, affecting many\nlarge organizations, including The Boston Globe, the New York Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority, and the Associated Press.\n\nTAGS: Amazon\n\n0 comments\n\nHide comments\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nData Center News Roundup: Updates From DCW, 911 Outage, New Builds\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\nTSMC Resumes Operations Day After Deadly Quake\n\nApr 04, 2024\n\nOutage Alert: Weather Service Warning Systems Fail During Severe Storm\nOutbreak\n\nApr 03, 2024\n\nIn-Sync: The Crucial Role of Timing in Data Centers\n\nApr 03, 2024\n\n  * Load More\n  * Next Article\n\n  * About Us\n  * Contact Us\n  * Advertise\n  * Sitemap\n  * Ad Choices\n\n  * CCPA: Do not sell my personal info\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Content Licensing/Reprints\n  * Cookie Policy\n\nFollow us:\n\n\u00a9 2024 Informa USA, Inc., All rights reserved\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n\nSubscribe to Receive Data Center Knowledge Straight to your your inbox.\n\nI am a Data Center Professsional - I want to subscribeI\nproduce/distribute/finance data centers - I want to subscribe\ud83d\udcd6 Not interested.\nLet me read on\n\n## Welcome\n\n# This site asks for consent to use your data\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 62 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
