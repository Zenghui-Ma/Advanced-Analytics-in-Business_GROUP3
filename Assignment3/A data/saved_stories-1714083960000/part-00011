Occasional notetaking turned into a systematic search, and I believe this\nlist is close to complete. To the best of my knowledge I am the first to\ncompile much of this information -- but perhaps others have done so, somewhere\nbeyond the reach of my search-fu.\n\nDuring this investigation, I was specifically concerned with syllables which\nare rare regardless of which tone they are pronounced in. This meant that even\ncertain uncommon tone-syllable pairings were not rare enough for me; for\ninstance, only two characters are pronounced qiong in fourth tone, but qiong\nwas not eligible for my list because there are many other characters\npronounced qiong across the other three tones.\n\nIf you know a thing or two about Chinese, I urge you to read the disclaimer\nand leave comments, especially if you spot an error. \"The best way to learn\nsomething is to be wrong about it on the Internet.\"\n\n## Zero Characters?\n\n## One Character\n\nEight syllables are associated with a single character.\n\n### Unique Syllables in Everyday Use\n\nThree of the eight are everyday words\n\n^2 in heavy use. Shei is by far the most well-known of these: the only word\npronounced shei is the question word \"who.\" The word \"who\" is as common in\nMandarin as it is in English, yet you'll never hear that syllable anywhere\nelse.\n\nThe next everyday syllable with just one character is lia. Its one and only\nwritten counterpart is \u4fe9 \"two, both\", a colloquial shortening of \u4e24\u4e2a \"two MW\n\n^3.\" They can be used interchangeably in phrases like \"you two\" (\u201c\u4f60\u4eec\u4fe9/\u4f60\u4eec\u4e24\u4e2a\u201d).\n\nFinally, there is gei, which in third tone is the verb \u7ed9 \"to give,\" as well\nas, roughly speaking, an indirect object marker and a passive marker.\n\nMDBG claims that \u5047 is pronounced gei to transcribe a single word of Hokkien. I\noriginally took this to mean that gei should be in the two-syllable category,\nbut on 2020-11-10 I reconsidered, and moved it here. A single Hokkien\ntranscription is far from a central example for Standard Mandarin usage, with\nwhich this essay is concerned. My MacOS input suggests that \u488e is also\npronounced gei, but as this character is so rare that even Zdic doesn't list a\npronunciation, I'm willing to discard it for the time being. Eventually I will\ncheck elsewhere.\n\n[Boy, I wish I didn't have to keep manually checking dictionary sites. If only\nsomeone was building a web interface to check all the important dictionaries\nat once, as part of a Chinese information-management tool.]\n\n### Unique Syllables, Rarely Seen\n\nThe remaining syllables in the single-character group are associated with\ncharacters far less common than the characters for shei, lia, and gei.\n\nThe character \u6b3b can be pronounced chua, first tone, to mean \"crashing sound,\"\nwhile tei is an alternate reading for \u5fd2 \"too, very\" (also pronounced tui,\nwhich is anything but rare.)\n\nRather more obscure is fiao\n\n^4, which as \u8985 which means something like \"need not\" or \"don't.\" Also obscure\nis kei, found only as an alternate reading for \u514b, meaning \"scold.\" That\ncharacter, \u514b, is quite common, especially in adaptations or transcriptions of\nforeign words, but it is practically always read ke4. Had I not undertaken\nthis project, I might never have encountered the kei reading, even if another\neight years of study went by.\n\nLastly, eng is unambiguously associated with just one character: \u97a5, an archaic\nliterary term for a horse's reins. Technically, eng is considered a\npronunciation for the interjection \u55ef, \"ah/oh/hmm?\", but that is more often\npronounced en\n\n^5. Furthermore, \"en\" and \"eng\" are not distinguished by many speakers of\nChinese, so the case for admitting this as a second character pronounced eng\nis weak, at best.\n\n### A Very Special Edge Case\n\nA ninth syllable technically does not belong to this category, but might be\nconsidered a special case. The syllable fo, in second tone, is associated only\nwith \u4f5b \"Buddha.\" There are other characters with this pronunciation, but all\nof them are variants having exactly the same meaning. By contrast, the\ncharacters for the other rare syllables listed here all have distinct\netymologies. As I understand it, no other characters have acquired the\npronunciation fo because of the combined seriousness of Buddhist religious\nconviction and traditional Chinese naming taboos.\n\n## Two Characters\n\nFour syllables are only encountered as readings for two piddly characters.\n\n  * diu is the reading for \u4e22 diu1 \"lose, discard\" and \u94e5 diu1 \"thulium\". (I choose to ignore a variant on the former which uses a heng stroke instead of a pie at the top, i.e. \u4e1f; I also choose to leave out the character \u98a9, which, according to Zdic, is only ever read diu1 when it stands in for \u4e22.)\n  * sen is bestowed on these and these alone: \u68ee sen1 \"forest\" and \u692e sen1 \"lush growth (of trees); fishing using bundled wood.\"\n  * seng cuddles up to just two characters: \u50e7 seng1 \"monk; sangha\" and \u9b19 seng1 \"short hair; unkempt.\"\n  * zen is the pronunciation for only two characters: \u600e zen3, the ultra-common interrogative \"why?/how?\", and \u8c2e zen4, a literary term meaning \"(to) slander.\" MacOS pinyin input, as usual, has some extra ultra-obscure and potentially wrong suggestions: \u648d, which Pleco says is usually pronounced zan4 but may also be pronounced zen1; \u3ef8; \u56ce, which is \u8d60 \"give gift\" supplemented by a mouth radical; and \u4ac8. None of these show up regularly in dictionaries. (Thanks to Jacob Reed for bringing zen to my attention on 2021-12-09.)\n\n## Three Characters\n\nThere are eight syllables which are associated with three characters.\n\n  * miu is attached to \u8c2c, \u7f2a, and \u5512 -- and I've only found dictionary entries for the first two. The word \u8352\u8c2c huang1miu4 \"absurd, ridiculous\" is the most commonly-seen word containing one of those characters.\n  * zei has \u8d3c \"thief, traitors; wily, deceitful; extremely\" and a variant thereon, \u621d (ignoring the difference between simplified and traditional versions of the \u8d1d radical), as well as \u9c97 \"cuttlefish.\"\n  * cen has \u37e5 \"uneven, not uniform,\" \u5c91 \"small hill\" (also a surname), and \u6d94 \"overflow; rainwater; tearful.\"\n  * fou has \u5426 \"negate, deny\"; \u7d11 \"bright; glossy\"; and \u7f36 \"pottery.\" The first, fou3 \"negate, deny,\" is common in formal language; the others are quite specific and rarely seen.\n  * shua is most commonly encountered as the reading for \u5237, as shua1 \"to brush, daub, paint\" or shua4 \"to select.\" The other characters for this syllable are \u800d \"play with; wield; act cool; display (skill, temper)\" and \u5530, a piece of onomatopoeia for a whistling or rustling sound.\n  * One of the characters read ne is the extremely common speech particle \u5462. It can occur at the ends of questions in certain discourse contexts, and can also be said in between listed items. The other two characters, both pronounced ne4 are \u8bb7 \"speak slowly; inarticulate\" and the radical \u7592 \"sick, sickness\". I've never heard this last one referred to as ne4, which is its name as a Kangxi radical; in everyday speech, it is called \u75c5\u5b57\u65c1, \"the radical in \u75c5\" (which also means \"sick, disease\").\n  * den is oddly distinguished by its three characters \u627d, \u6265, and \u3a50, all of which are read den4 and have the meaning \"yank, pull tight.\"\n  * n\u00fce has to its credit \u8650 \"oppressive, tyrannical\" and \u759f \"malaria.\" MacOS pinyin input claims that \u7878 is one, too, but it's not in any of the dictionaries I've checked so far.\n\n## Honorable Mentions: Four Characters\n\nThe honorable mentions have four characters each. Zhua and shuan are\ndefinitely in this group, while a few other candidates need more detailed\nchecking: shai seems like it has either 4 or 5, while ha and re are up in the\nair.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI am confident that this piece is unfinished. Even as I typed up this essay\nfrom my notes, I continued to find obscure characters which forced me to\nshuffle the above list.\n\nI understand the obstacles to definitively stating that such and such syllable\nhas exactly so many characters. Old, archaic, and variant characters make that\nquest questionable, as do the differences between simplified and traditional\ncharacters\n\n^6. I have, however, succeeded in ruling out the rarity of most Mandarin\nsyllables; observing what is left -- even when exact numbers are hard to come\nby -- is enough to make this linguist happy.\n\nI started many of my searches for this project by typing a toneless syllable\ninto the MacOS pinyin input method and seeing how many characters it\nsuggested. That was a sufficiently reliable indicator to show whether I should\nsearch dictionaries such as CC-CEDICT, Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian, and the\nPleco app's in-house dictionary. If there is any large, reliable character\ndatabase which allows a syllable as a search keyword, I have not found it.\n\n  1. Modern Standard Mandarin (MSM) is the official version of Mandarin on the Chinese mainland, natively called Putonghua \u666e\u901a\u8bdd or \"common speech.\" The Taiwanese standard is usually called Taiwanese Mandarin (\u56fd\u8bed \"national language.\")\u21a9\n\n  2. These three characters can stand alone as words, but many characters cannot.\u21a9\n\n  3. \"MW\" means \"measure word,\" also called a \"classifier.\" Roughly speaking, a measure word is an extra element which is usually^7 pronounced between a number and the noun that number counts. English does not have measure words, but it does have something similar in the way \"cup\" is used in \"three cups of milk\" (which is sometimes called a \"massifier^8.\") In Chinese, you add something like \"cup\" on any noun you count. In English, we could say \"two cows\" or \"two head of cattle,\" but in Chinese that would always be rendered as \"two head of cattle.\" And in English, there's no word like \"head\" for snakes or cats, but wiggly things like snakes (and pants, and rivers) share a measure word, as do small animals like cats, birds, and dogs.\u21a9\n\n  4. Thanks to \"Unusual Syllables,\" at East Asia Student.\u21a9\n\n  5. In one of several tones, depending on the speaker's meaning.\u21a9\n\n  6. In all the cases I recall investigating for this essay, there was a 1-to-1 relationship between simplified and traditional characters, such that the count was the same whether I considered the traditional or the simplified character as canonical. I predict that any further large changes to my list will come from correcting mistakes made at this phase (e.g. noticing cases where two totally different traditional characters were simplified to one form, in which case my count was N but should be N+1.)\u21a9\n\n", "frontpage": false}
