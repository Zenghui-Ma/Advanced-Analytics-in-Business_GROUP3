On sunny days, there's\nnow so much solar energy being supplied that electricity prices can dip into\nthe negative, The Washington Post reports \u2014 a preview of the economic and\ninfrastructural problems that renewables will have to navigate.\n\n\"These are not insurmountable challenges,\" Michelle Davis at consulting firm\nWood Mackenzie Power and Renewables, told the WaPo. \"But they are challenges\nthat a lot of grid operators have never had to deal with.\"\n\n## Ray Lotta\n\nSolar power, unlike energy from fossil fuels, isn't \"dispatchable,\" meaning\nthat electricity grid operators can't control \u2014 or even necessarily predict \u2014\nhow much energy it supplies.\n\nThis comes into play in what's called \"net load\": the total demand for\nelectricity minus the energy supplied by solar and other renewables. What's\nleft over in that equation is the amount of power from conventional sources\nthat CAISO, California's grid operator, will have to put into the electric\nsystem.\n\nIn the morning when everyone's getting up, demand is high. But by midday, the\nsun's out and solar energy can provide almost all the power needed, causing\nprices to plummet.\n\nOn a graph of daily net load, this pronounced pattern is called a \"duck\ncurve,\" for its resemblance to the bird. It's at its most dramatic in the\nspring, when the skies are sunny but temperatures are relatively mild, meaning\nthat there's less demand for heating and cooling.\n\n\"We drastically underestimated the speed at which residential solar was going\nto come in,\" Clyde Loutan, principal for renewable energy integration at\nCAISO, told the WaPo.\n\n## Fine Shine\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, it's a good problem to have. Solar energy is\nobviously no slouch.\n\nBut it also means that a lot of that energy isn't being used. According to the\nWaPo, 95 percent of California's 2.4 million megawatt-hours of wasted\nelectricity in 2022 was solar. The chief consequence of that waste, the WaPo\nargues, is economic. In the long run, it could cause electricity prices to go\nup.\n\nCalifornia has responded to this predicament in a way that has angered\nproponents of renewables. Last year, the state government started paying solar\nowners less money for the energy they put into the grid, a practice known as\n\"net-metering.\" In effect, this makes solar less affordable, curtailing its\nadoption.\n\nDiscouraging as that may be, there are other promising solutions to explore.\nRight now, according to the WaPo, CAISO is selling some of that extra power to\nnearby states.\n\nThe real game changer would be if, in the future, the widespread use of\nbatteries and other forms of storage could save any excess solar power\ngenerated during the day \u2014 meaning the power from sunny days will be able to\nlast well into the nighttime, instead of forcing fossil fuel power plants to\nspin back up.\n\nMore on solar: Researchers Say Solar Is Getting So Good That People Could\nStart Quitting the Electric Grid\n\nShare This Article\n\nThe Best Marine Solar Panels of 2024\n\nUpdated 9.7.23, 4:38 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nSolar Slay\n\nSolar Powered Machine Turns CO2 and Waste Plastic Into Valuable Fuel\n\n1.12.23, 3:48 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\nGood Neighbors\n\nGerman Government Says It May Keep Nuclear Plant Open After All\n\n7.31.22, 9:30 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nUnreliable Friends\n\nArchipelagic Nation Sick of Other Countries Breaking Climate Change Promises\n\n5.29.22, 5:13 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
