In fact, it\u2019s not uncommon for SaaS businesses to have customers\nall over the world. The expansion opportunities SaaS businesses have access to\nare unmatched; however, selling globally does draw in other considerations,\nlike value-added tax (VAT).\n\nThe penalties for non-compliance with VAT can be severe, which is why it\u2019s\nimportant to take a proactive approach to registration and report tracking.\nEven if you outsource the filing of VAT to your accountant or bookkeeper, you\nare still required to complete backend work to gather information surrounding\nsales.\n\nSubscribe to our fortnightly newsletter written by experts in Finance, Law,\nand Tech.\n\nSubscribe to our fortnightly newsletter written by experts in Finance, Law,\nand Tech.\n\nSubscribe to our fortnightly newsletter written by experts in Finance, Law,\nand Tech.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll cover everything your SaaS business needs to know about\nVAT report preparation. After you\u2019ve finished reading this article, you\u2019ll\nknow the ins and outs of what your team needs to do to maintain compliance\nwith VAT regulators and how to stay on your accountant\u2019s good side.\n\n##\n\nWhat is Value-Added Tax?\n\nBefore we dive into how to prepare VAT reports for your accountant, we must\nfirst understand the basics of VAT. Value-added tax is a consumption tax\ncharged on goods and services in each step of the supply chain where value has\nbeen added. Common items this tax applies to include labor, interest payments,\nmaterials, and profits.\n\nEach country can adjust the VAT rate imposed based on its fundraising needs.\nFor example, the United Kingdom has a VAT rate of 20%, while Ireland has a\nrate of 23%. US-based businesses might be able to qualify for a unified VAT\nrate to simplify the process. Working with a qualified accountant is the best\nway to see if this situation applies to your SaaS business.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to differentiate between the Goods and Services Tax, known\nas GST. GST is also assessed at each stage of the supply chain; however, this\ntax is imposed regardless of if value has been added to the product.\n\n##\n\nB2B vs B2C Sale\n\nVAT is generally paid by the consumer who purchases the product. VAT can seem\nlike double taxation since it\u2019s imposed on both consumers and business owners,\nbut this isn\u2019t the case, as the tax is incremental. For one, VAT is calculated\nbased on the location of the customer and if the transaction is B2B or B2C.\n\nB2C sales are generally subject to VAT, while B2B transactions might be\nsubject to a reverse charge, where the business you are selling to pays their\nown government the VAT. With B2B transactions, it\u2019s important to request a VAT\nidentification number from each business or customer to verify that a reverse\ncharge will occur.\n\nReverse charges are normally reserved for physical items, not digital items.\nAny businesses that don\u2019t have a VAT identification number will be treated as\na B2C sale for threshold purposes. Businesses with a VAT identification number\nare charged a 0% tax rate if it\u2019s a reverse charge.\n\nMoreover, the registration thresholds can differ based on your primary\ncustomer base. For example, the European Union requires VAT registration after\nyour first B2C sale. As your target market changes, it\u2019s important to revisit\nyour VAT compliance.\n\n##\n\nWho is Subject to VAT?\n\nSince SaaS businesses primarily sell digital goods, it can be difficult to\nknow exactly how VAT is calculated. The rules of each country outside of the\nEuropean Union can vary. Nevertheless, most countries have determined that\ndigital products do qualify for VAT. The European Union has established four\ncriteria used to determine if a product is a digital good:\n\n  1. The product is not tangible.\n\n  2. The product offering is based on IT.\n\n  3. The product is offered through the internet or other electronic network.\n\n  4. The product involves minimal human intervention.\n\nOnline games, images, downloadable software, site hosting services, and SaaS\nare all considered digital goods and subject to VAT regulations. If your\nproduct doesn\u2019t meet the above criteria, it may be considered a physical item.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that every transaction and country you sell your products to\nwill be subject to VAT. Many countries have VAT thresholds, which are sales\namounts that must be exceeded before you are required to collect and remit\nVAT. These thresholds vary by country, making it important to work closely\nwith an expert to monitor sales activity.\n\n##\n\nToday\u2019s Post Sponsor\n\nBillaBear is a free-to-use Subscription Management and Billing System is self-\nhosted.

VAT is very similar to sales tax in the US. As a result,\nmany more countries are adopting provisions to tax products in the digital\nrealm, not always requiring significant value to be added to the product.\n\nThe primary test that SaaS business owners and managers will need to complete\nto determine VAT is the location of customers. Where are your products being\nsold to? This information should be readily available from the point-of-sale\ninformation. If you have customers located in the European Union or other\ncountries that impose VAT, you may need to register and file forms.\n\n##\n\nThe VAT Registration Process\n\nBefore you can start collecting VAT, you need to go through the proper\nregistration processes. This includes obtaining a VAT number and registering\nyour company with each country. However, countries in the European Union are\nconsidered \u201cone\u201d entity for VAT. You can choose which of these countries you\nregister in, and your VAT number will be applicable to all other countries.\nWhen you register for the EU\u2019s One-Stop-Shop, you can file and pay all of your\nVAT obligations in one country, even if the sales are sourced elsewhere in the\nEU. This makes the entire process simpler.\n\nFor countries that aren\u2019t a part of the European Union, you may have to go\nthrough a separate registration process. Moreover, some countries may\nautomatically assign your business a number, while others will only give you a\nnumber after you\u2019ve completed the registration process. When your business is\nassigned a number, be sure that it\u2019s a VAT number and not a local number. You\nmay need to complete an extra registration step to receive a VAT number.\n\nGoing through the registration process in each jurisdiction can be tedious and\nopen the door to a high level of errors, especially for SaaS businesses. This\nis why many companies work with a qualified accountant or bookkeeper to\nfacilitate the registration process. VAT does draw in legal complexities, as\nyou cannot legally collect VAT from customers without a formal application in\nplace with the jurisdiction.\n\nTo maintain compliance, your SaaS business needs to properly track sales to\neach country to know when thresholds are triggered, which we\u2019ll discuss in\nmore detail in the next section. For now, let\u2019s assume that you are nearing\nthe threshold. What information does your accountant need for the registration\nprocess? Although the process will look slightly different for each country,\nexpect to furnish the following information:\n\n  * Company registration number.\n\n  * Business bank account numbers for security deposit.\n\n  * Certificate of incorporation or organization.\n\n  * Proof of taxable transactions.\n\n  * Power of attorney to act as a fiscal representative.\n\n  * VAT certificate in your home country.\n\n  * Proof of signature.\n\nIf you need to apply for VAT, start compiling these documents for your\naccountant. The approval process can take a few weeks, so it\u2019s best to be\nprepared to maintain compliance with withholding and remittances.\n\n##\n\n4 Steps to Prepare VAT Reports for Bookkeepers and Accountants\n\nPassing the burden of VAT filing off to an accountant or bookkeeper doesn\u2019t\nmean you don\u2019t have any responsibilities. In fact, you play a crucial role in\nthe accuracy of your VAT filings with your internal records. You will need to\nfurnish a variety of reports to your accounting professional before they can\nsubmit your quarterly VAT. Here are four steps to implement to ensure a smooth\nVAT filing process for both you and your accountant:\n\n###\n\nStep #1: Compile a List of Current VAT Filing Requirements\n\nFirst, you want to compile a list of your current VAT filings. If your SaaS\nbusiness has already been collecting VAT from customers, make a list of the\njurisdiction you are reporting in. If you\u2019re just tackling the VAT process for\nthe first time, you won\u2019t have an existing list of filing obligations. This is\nwhere your sales by location will come into play.\n\nWithin your accounting system, pull a sales by location report. This report\nshould contain the following columns: gross sales sourced to each country for\nthe defined time period. If the different countries are not populating, you\nmay need to consider adding a different revenue collection software program\nthat shows the address of each customer. When looking into prospective\nsoftware programs, be sure that the software can easily integrate with your\nmain accounting system. Here are some tips when pulling your sales report:\n\n  * Be sure the report breaks down sales by both country and locality.\n\n  * Ensure the proper cut-off date for transactions.\n\n  * Differentiate sales by product. (Some products might be nontaxable).\n\nConfirming that the sales report you send your accountant has these three\ncomponents can help avoid confusion and streamline your VAT reporting. Your\naccountant or bookkeeper might request a certain file type, like excel or pdf.\nDouble check on the preferred format.\n\n###\n\nStep #2: Break Down Sales by Country with Supporting Invoices\n\nThe next step in your report preparation process is to break down sales by\ncountry. Using your report from the previous step, make a list of the total\ntaxable sales to each country. Remember, the reverse charge rules. If a\nbusiness customer makes a declaration of VAT on the purchased item, you are\nnot required to collect VAT. This commonly applies if a customer is purchasing\nyour software to improve their own product or service.\n\nIf you think a reverse charge might be applicable, you must have the VAT\nnumber of the customer on file. If not, you will be required to charge VAT.\nTaking your sales report, make a list of the vendors or businesses that have a\nVAT number. This helps your accountant double check that the revenue should\nnot be included in your VAT filing.\n\nWith the sales report and the VAT number of businesses, your accountant can\nidentify which countries may need to be added to the VAT filing list based on\ntransaction and revenue thresholds. Being as accurate as possible when pulling\nreports maximizes your compliance.\n\nAt a minimum, your sales by country report should include the following\ncolumns: each sales transaction, the country it was purchased from, the date\nof the sale, and the total amount. Since this report can contain a lot of\ninformation, double check the format your accountant or bookkeeper prefers.\nData is usually easier to manipulate in an excel or CSV file type.\n\n###\n\nStep #3: Outline VAT Collected from Customers\n\nIn the third step of the VAT report preparation process, you will want to\noutline how much VAT you have collected from customers. VAT income is\ncollected from customers at the point-of-sale; however, it may show up in your\naccounting system as general revenue. If you haven\u2019t already, break out the\nVAT income from your gross revenue. You don\u2019t want to be double taxed. This\nreport should contain the following columns: date of sale, sale amount, tax\ncollected from customer, estimated tax due, and the location of the customer.\nExcel will most likely be the preferred format for this report, but confirm\nwith your accounting professional.\n\nYour accountant or bookkeeper will also use this information when preparing\nyour VAT returns to double check that your sales controls are working\nproperly. For example, if you only collected 15% of VAT from UK customers,\nwhen the actual rate is 20%, you might need to rework your internal controls\nto avoid paying out of pocket.\n\nThe VAT collected by your SaaS business should result in a net zero liability.\nThis means that the amount remitted with your VAT return should match what was\nactually collected from customers. Keep in mind, SaaS businesses are commonly\ncharged VAT at the endpoint of the sale, but not always. If you purchase raw\nmaterials or improve your product leading up to the sale, you might have other\nVAT obligations.\n\n###\n\nStep #4: Provide Reports to Accountants Before Deadline\n\nFinally, submit all of the information you\u2019ve compiled in the previous three\nsteps to your accountant or bookkeeper. Every country outside of the European\nUnion will have different filing requirements, like Japan with an annual\nfiling requirement or South Africa with bi-monthly reporting. Nevertheless,\nexpect to have your accountant file VAT returns on a quarterly basis. This\nmeans they will need access to all of the relevant reports before the\ndeadline. Here are the due dates for European Union VAT:\n\n  * First Quarter (January 1 \u2013 March 31) \u2013 April 20^th\n\n  * Second Quarter (April 1 \u2013 June 30) \u2013 July 20^th\n\n  * Third Quarter (July 1 \u2013 September 30) \u2013 October 20^th\n\n  * Fourth Quarter (October 1 \u2013 December 31) \u2013 January 20^th\n\nKeeping track of your filing obligations is crucial. If you are nearing a\nthreshold in a certain country, alert your accountant well before the due date\nso they have time to go through the registration process on your behalf.\n\n##\n\nSummary\n\nDespite what you might have believed, SaaS businesses can be subject to VAT.\nWhen it comes to maintaining compliance with VAT, having an experienced\naccountant on your side is crucial.
