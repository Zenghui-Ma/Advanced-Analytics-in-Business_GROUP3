It is my\nopinion that many of these never-ending crises are sparked off by an\nassortment of pernicious social fallacies \u2014 ideas about human interaction\nwhich spur their holders to do terrible and stupid things to themselves and to\neach other.\n\nSocial fallacies are particularly insidious because they tend to be\nexaggerated versions of notions that are themselves entirely reasonable and\nunobjectionable. It\u2019s difficult to debunk the pathological fallacy without\nseeming to argue against its reasonable form; therefore, once it establishes\nitself, a social fallacy is extremely difficult to dislodge. It\u2019s my hope that\ndrawing attention to some of them may be a step in the right direction.\n\nI want to note that I\u2019m not trying to say that every geek subscribes to every\none of the fallacies I outline here; every individual subscribes to a\ndifferent set of ideas, and adheres to any given idea with a different amount\nof zeal.\n\nIn any event, here are five geek social fallacies I\u2019ve identified. There are\nlikely more.\n\n### Geek Social Fallacy #1: Ostracizers Are Evil\n\nGSF1 is one of the most common fallacies, and one of the most deeply held.\nMany geeks have had horrible, humiliating, and formative experiences with\nostracism, and the notion of being on the other side of the transaction is\nrepugnant to them.\n\nIn its non-pathological form, GSF1 is benign, and even commendable: it is long\npast time we all grew up and stopped with the junior high popularity games.\nHowever, in its pathological form, GSF1 prevents its carrier from\nparticipating in \u2014 or tolerating \u2014 the exclusion of anyone from anything, be\nit a party, a comic book store, or a web forum, and no matter how obnoxious,\noffensive, or aromatic the prospective excludee may be.\n\nAs a result, nearly every geek social group of significant size has at least\none member that 80% of the members hate, and the remaining 20% merely\ntolerate. If GSF1 exists in sufficient concentration \u2014 and it usually does \u2014\nit is impossible to expel a person who actively detracts from every social\nevent. GSF1 protocol permits you not to invite someone you don\u2019t like to a\ngiven event, but if someone spills the beans and our hypothetical Cat Piss Man\ninvites himself, there is no recourse. You must put up with him, or you will\nbe an Evil Ostracizer and might as well go out for the football team.\n\nThis phenomenon has a number of unpleasant consequences. For one thing, it\nactively hinders the wider acceptance of geek-related activities: I don\u2019t know\nthat RPGs and comics would be more popular if there were fewer trolls who\nsmell of cheese hassling the new blood, but I\u2019m sure it couldn\u2019t hurt. For\nanother, when nothing smacking of social selectiveness can be discussed in\npublic, people inevitably begin to organize activities in secret. These\nconspiracies often lead to more problems down the line, and the end result is\nas juvenile as anything a seventh-grader ever dreamed of.\n\n### Geek Social Fallacy #2: Friends Accept Me As I Am\n\nThe origins of GSF2 are closely allied to the origins of GSF1. After being\nvictimized by social exclusion, many geeks experience their \u201ctribe\u201d as a non-\njudgmental haven where they can take refuge from the cruel world outside.\n\nThis seems straightforward and reasonable. It\u2019s important for people to have a\nspace where they feel safe and accepted. Ideally, everyone\u2019s social group\nwould be a safe haven. When people who rely too heavily upon that refuge feel\ninsecure in that haven, however, a commendable ideal mutates into its\npathological form, GSF2.\n\nCarriers of GSF2 believe that since a friend accepts them as they are, anyone\nwho criticizes them is not their friend. Thus, they can\u2019t take criticism from\nfriends \u2014 criticism is experienced as a treacherous betrayal of the\nfriendship, no matter how inappropriate the criticized behavior may be.\n\nConversely, most carriers will never criticize a friend under any\ncircumstances; the duty to be supportive trumps any impulse to point out\nunacceptable behavior.\n\nGSF2 has extensive consequences within a group. Its presence in substantial\nquantity within a social group vastly increases the group\u2019s conflict-\naverseness. People spend hours debating how to deal with conflicts, because\nthey know (or sometimes merely fear) that the other person involved is a GSF2\ncarrier, and any attempt to confront them directly will only make things\nworse. As a result, people let grudges brew much longer than is healthy, and\nthey spend absurd amounts of time deconstructing their interpersonal dramas in\nsearch of a back way out of a dilemma.\n\nIronically, GSF2 carriers often take criticism from coworkers, supervisors,\nand mentors quite well; those individuals aren\u2019t friends, and aren\u2019t expected\nto accept the carrier unconditionally.\n\n### Geek Social Fallacy #3: Friendship Before All\n\nValuing friendships is a fine and worthy thing. When taken to an unhealthy\nextreme, however, GSF3 can manifest itself.\n\nLike GSF2, GSF3 is a \u201cfriendship test\u201d fallacy: in this case, the carrier\nbelieves that any failure by a friend to put the interests of the friendship\nabove all else means that they aren\u2019t really a friend at all. It should be\nobvious that there are a million ways that this can be a problem for the\ncarrier\u2019s friends, but the most common one is a situation where friends\u2019\ninterests conflict \u2014 if, for example, one friend asks you to keep a secret\nfrom another friend. If both friends are GSF3 carriers, you\u2019re screwed \u2014 the\nfirst one will feel betrayed if you reveal the secret, and the other will feel\nbetrayed if you don\u2019t. Your only hope is to keep the second friend from\nfinding out, which is difficult if the secret in question was a party that a\nlot of people went to.\n\nGSF3 can be costly for the carrier as well. They often sacrifice work, family,\nand romantic obligations at the altar of friendship. In the end, the carrier\nhas a great circle of friends, but not a lot else to show for their life. This\nis one reason why so many geek circles include people whose sole redeeming\nquality is loyalty: it\u2019s hard not to honor someone who goes to such lengths to\nbe there for a friend, however destructive they may be in other respects.\n\nIndividual carriers sometimes have exceptions to GSF3, which allow friends to\nplace a certain protected class of people or things above friendship in a\npinch: \u201csignificant others\u201d is a common protected class, as is \u201cwork\u201d.\n\n### Geek Social Fallacy #4: Friendship Is Transitive\n\nEvery carrier of GSF4 has, at some point, said: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great to get\nall my groups of friends into one place for one big happy party?!\u201d\n\nIf you groaned at that last paragraph, you may be a recovering GSF4 carrier.\n\nGSF4 is the belief that any two of your friends ought to be friends with each\nother, and if they\u2019re not, something is Very Wrong.\n\nThe milder form of GSF4 merely prevents the carrier from perceiving evidence\nto contradict it; a carrier will refuse to comprehend that two of their\nfriends (or two groups of friends) don\u2019t much care for each other, and will\ncontinue to try to bring them together at social events. They may even\nmaintain that a full-scale vendetta is just a misunderstanding between friends\nthat could easily be resolved if the principals would just sit down to talk it\nout.\n\nA more serious form of GSF4 becomes another \u201cfriendship test\u201d fallacy: if you\nhave a friend A, and a friend B, but A & B are not friends, then one of them\nmust not really be your friend at all. It is surprisingly common for a\ncarrier, when faced with two friends who don\u2019t get along, to simply drop one\nof them.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, a carrier who doesn\u2019t like a friend of a\nfriend will often get very passive-aggressive and covertly hostile to the\nfriend of a friend, while vigorously maintaining that we\u2019re one big happy\nfamily and everyone is friends.\n\nGSF4 can also lead carriers to make inappropriate requests of people they\nbarely know \u2014 asking a friend\u2019s roommate\u2019s ex if they can crash on their\ncouch, asking a college acquaintance from eight years ago for a letter of\nrecommendation at their workplace, and so on. If something is appropriate to\nask of a friend, it\u2019s appropriate to ask of a friend of a friend.\n\nArguably, Friendster was designed by a GSF4 carrier.\n\n### Geek Social Fallacy #5: Friends Do Everything Together\n\nGSF5, put simply, maintains that every friend in a circle should be included\nin every activity to the full extent possible. This is subtly different from\nGSF1; GSF1 requires that no one, friend or not, be excluded, while GSF5\nrequires that every friend be invited. This means that to a GSF5 carrier, not\nbeing invited to something is intrinsically a snub, and will be responded to\nas such.\n\nThis is perhaps the least destructive of the five, being at worst\ninconvenient. In a small circle, this is incestuous but basically harmless. In\nlarger groups, it can make certain social events very difficult: parties which\nare way too large for their spaces and restaurant expeditions that include\ntwenty people and no reservation are far from unusual.\n\nWhen everyone in a group is a GSF5 carrier, this isn\u2019t really a problem. If,\nhowever, there are members who aren\u2019t carriers, they may want occasionally to\nhave smaller outings, and these can be hard to arrange without causing hurt\nfeelings and social drama. It\u2019s hard to explain to a GSF5 carrier that just\nbecause you only wanted to have dinner with five other people tonight, it\ndoesn\u2019t mean that your friendship is in terrible danger.\n\nFor some reason, many GSF5 carriers are willing to make an exception for\ngender-segregated events. I don\u2019t know why.\n\n### Interactions\n\nEach fallacy has its own set of unfortunate consequences, but frequently they\nbecome worse in interaction. GSF4 often develops into its more extreme form\nwhen paired with GSF5; if everyone does everything together, it\u2019s much harder\nto maintain two friends who don\u2019t get along. One will usually fall by the\nwayside.\n\nSimilarly, GSF1 and GSF5 can combine regrettably: when a failure to invite\nsomeone is equivalent to excluding them, you can\u2019t even get away with not\ninviting Captain Halitosis along on the road trip. GSF3 can combine\ndisastrously with the other \u201cfriendship test\u201d fallacies; carriers may insist\nthat their friends join them in snubbing someone who fails the test, which\noccasionally leads to a chain reaction which causes the carrier to eventually\nreject all of their friends. This is not healthy; fortunately, severe versions\nof GSF3 are rare.\n\n### Consequences\n\nDealing with the effects of social fallacies is an essential part of managing\none\u2019s social life among geeks, and this is much easier when one is aware of\nthem and can identify which of your friends carry which fallacies. In the\nabsence of this kind of awareness, three situations tend to arise when people\ncome into contact with fallacies they don\u2019t hold themselves.\n\nMost common is simple conflict and hurt feelings. It\u2019s hard for people to talk\nthrough these conflicts because they usually stem from fairly primal value\nclashes; a GSF3 carrier may not even be able to articulate why it was such a\nbig deal that their non-carrier friend blew off their movie night.\n\nAlternately, people often take on fallacies that are dominant in their social\ncircle. If you join a group of GSF5 carriers, doing everything together is\ngoing to become a habit; if you spend enough time around GSF1 carriers,\nputting up with trolls is going to seem normal.\n\nLess commonly, people form a sort of counter-fallacy which I call \u201cYour\nFeelings, Your Problem\u201d. YFYP carriers deal with other people\u2019s fallacies by\nignoring them entirely, in the process acquiring a reputation for being\ncharmingly tactless. Carriers tend to receive a sort of exemption from the\nusual standards: \u201cthat\u2019s just Dana\u201d, and so on. YFYP has its own problems, but\nif you would rather be an asshole than angstful, it may be the way to go. It\u2019s\nalso remarkably easy to pull off in a GSF1-rich environment.\n\n### What Can I Do?\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, I think that the best way to deal with social fallacies is to be\naware of them, in yourself and in others. In yourself, you can try to deal\nwith them; in others, understanding their behavior usually makes it less\naggravating.\n\nSocial fallacies don\u2019t make someone a bad person; on the contrary, they\nusually spring from the purest motives. But I believe they are worth\ndeconstructing; in the long run, social fallacies cost a lot of stress and\ndrama, to no real benefit. You can be tolerant without being indiscriminate,\nand you can be loyal to friends without being compulsive about it.\n\n### Hey, Are You Talking About Me?\n\nIf I know you, yeah, probably I am. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you; most of\nus carry a few fallacies. Myself, I struggle with GSF 1 and 2, and I used to\nhave a bad case of 4 until a series of disastrous parties dispelled it.\n\nI haven\u2019t used any examples that refer to specific situations, if it has you\nworried. Any resemblances to geeks living or dead are coincidental.\n\nCategorieslies, UncategorizedTagsdrama, geek social fallacies, geeks\n\n## Recent Tweets\n\nTwitter feed is not available at the moment.\n\n## Tags\n\n## Archives\n\nProudly powered by WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
