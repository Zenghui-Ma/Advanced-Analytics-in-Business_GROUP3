It's a stack-based\nesoteric \"programming language\" that could hurt your ears. To write a program,\nyou play keys on the keyboard. Try it out on this page and watch your program\nexecute (listen to it as well!).\n\nThere are two basic commands: POP and PUSH. To pop an item off the stack, play\nD on the piano. To push an item, play C on the piano followed by your number\nin binary (D for 0, E for 1) or G/F for the saved variables, if available.\nWhen you're finished play C again.\n\nWe also have arithmetic functions. Play E followed by one of the following:\n\n  * F: to add the top two numbers from the stack.\n  * G: to subtract the top two numbers from the stack.\n  * A: to multiply the top two numbers from the stack.\n  * B: to divide the top two numbers from the stack.\n  * C: to absolute value the top number on the stack.\n  * D: to duplicate the top number on the stack.\n  * E: to perform modulo division with the top two numbers from the stack.\n\nAnd there's a bit of logic available. Play F followed by one of the following:\n\n  * G: a NOT operator. If the top number on the stack is a 0, makes it a 1. Otherwise, 0.\n  * A: greater than with the top two numbers on the stack. 1 if true, 0 if false.\n  * B: less than with the top two numbers on the stack. 1 if true, 0 if false.\n  * C: equals with the top two numbers on the stack. 1 if true, 0 if false.\n\nLastly, you can output the top item from your stack by playing G followed by\none of the following:\n\n  * A: outputs it as a number.\n  * B: outputs it as an ASCII character.\n  * C: saves it for later use in Slot A (only value per slot).\n  * D: saves it for later use in Slot B (only value per slot).\n\n### Playing this Piano\n\nClick the S key to make a play the C note, then D to make D4 and so on up\nuntil B4 with the K key.\n\nTo hit a black key, use SHIFT.\n\nTo move up and down the piano, click \u2b05\ufe0e and \u2b95. Your current section is 4\n\nC D E F G A B\n\n    \n    \n    OUTPUT:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
