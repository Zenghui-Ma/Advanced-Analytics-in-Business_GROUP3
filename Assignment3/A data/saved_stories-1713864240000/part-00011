Drawing on themes from the seven\ncontributions to this special issue, we argue that what can and cannot be said\ninside of mainstream computer science publications appears to be constrained\nby the power, wealth, and ideology of a small cohort of industrialists. The\nresult is that shaping discourse about the AI industry is itself a form of\npower that cannot be named inside of computer science. We argue that naming\nand grappling with this power, and the troubled history of core commitments\nbehind the pursuit of general artificial intelligence, is necessary for the\nintegrity of the field and the well-being of the people whose lives are\nimpacted by AI.\n\n## Downloads\n\n  * HTML\n  * PDF\n\n## Published\n\n2024-04-14\n\n## How to Cite\n\nBurrell, J., & Metcalf, J.
