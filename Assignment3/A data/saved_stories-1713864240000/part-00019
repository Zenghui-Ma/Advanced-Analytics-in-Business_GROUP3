A Quirky Correlation Analysis\nAs the name Theodore gained popularity, more parents were inspired by\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt, known for his strong conservation efforts. This\nled to a spike in naming children after him and a surge in environmental\nawareness in Burundi. Curiously, this prompted a nationwide school project to\nexcavate and study fossils, inadvertently requiring an excessive use of heavy\nmachinery and fuel to power the digging, much to the dismay of the country's\nconservation efforts.

Data dredging: I have 25,237 variables in my database. I compare all these variables against each other to find ones that randomly match up. That's 636,906,169 correlation calculations! This is called \u201cdata dredging.\u201d Fun fact: the chart used on the wikipedia page to demonstrate data dredging is also from me. I've been being naughty with data since 2014. Instead of starting with a hypothesis and testing it, I instead tossed a bunch of data in a blender to see what correlations would shake out. It\u2019s a dangerous way to go about analysis, because any sufficiently large dataset will yield strong correlations completely at random.\n  2. Lack of causal connection: There is probably no direct connection between these variables, despite what the AI says above. Because these pages are automatically generated, it's possible that the two variables you are viewing are in fact causually related. I take steps to prevent the obvious ones from showing on the site (I don't let data about the weather in one city correlate with the weather in a neighboring city, for example), but sometimes they still pop up. If they are related, cool! You found a loophole. This is exacerbated by the fact that I used \"Years\" as the base variable. Lots of things happen in a year that are not related to each other! Most studies would use something like \"one person\" in stead of \"one year\" to be the \"thing\" studied.\n  3. Observations not independent: For many variables, sequential years are not independent of each other. You will often see trend-lines form. If a population of people is continuously doing something every day, there is no reason to think they would suddenly change how they are doing that thing on January 1. A naive p-value calculation does not take this into account. You will calculate a lower chance of \"randomly\" achieving the result than represents reality.\n\nTo be more specific: p-value tests are probability values, where you are\ncalculating the probability of achieving a result at least as extreme as you\nfound completely by chance. When calculating a p-value, you need to assert how\nmany \"degrees of freedom\" your variable has. I count each year (minus one) as\na \"degree of freedom,\" but this is misleading for continuous variables.\n\nThis kind of thing can creep up on you pretty easily when using p-values,\nwhich is why it's best to take it as \"one of many\" inputs that help you assess\nthe results of your analysis.\n\n  4. Y-axes doesn't start at zero: I truncated the Y-axes of the graphs above. I also used a line graph, which makes the visual connection stand out more than it deserves. Nothing against line graphs. They are great at telling a story when you have linear data! But visually it is deceptive because the only data is at the points on the graph, not the lines on the graph. In between each point, the data could have been doing anything. Like going for a random walk by itself! Mathematically what I showed is true, but it is intentionally misleading. If you click on any of the charts that abuse this, you can scroll down to see a version that starts at zero.\n  5. Confounding variable: Confounding variables (like global pandemics) will cause two variables to look connected when in fact a \"sneaky third\" variable is influencing both of them behind the scenes.\n  6. Outliers: Some datasets here have outliers which drag up the correlation. In concept, \"outlier\" just means \"way different than the rest of your dataset.\" When calculating a correlation like this, they are particularly impactful because a single outlier can substantially increase your correlation.\n\nBecause this page is automatically generated, I don't know whether any of the\ncharts displayed on it have outliers. I'm just a footnote. \u0304\\\\_(\u30c4)_/ \u0304 I\nintentionally mishandeled outliers, which makes the correlation look extra\nstrong.\n\n  7. Low n: There are not many data points included in some of these charts. You can do analyses with low ns! But you shouldn't data dredge with a low n. Even if the p-value is high, we should be suspicious of using so few datapoints in a correlation.\n\nPro-tip: click on any correlation to see:\n\n  * Detailed data sources\n  * Prompts for the AI-generated content\n  * Explanations of each of the calculations (correlation, p-value)\n  * Python code to calculate it yourself\n\nProject by Tyler Vigen emailme@tylervigen.com \u00b7 about \u00b7 subscribe  \n---  \n  \nCC BY 4.0\n\n", "frontpage": false}
