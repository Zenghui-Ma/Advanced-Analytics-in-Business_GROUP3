Here Comes the Bust\n\nSales of vegan meat are trending downward in the US, with companies scrambling\nto win back customers.\n\nCourtesy of Beyond Meat\n\nOver the past three years, the plant-based meat industry has experienced a\nmajor reversal in vibes. Sales boomed in the early months of the pandemic, as\nslaughterhouse shutdowns disrupted conventional meat supply chains and\nshoppers started trying out meatless burgers, sausages, and seafood instead.\nBetween 2018 and 2021, total sales of plant-based foods in the US grew from\n$4.8 billion to $7.4 billion, with much of that growth driven by plant-based\nmeat in particular.\n\nBut a new report on sales of vegan meat, dairy, and seafood suggests that\nenthusiasm for plant-based products might be slowing down. An annual report\nfrom the Good Food Institute, an alternative protein nonprofit, found that\ndollar sales of plant-based meat and seafood in the US fell by 13 percent over\nthe past two years. As prices of meat alternatives have gone up, this masks a\nmuch greater drop in unit sales over the same time period\u2014they fell by 26\npercent between 2021 and 2023.\n\nOne big challenge in the US is the price of plant-based alternatives. In the\nUS, plant-based meats are on average 77 percent more expensive than their\nanimal equivalents, and for cheap meat like chicken, that premium rises to\nmore than 150 percent. Another problem is one that has dogged the industry for\nyears: Shoppers are still finding plant-based products lackluster compared to\nanimal-based alternatives. \u201cMany consumers signaled that products weren\u2019t yet\nmeeting their expectations on taste, texture, and affordability,\u201d wrote the\nauthors of the report.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nAlthough there has been a lot of excitement around meat alternatives, plant-\nbased milk is still by far the biggest seller when it comes to plant-based\nfoods. Dairy milk alternatives like soy, oat, and almond made up nearly 15\npercent of total milk sales in the US, while the share of plant-based meat and\nseafood in their market is around 1 percent. Plant-based milks alone make up\nnearly a third of the entire plant-based food category in the US, as defined\nby the Good Food Institute.\n\nIf you add together all other adjacent sectors, including plant-based butter,\nice cream, yogurt, and cheese, then US sales of plant-based dairy alternatives\naccounted for nearly $5 billion in 2023. Dollar sales of plant-based milk grew\nby 9 percent through 2021\u201323, although unit sales declined by 10 percent over\nthe same period. Total sales in the plant-based sector, according to the Good\nFood Institute, were $8.1 billion.\n\nFans of plant-based meat point out that people swapping beef burgers for\nplant-based patties would significantly reduce the carbon footprints of our\ndiets. Animal proteins are a major source of emissions from food, with beef,\nlamb, and dairy contributing the highest emissions per kilogram of product.\nBut with plant-based meat sales stalling, it\u2019s unclear whether the industry is\nhaving the impact on carbon emissions that many hope for.\n\nProminent brands within the space are trying to move beyond the morass.\nEarlier this year, Impossible Foods relaunched its range of alternatives with\na new, meatier style deliberately aimed at bringing \u201cmeat lovers\u201d into the\nplant-based fold. In February, Beyond Meat launched the fourth-generation\nversion of its burger and ground beef, calling them \u201cour meatiest, juiciest\nproducts yet.\u201d\n\nRising concerns about so-called ultraprocessed food have also buffeted the\nplant-based meat industry, given the high amount of processing usually needed\nto make its products. In response, Beyond\u2019s new burgers have less salt and\nsaturated fat than the previous generation, as well as a \u201csimplified\ningredient list,\u201d while many other plant-based companies are emphasizing their\n\u201cclean-label\u201d credentials.\n\nWhether this plant-based pivot succeeds or not, there is a lot at stake when\nit comes to the climate impact of our diets. For now, it seems, the plant-\nbased revolution\u2014in the US at least\u2014is getting a slower start than many hoped.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nA Wave of AI Tools Is Set to Transform Work Meetings\n\nSteven Levy\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 32 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
