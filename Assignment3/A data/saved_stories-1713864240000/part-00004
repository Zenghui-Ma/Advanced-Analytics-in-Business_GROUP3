Just overall. For a few months, I felt\nI did a good (at least decent) job posting inspired content on this site. I\nwas also learning steadily and making good progress on my programming. But in\nrecent months, less so. I tried to focus on specific projects, but I couldn\u2019t\nstick to any of them for long. As such, I didn\u2019t produce anything particularly\ninteresting. In short, I went from curious exploring to frantic jumping\nbetween projects.\n\nMaybe the reason for this is that school has been coming to an end, which\nmeans I have had to spend more time studying for exams recently. It\u2019s\nreasonable to think that the slow mounting daunt of final exams would increase\npressure and dilute focus. But really, I was working diligently for school\nbefore, and I managed to stress myself with exams more than enough in the\npast. The amount of free time I have also hasn\u2019t changed for the worse. So I\ndeem this an internal issue.\n\nI think the problem is very clear: I piled up more and more tasks to work on\nat the same time. In effect, this hinders my progress since I can\u2019t really\nfocus on any single one of them, and thus I can\u2019t do good work. To progress, I\nneed to decide. I have to do one thing at a time.\n\nSome things I just have to reject for now. That\u2019s OK. I have to learn things\nstep-by-step, one after the other. I have time for that. In fact, I can only\nmaximize my skills if I can focus. But I can\u2019t focus if I hastily attempt to\nmaster all skills at once. I want to be good at a broad range of tasks. But to\nbe really good, I have to go deep as well. And from my recent experience, it\nseems obvious to me that I need a different approach. Now is the time to pick\nout a small set of challenges and really dive in. I have to fundamentally say\nno to all other enterprises that might distract me.\n\nIt\u2019s also important that I let things pass. Over and over again, I have\naccumulated endless piles of bookmarks and notes on what to read and what to\nwrite. It\u2019s great that I have this much to think about, but it\u2019s also\ndistracting. All of these reminders that I constantly jot down for myself\u2013any\nsystems that I try to develop to organize them\u2013I\u2019ll have to give up on that.\nSo far, I\u2019ve been doing this collecting out of fear of missing out on some\nvaluable information. But building up such a backlog is not productive. Even\nworse, it simply diverts focus.\n\nMy strategy is this: don\u2019t fixate what topics to work on, but fixate\neverything else. Then, don\u2019t make any changes to the fixed set. I\u2019m not going\nto rule out whole topics by themselves. Rather, I want to set myself a\nframework of conditions that make it easy to stay focused on the work that I\nwant to do.\n\nFor example, no more text editor switching. Emacs is about good enough for all\nI need. And there certainly are no alternatives that would boost my\nproductivity enough to make up for the distraction that the switch would\nincur.\n\nSecond, no more Rust (I know, I\u2019m deeply torn myself). I want to improve my\nfoundational knowledge. For 90% of that, I don\u2019t need to sharpen my\nunderstanding of any fancy new languages. Instead, I\u2019ll just stick to C and\nfocus on content instead of language.\n\nThird, no more HN (this will probably turn out as less HN in practice). Sure,\nHN is great for discovering things and also pretty good entertainment, but,\nreally, it\u2019s a distraction most of the time. If I need to find good material\non a topic, I can just use HN to search for it directly (I already do that\nsince Google search doesn\u2019t work anymore). If I want to explore, then sure, I\ncan use HN deliberately. But exposing myself to the plethora of fascinating\nprojects that HN has to offer too often isn\u2019t healthy (for months now,\nbreakfast and HN have been coupled tightly).\n\nI\u2019m also deleting some of the stuff on this website that I don\u2019t think is\nactually very interesting.\n\nThat\u2019s all I have for now. I\u2019ll probably think of more rules in the future. In\nthat case, I\u2019ll update this page. I\u2019m putting this out here to hold myself\naccountable and to get better at getting things out there (something I\ngenerally want to improve at). Have fun exploring.\n\nI liked this kind of pattern at the bottom of OpenAI's site :)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
