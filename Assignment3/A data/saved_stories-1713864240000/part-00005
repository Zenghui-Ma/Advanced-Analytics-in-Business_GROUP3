It\u2019s up to\nlawmakers now\n\nState and federal lawmakers are working on various regulations to restrict\nchildren\u2019s access to social media platforms.\n\n(NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBy The Times Editorial Board\n\nApril 22, 2024 5 AM PT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * Print\n\nFrom state capitols to Washington, D.C., lawmakers are scrambling to come up\nwith regulations that can protect kids from the potential harms of social\nmedia, since the platforms have been unwilling to adopt reasonable safeguards\nthemselves.\n\nIn just the last few months, Florida passed a law banning children under age\n14 from having a social media account, Iowa legislators backed a bill that\nwould require children younger than 18 to get parental permission to set up\nand use a social media account, and Colorado legislators passed a bill that\nwould require platforms to display pop-up warnings on kids\u2019 accounts after an\nhour of use.\n\nA dozen other states, including California, are considering or have passed\nlaws that would force companies to design their platforms to be safer for\nkids. Changes could include stricter privacy settings, limiting data\ncollection and targeted ads, and removing features that encourage kids to stay\nonline longer, such as infinite scroll and autoplay, which automatically\nlaunches a new video when one ends. Congress is also working on bipartisan\nlegislation with similar measures to require social media companies to enact\nsafeguards to protect children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion\n\n### Opinion: Social media can be toxic for women. Here\u2019s how to change that\n\nSocial networks such as Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn can negatively affect\nwomen\u2019s lives offline too.\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nThis legislation is driven by a growing understanding that social media apps\ncan be addictive and are dangerous to children\u2019s mental health. The American\nPsychological Assn. urged again this month that policymakers require that tech\ncompanies reduce the risks embedded in the platforms.\n\nYet the drive for regulation is facing stiff pushback from the tech industry,\nwhich has lobbied against the bills and filed lawsuits to block new\nlegislation from taking effect, arguing the laws are unconstitutional.\nCalifornia\u2019s first-in-the-nation law to require that social media platforms be\ndesigned to protect children was blocked in the fall by a federal judge who\nsaid the law likely violates the 1st Amendment rights of the tech companies\nthat it seeks to regulate.\n\nWith California\u2019s first attempt held up in court, lawmakers are trying again\nthis year.\n\nOpinion\n\n### Opinion: There\u2019s a clear way to regulate Facebook, TikTok and other social\nmedia\n\nWith Google, Amazon, Twitter and other companies scaling back their safety\nteams, self-regulation is less likely, and AI poses big risks.\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nSenate Bill 976 by Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) would require that social\nmedia platforms essentially turn off their algorithms for users under 18 and\ninstead serve them content through a chronological feed from people they\nfollow and information that they\u2019ve searched for. The algorithms are designed\nto feed users a steady stream of content they didn\u2019t necessarily ask for that\nkeeps them on the app, which is why the algorithms have been called addictive.\nThat content may be more dangerous or extreme than what the user initially\nsearched for or not age-appropriate.\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, who sued Meta last year\nalleging the company used harmful and \u201cpsychologically manipulative product\nfeatures,\u201d such as \u201clikes,\u201d infinite scroll and constant alerts, to hook young\npeople on Instagram and Facebook and keep them engaged for as much time as\npossible in order to boost profits.\n\nOpinion\n\n### Editorial: Social media can harm kids. Lawsuits could force Meta, others\nto make platforms safer\n\nStates have sued Facebook\u2019s parent company, saying it knew Instagram and other\nproducts could harm young users\u2019 mental health but didn\u2019t do enough to help.\n\nOct. 26, 2023\n\nSB 976 attempts to curtail some of those features. It would bar platforms from\nsending notifications to children between 12 and 6 a.m. and require that\nsocial media platforms give parents the ability to change the settings on\ntheir kids\u2019 accounts, such as turning off notifications and setting time\nlimits on usage. Parents could allow kids to opt in to the algorithmic feed or\nturn off restrictions.\n\nThese are reasonable safeguards and much less restrictive than proposals in\nother states, yet tech industry groups have opposed the bill. They argue that\na chronological feed is no safer for children than an algorithmic feed; bad\nactors could flood a chronological feed with low quality or harmful content\nthat bury posts from family or friends. They also said the bill will run up\nagainst the same 1st Amendment challenges as other laws because, along with\nlimiting a minor\u2019s ability to access and share information, it would impede\nadults\u2019 access to lawful content because adults would have to prove their age\nto use the less restricted algorithmic feed and settings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s likely that any law attempting to put guardrails on social media\nplatforms will face legal challenges. This is complex legal and regulatory\nterrain, but that\u2019s exactly why California lawmakers should keep pushing ahead\nwith SB 976 and similar efforts. The tech industry has been unwilling to\nvoluntarily change its practices to protect children. Lawmakers have to do it\nfor them.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### AI-generated child pornography is circulating.
