Here\u2019s Why.\n\u2013 Shelf Talk\n\nSkip to content\n\nShelf Talk\n\n# The Seattle Public Library Is Reducing Our Maximum Digital Holds. Here\u2019s\nWhy.\n\nStarting Tuesday, March 19, The Seattle Public Library is reducing the number\nof maximum holds allowed on e-books and e-audiobooks from 25 to 10.\n\nPlease note that if you have more than 10 holds on digital books at that time,\nyou won\u2019t lose any of these holds. You just won\u2019t be able to place new holds\nuntil you\u2019re within the new limit. Also, the limit for digital borrowing has\nnot changed \u2013 you can still borrow up to 25 digital books at a time.\n\nWhile the vast majority of our patrons won\u2019t be affected by this change, we\nwant to explain why the Library needed to reduce the holds limit to manage\nspending and meet increasing patron interest in digital books. In the Q&A\nbelow, we also share some tips for alternative tools you can use for tracking\nbooks you want to read and making the most of your Library account.\n\nWhy did the Library need to make this change?\n\nIf you\u2019ve started borrowing digital books from the Library in recent years,\nyou\u2019ve been part of the biggest shift in library lending in recent history.\n\nAlthough the popularity of digital books was rising before 2020, the pandemic\naccelerated this trend. At The Seattle Public Library, annual checkouts of\ndigital books almost tripled from 2015 to 2022, as did costs.\n\nThe Library has increased investment in digital collections to meet patron\ninterest. Unfortunately, because of the way digital books are priced for\nlibraries, meeting increased demand has come at a cost that has become\nunsustainable.\n\nWhy are digital books so expensive?\n\nAs a consumer, when you buy an e-book or e-audiobook, it costs about the same\nor sometimes even less than the print book version. But for libraries, the\ne-book or e-audiobook version of a title actually costs up to three times or\nmore than the print version.\n\nThis is because publishers use a licensing model for selling e-books to\nlibraries. Each copy of a digital book title requires a purchase of a license.\nWhile there are many types of licenses, the most common license needs to be\npurchased and then re-purchased every year.\n\nWhat do holds have to do with the cost of digital books?\n\nThis may seem surprising, but patron holds are the single biggest factor in\nrising costs. To maintain reasonable wait times, the Library buys additional\nlicenses of a digital title when patrons place more holds on it. That means\nthat when hundreds of patrons place holds on a single New York Times\nbestseller, the costs of \u201cbuying down the holds\u201d can quickly become\nastronomical.\n\nIn 2023, 62% of the Library\u2019s spending on digital books was used to purchase\nadditional copies to fulfill holds placed on popular titles.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, Library costs for meeting increased patron\ninterest in popular e-books have nearly tripled since 2015. Reducing the\nnumber of holds the Library allows can help us better manage these costs,\nwhich will allow us to continue providing a broad and diverse selection of\ne-books and e-audiobooks, and to meet patron demand all year.\n\nIs this change being made due to the City\u2019s budget challenges?\n\nNo, this change is part of routine service assessments and adjustments the\nLibrary makes to ensure we are aligning our services with our current\nbudgetary and staffing resources. The Library has been monitoring rising costs\nof digital books for several years and has been assessing the best course of\naction to manage these increasing costs. The change to our maximum holds limit\nfor digital books is being made now so that we can continue to maintain\nreasonable wait times as costs and popularity of these materials continue to\nrise.\n\nThat all makes sense. But I use my Libby holds list as my \u201cto be read\u201d wish\nlist. What else can I do?\n\nIf you tend to place holds on digital books through the Library\u2019s online\ncatalog, we encourage you to check out the \u201cShelves\u201d feature in the online\ncatalog, which allows you to tag books you want to read in the future. If you\nuse OverDrive\u2019s Libby app to place holds on and borrow digital books, you can\nuse the \u201cTags\u201d feature to easily create a wish list. Check the Libby Help\nsection for more information.\n\nDo you have other suggestions for finding great digital books that are\navailable without a wait?\n\nYes! You can check out hundreds of e-books and e-audiobooks right away, with\nno holds, through OverDrive\u2019s Always Available collection. It includes a wide\nrange of popular e-books and e-audiobooks, and the collection is always\nchanging. Look for the Always Available collection in the e-book catalog or,\nin Libby, look for the Available Now section.\n\nFurther reading: If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the topic of\ndigital book pricing and how that affects libraries, you can explore further\nat this GovTech article: \u201cBehind E-Books, Libraries Find Restrictions and High\nCosts.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Elisa M., Communications\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nMaking a Library Purchase SuggestionAugust 16, 2017In \"Library Services\"\n\nStay Home, Stay Healthy.

Or allow patrons who need maximum digital holds to access\nthem for a small fee just like renting a room?
