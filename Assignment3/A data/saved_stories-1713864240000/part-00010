Real-life\npictures of the \"Pixel 9 Pro\" model have landed over at Rozetked.\n\nThis prototype looks just like the renders from OnLeaks that first came out\nback in January. The biggest change is a new pill-shaped camera bump instead\nof the edge-to-edge design of old models. It looks rather stylish in real-life\nphotos, with the rounded corners of the pill and camera glass matching the\nbody shape. The matte back looks like it still uses the excellent \"soft-touch\nglass\" material from last year. The front and back of the phone are totally\nflat, with a metal band around the side. The top edge still has a signal\nwindow cut out of it, which is usually for mmWave. The Pixel 8 Pro's near-\nuseless temperature sensor appears to still be on the back of this prototype.\nAt least, the spot for the temperature sensor\u2014the silver disk right below the\nLED camera flash\u2014looks identical to the Pixel 8 Pro. As a prototype any of\nthis could change before the final release, but this is what it looks like\nright now.\n\nThe phone was helpfully photographed next to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, and you\nmight notice that the Pixel 9 Pro looks a little small! That's because this is\none of the small models, with only a 6.1-inch display. Previously for Pixels,\n\"Pro\" meant \"the big model,\" but this year Google is supposedly shipping three\nmodels, adding in a top-tier small phone. There's the usual big Pixel 9, with\na 6.7-inch display, which will reportedly be called the \"Pixel 9 Pro XL.\" The\nnew model is the \"Pixel 9 Pro\"\u2014no XL\u2014which is a small model but still with all\nthe \"Pro\" trimmings, like three rear cameras. There's also the Pixel 9 base\nmodel, which is the usual smaller phone (6.03-inch) with cut-down specs like\nonly two rear cameras.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / The Pixel 9 Pro prototype. It's small because this is the \"small\nPro\" model. There are more pictures over at Rozetked.\n\nRozetked\n\n### Further Reading\n\nGoogle says running AI models on phones is a huge RAM hog\n\nRozetked says (through translation) that the phone is \"similar in size to the\niPhone 15 Pro.\" It runs a Tensor G4 SoC, of course, and\u2014here's a noteworthy\nspec\u2014has a whopping 16GB of RAM according to the bootloader screen. The Pixel\n8 Pro tops out at 12GB.\n\nAnything could change between prototype and product, especially for RAM, which\nis usually scaled up and down in various phone tiers. A jump in RAM is\nsomething we were expecting though. As part of Google's new AI-focused era, it\nwants generative AI models turned on 24/7 for some use cases. Google said as\nmuch in a recent in-house podcast, pointing to some features like a new\nversion of Smart Reply built right into the keyboard, which \"requires the\nmodels to be RAM-resident\"\u2014in other words, loaded all the time. Google's\ndesire to keep generative AI models in memory means less RAM for your\noperating system to actually do operating system things, and one solution to\nthat is to just add more RAM. So how much RAM is enough? At one point Google\nsaid the smaller Pixel 8's 8GB of RAM was too much of a \"hardware limitation\"\nfor this approach. Google PR also recently told us the company still hasn't\nenabled generative AI smart reply on Pixel 8 Pro by default with its 12GB of\nRAM, so expect these RAM numbers to start shooting up.\n\nThe downside is that more RAM means a more expensive phone, but this is the\npath Google is going down. There's also the issue of whether or not you view\ngenerative AI as something that is so incredibly useful you need it built into\nyour keyboard 24/7. Google wants its hardware to be \"the intersection of\nhardware, software, and AI,\" so keeping all this ChatGPT-like stuff\nquarantined to a single app apparently won't be an option.\n\nOne final note: It's weird how normal this phone looks. Usually, Pixel\nprototypes have a unique logo that isn't the Google \"G,\" and often they are\ncovered in identifying patterns for leak tracing. This looks like a\nproduction-worthy design, though.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n63\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
