Others are creating \u2018real\u2019 cultivated meat, in a process\nthat typically takes animal cells and cultivates - or grows - them in a\nlaboratory setting, not dissimilar to the way that beer is fermented.\n\nNow, Finland-based Solar Foods has announced its unique approach to making a\nmore sustainable food system: growing protein out of air.\n\nThe company has just opened the world\u2019s first air protein factory, based near\nthe Finnish capital of Helsinki. At the facility, Solar Foods will operate a\ncommercial-scale production of Solein, its signature air protein, which\ncombines a tiny but mighty micro-organism with CO2 - known simply as air - to\ngrow it into a nutritious yellow powder. The bioprocess is said to resemble\nwinemaking.\n\nOnce the production cycle is complete, the resulting Solein powder can be used\nwith a wide range of traditional ingredients - it\u2019s already been made into\nlimited-edition food products like a Solein-powered snack bar and a Solein\nchocolate gelato.\n\nSolein powder.

While we have been\nable to offer consumers a small taste, finding a Solein-based food in your\nlocal supermarket has not been possible. Soon it will be\u201d, Solar Foods\u2019 CEO\nand co-founder Pasi Vainikka explains.\n\nThe Solein powder can be used in a variety of foods, like the above snack bar.\nCredit: Solar Foods\n\nCellular agriculture, where protein is produced in a factory-setting without\nkilling animals, is also known as lab-grown or cultivated agriculture, and it\nis regarded as a leading solution to the world\u2019s unsustainable demand for meat\nand the huge carbon footprint associated with meat production.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Solar Foods explains that the newly-built\nfactory\u2019s bioreactor can grow the same amount of Solein protein per day as a\n300-cow dairy farm would produce milk protein. Crucially, the difference is\nthat Solein can be produced by being \u201centirely decoupled\u201d from the demands and\nenvironmental stress of traditional agriculture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question of will cellular agriculture become a thing: it\u2019s\nevident that it will\u201d, Vainikka says. The CEO explains that \u201c[the factory]\ndemonstrates it is possible to grow protein from start to finish under one\nroof, year-round even in the harsh Northern conditions of Finland \u2013 and to do\nit all sustainably and in a commercially viable manner.\u201d\n\nIt is expected that products using air protein will initially launch in\nSingapore, which was the first market to grant Solein regulatory approval.\nSolar Foods says it is also seeking authorizations in other markets across the\nworld too.\n\nShare on facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n## We Have A Favor To Ask...\n\nSpecies Unite amplifies well-researched solutions to some of the most abusive\nanimal industries operating today.\n\nAt this crucial moment, with worldwide momentum for change building, it\u2019s\nvital we share these animal-free solutions with the world - and we need your\nhelp.\n\nWe\u2019re a nonprofit, and so to keep sharing these solutions, we\u2019re relying on\nyou - with your support, we can continue our essential work in growing a\npowerful community of animal advocates this year.\n\n## More stories:\n\nFeatured\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nBirth Control Could Help Manage Rats in NYC, New Bill Suggests\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nApr 18, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nFuture of Food: This Company Just Opened the World\u2019s First \u201cAir Protein\u201d\nFactory\n\nApr 18, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nApr 18, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nGlobal Attempts to Ban \u201cMeaty\u201d Labels on Plant-Based Foods Aren\u2019t Working\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nPaul Healey\n\nEat featured\n\nPaul Healey\n\n### Comments (0)\n\nNewest First\n\nPreview Post Comment...\n\nPrevious\n\nPrevious\n\n## Birth Control Could Help Manage Rats in NYC, New Bill Suggests\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## Global Attempts to Ban \u201cMeaty\u201d Labels on Plant-Based Foods Aren\u2019t Working\n\nHome About Our Team Subscribe Contact\n\nPodcast News Campaigns Petitions\n\nBecome a Member Donate Partnerships Privacy Policy\n\nSpecies Unite 23 Inc.
