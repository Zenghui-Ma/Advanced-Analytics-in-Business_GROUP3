It was the first commercial\nimaging satellite capable of acquiring data that rivaled the resolution of spy\nsatellites. Curiously, the reporter, D\u2019Vera Cohn, failed to mention that one\nof the industries that would be changed by satellite imagery would be the news\nbusiness itself.\n\nThe launch of Ikonos was one of a handful of developments that allowed\nnewsrooms to expand from reporting on rocket launches and satellite hardware,\nto using remote sensing data as an essential tool to help tell stories. A wide\nvariety of satellite data are now used to provide context to the news, to\ndocument events, and as a tool for investigation.\n\nTeams with expertise in a range of fields \u2013 investigative reporting, writing,\ndesign, programming, and data analysis \u2013 are conducting the most novel and\nimpactful data journalism.\n\nA handful of factors combined with the advent of commercial high-resolution\ndata to help make remote sensing a resource for journalists. In the early\n2000s, data from government research satellites became widely available for no\ncost. This trend culminated in 2008 when the entire archive of Landsat data,\nwhich once cost thousands of dollars per image, was released for free.\n\nAt the same time, advances in computers enabled rapid processing and storage\nof large datasets. Google\u2019s Earth Engine and other cloud computing services\nallow types of analysis, especially of time series, that once required\nsupercomputers. Finally, an ecosystem of free and open source software has\nevolved to supplement the boutique commercial applications that were once\nrequired to read the (sometimes esoteric) formats used to store and distribute\nremote sensing data.\n\nInstead of reporting on a scientist\u2019s research or claims made by an\nintelligence agency, reporters could now tell their own stories with this\ndata.\n\n#### Images for Investigations\n\nTo me, the most exciting use of satellite imagery in journalism is for\ninvestigative reporting \u2013 data as a research tool, used to make discoveries\nand draw inferences. One early and innovative example came from Reveal News in\nthe story Who is the Wet Prince of Bel Air? Here are the Likely Culprits.\n\nThe reporters \u2013 Michael Corey and Lance Williams \u2013 used a combination of\ntechniques to identify the largest residential users of water in Los Angeles\nduring the California drought of the mid 2010s. (State water agencies released\na list of their largest water users, but could not share names or addresses.)\n\nThis map shows the largest residential consumers of water in Los Angeles \u2013\nidentified through the analysis of data from NAIP and Landsat. The map itself,\nhowever, is an example of the use of imagery as context. Image from the story:\nWho is the Wet Prince of Bel Air? Here are the Likely Culprits, by Michael\nCorey and Lance Williams for Reveal News. Image: Screenshot, map data from\nGoogle, City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, and the US Census Bureau\n\nA measure of vegetation health called the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI) helped identify properties in Los Angeles with large expanses of\nlush greenery. The vegetation measurements were derived from National\nAgriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data, a free source of high-resolution\naerial and satellite imagery refreshed every few years. This was combined with\nestimates of soil moisture from Landsat data, which is lower resolution than\nNAIP but provides information in additional wavelengths. The combined datasets\ngave more reliable estimates of water use than either technique used alone. To\nreduce the uncertainty further, Reveal even looked at the proportion of grass,\ntrees, and shrubs on each property.\n\nThe result? A list of locations, each annually consuming millions of gallons\nof water, and an investigation by the Los Angeles City Council. An example of\ninvestigative journalism having an impact on the actions of local government.\n\nInstead of reporting on a scientist\u2019s research or claims made by an\nintelligence agency, reporters could now tell their own stories with this\ndata.\n\nA primary use of satellite data is to be able to monitor inaccessible\nlocations. A great example of this is Bellingcat\u2019s efforts to track illicit\nshipping of grain from the port of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea, Ukraine. In\naddition to being in a war zone, ships docking in Sevastopol often turn off\ntheir Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder \u2013 effectively hiding\ntheir location. By obscuring their movements, ships can evade sanctions on\nexports from Sevastopol and transport stolen grain.\n\nAs with Reveal, the Bellingcat team combined multiple types of data to track\nhidden activity for the story Grain Trail: Tracking Russia\u2019s Ghost Ships with\nSatellite Imagery. They used commercial high- and very-high resolution optical\nPlanetScope and SkySat imagery from Planet, plus open access medium-resolution\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1. The Planet imagery\nrevealed a ship docked at the Avlita grain terminal on more than 100 days in\nthe year following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite incomplete\ncoverage and frequent cloudiness.\n\nSentinel-1 SAR data analyzed with the Ship Detection Tool (a machine learning\nalgorithm run on Google Earth Engine) determined there was a ship present at\nthe terminal on more than two-dozen additional days. SAR can penetrate clouds,\nbut is not available as frequently as Planet\u2019s optical imagery, so even the\ncombined dataset is likely an undercount.\n\nBellingcat reporters augmented the satellite data with photographs of the\nAvlita grain terminal in Sevastopol, and the Bosphorus Strait that links the\nBlack Sea with the Mediterranean. This \u201cground truth\u201d information helped the\nresearchers identify and track the individual ships spotted in Crimea. The\ncombined datasets reveal the larger scope of illegal grain shipments in a way\nthat is more comprehensive than any of the techniques alone.\n\nGrid of images showing ships docked next to the Avlita grain terminal in\nSevastopol, a port city in Russian occupied Crimea, Ukraine. Image:\nScreenshot, Bellingcat\n\nLike Bellingcat, The New York Times used a mix of ground-based evidence,\nsatellite data, and machine learning to monitor illicit activity. But instead\nof monitoring the motions of ships through time, the Times staff mapped\nunregistered airstrips across the Brazilian Amazon. They then analyzed\nadditional satellite data to document illegal mining that occurred near the\nairstrips, and tracked aircraft delivering supplies.\n\nFlight paths are indicated on a high-res satellite image showing individual\nairstrips, complementing the overview provided by the map. Image, Screenshot\nfrom the story: The Illegal Airstrips Bringing Toxic Mining to Brazil\u2019s\nIndigenous Land, by Manuela Andreoni, Blacki Migliozzi, Pablo Robles, and\nDenise Lu. New York Times. August 2, 2022\n\nAnother example of researchers using machine learning and satellite data to\ndetect illegal activity is Myanmar\u2019s Poisoned Mountains by Global Witness.\nSince they\u2019re advocates and not journalists they don\u2019t quite fit, but I think\nthe story of the growth of illegal rare earth mines along Myanmar\u2019s border\nwith China is one worth reading.\n\nOne of the more creative uses of satellite data I\u2019ve seen is an analysis of\nthe flight of the Chinese surveillance balloon that passed over Canada and the\nUnited States in early 2023. The story started with a machine learning\napproach similar to those I\u2019ve already described, which was used to locate the\nballoon over North America and then track it back to Hainan Island, China. But\nthat left an outstanding question \u2013 was the path of the balloon driven solely\nby wind currents? Or was it being actively guided? With no known source of\npropulsion, the only way to steer the balloon would be to adjust its altitude\nuntil it was carried along by favorable winds.\n\nTracking the Chinese Balloon From Space, by Muyi Xiao, Ishaan Jhaveri, Eleanor\nLutz, Christoph Koettl, and Julian E. Barnes. Image: Screenshot, The New York\nTimes. March 20, 2023\n\nThe Times\u2019s Visual Investigations team took advantage of a quirk present in\nmost satellite imagery \u2013 each color is collected at a slightly different time\n\u2013 to determine the balloon\u2019s altitude. (You may have noticed rainbow planes\nwhile browsing Google Earth or similar satellite-driven map. The phenomenon is\nsimilar, except there\u2019s additional spacing between each color due to an\naircraft\u2019s high speed.) Essentially, by knowing the speed and altitude of the\nsatellite, and the elapsed time between each picture, they could estimate the\nballoon\u2019s altitude with trigonometry. They concluded the balloon was, in fact,\nbeing guided \u2013 at least over some of its journey.\n\nProPublica is well known for their deep dives into American politics, but they\nalso report on a wide range of environmental issues, often with the help of\nremote sensing data. Their series on locations at risk for future Ebola\noutbreaks combined investigative reporting with original scientific research.\nThe articles uncovered how the fragmentation of forests around networks of\nvillages and towns in Equatorial Africa correlated with known outbreaks of\nEbola, and identified places where the disease may next spill over from\nwildlife to humans.\n\nMap of recent deforestation and forest edges in Nigeria. These two\ncharacteristics were affiliated with many of the known Ebola outbreaks. Image,\nScreenshot from the story: How We Used Machine Learning to Investigate Where\nEbola May Strike, by Caroline Chen, Al Shaw, and Irena Hwang. ProPublica.\nAugust 8, 2023\n\nThe series combined satellite data \u2013 long-term records of changing global\nforest cover and settlement maps \u2013 with pattern-finding algorithms,\ncalculations of forest fragmentation, cloud computing on Google Earth Engine,\nepidemiological models, consultation with scientists, and interviews with the\npeople of Meliandou, Guinea, who survived the worst Ebola outbreak in history.\nTheir conclusion is not just a warning for at-risk communities, but also a set\nof recommendations to reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks.\n\nMost of my examples have shown reporting in far-flung locales (at least from\nmy perspective in San Francisco\u2019s tech industry), which is one of the primary\nstrengths of satellite data. The data journalists at texty.org.ua, however,\nhad to deal directly with tragedy and trauma when Russia invaded Ukraine in\nearly 2022. They responded with some of the most detailed reporting on the\nimpact of the war I\u2019ve seen, despite working during blackouts and while\nsheltering from air raids.\n\nUkrainian reporters used the shape of shell craters in an irrigated field to\ndetermine the origin of the artillery fire. Image, Screenshot from the story:\nFrom Where and How is Russia Shelling Mykolaiv? by Denis Gubashov.\nTexty.org.ua. August 31, 2022\n\nTexty used multiple types of data to cover the war \u2013 including high resolution\ncommercial imagery, night lights data, and NASA fire locations. Combined, the\ndatasets give civilians whose lives have been upended by the invasion a means\nto investigate and respond to the tragedy in Ukraine that has been forced upon\nthem. The stories reflect their interests and priorities.\n\nThis series of maps shows cultivation of wheat (top), sunflower (middle), and\nmaize (bottom) from 2021\u201323 in both government controlled and Russian-occupied\nUkraine.

November 22,\n2023\n\n#### Approaches for Using Satellite Data in the Newsroom\n\nThe use of satellite data is rapidly increasing in journalism, a trend fueled\nby growing availability, higher quality, and the development of more usable\nanalysis tools. What does it take to successfully use this data to tell\nstories in a newsroom, and develop innovative reporting?\n\nTeamwork: It\u2019s difficult for a single reporter to have the wide range of\nskills necessary to fully exploit the potential of satellite data. Teams with\nexpertise in a range of fields \u2013 investigative reporting, writing, design,\nprogramming, and data analysis \u2013 are conducting the most novel and impactful\ndata journalism.\n\nOver the past 10 years satellite imagery has become an important component of\ndata journalism. In the next 10, it will likely evolve further.\n\nData literacy: Satellite data comes in many forms, suitable for a wide variety\nof applications. Knowing what data is available, and the strengths and\nweaknesses of each type, is essential for using it effectively.\n\nOutside experts: The field of remote sensing has thrived for over 50 years. In\nthat time scientists and technicians in government, academia, and industry\nhave developed techniques to derive insights from data. They\u2019re an invaluable\nresource for both background information and innovative new ideas.\n\nLocal knowledge: Data collected from a few hundred miles above the Earth\u2019s\nsurface is often limited when used in isolation. It is far more reliable when\ncombined with in-situ data, augmented by on-the ground reporting, and (perhaps\nmost importantly) informed by the perspective of the people who live in the\nareas being imaged.\n\nOver the past 10 years satellite imagery has become an important component of\ndata journalism. In the next 10, it will likely evolve further, from a tool\nused primarily to illustrate stories to one that is an integral part of\nresearch and investigative reporting. I\u2019m excited to see how reporters develop\ninnovative uses of existing datasets, and explore new types of data.\n\nThis story was originally published by Nightingale, the Journal of the Data\nVisualization Society.
