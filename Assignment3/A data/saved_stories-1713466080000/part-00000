In particular, they are a\nset of US government standards that specify which cryptographic algorithms\nallowed for use. There are many versions of FIPS, your code must be compliant\nat least with version 140-2\n\n### What changes should be done in an application\n\nIt depends on the FIPS revision, but the minimal change set includes:\n\n  * Remove the usage of non-approved cryptography. In most cases, this means removing MD5 and SHA-1.\n  * Replace Bouncy Castle jars like bcprov or bcpg with FIPS-compliant ones: bc-fips, bcpg-fips, and similar.\n\n### How to test these changes\n\nYou will need to have an environment where FIPS is enabled. In such an\nenvironment, the usage of non-compliant algorithms is prohibited, so the\napplication won't start up or will throw a runtime error. Therefore, extensive\ntesting of the changes will be needed.\n\nTo find an example of such an environment, you can look at the existing images\nwhere FIPS is enabled.\n\n### What about external services\n\nIt's not strictly required, but if you are planning to get FIPS certification,\nit will be necessary for all external services your application interacts with\nto be running in FIPS mode (e.g., Kafka, Cassandra, etc.).\n\n#fips #java #security\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
