Physicists graph everything. I did most of my plotting on\n> graph paper\u2013this continued through my second year of grad school\u2013and became\n> expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid\n> lines.\n>\n> In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed\n> everything I could. I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other\n> students were not making a lot of graphs. I discovered and absorbed the\n> principles of Cleveland\u2019s The Elements of Graphing Data.\n>\n> In grad school and beyond, I continued to use graphs in my research. But I\n> noticed a disconnect in how statisticians thought about graphics. There\n> seemed to be three perspectives:\n>\n> 1\\. The proponents of exploratory data analysis liked to graph raw data and\n> never think about models. I used their tools but was uncomfortable with the\n> gap between the graphs and the models, between exploration and analysis.\n>\n> 2\\. From the other direction, mainstream statisticians\u2013Bayesian and\n> otherwise\u2013did a lot of math and fit a lot of models (or, as my ascetic\n> Berkeley colleagues would say, applied a lot of procedures to data) but\n> rarely made a graph. They never seemed to care much about the fit of their\n> models to data.\n>\n> 3\\. Finally, textbooks and software manuals featured various conventional\n> graphs such as stem-and-leaf plots, residual plots, scatterplot matrices,\n> and q-q plots, all of which seemed appealing in the abstract but never did\n> much for me in the particular applications I was working on.\n>\n> In my article with Meng and Stern, and in Bayesian Data Analysis, and then\n> in my articles from 2003 and 2004, I have attempted to bring these\n> statistical perspectives together by framing exploratory graphics as model\n> checking: a statistical graph can reveal the unexpected, and \u201cthe\n> unexpected\u201d is defined relative to \u201cthe expected\u201d\u2013that is, a model. This\n> fits into my larger philosophy that puts model checking at the center of the\n> statistical enterprise.\n>\n> Meanwhile, my graphs have been slowly improving. I realized awhile ago that\n> I didn\u2019t need tables of numbers at all. And here and there I\u2019ve learned of\n> other ideas, for example Howard Wainer\u2019s practice of giving every graph a\n> title.\n\nI continued with some scattered thoughts about graphics and communication:\n\n> A statistical graph does not stand alone. It needs some words to go along\n> with it to explain it. . . . I realized that our plots, graphically strong\n> though they were, did not stand on their own. . . . This experience has led\n> me to want to put more effort into explaining every graph, not merely what\n> the points and lines are indicating (although that is important and can be\n> hard to figure out in many published graphs) but also what is the message\n> the graph is sending.\n>\n> Most graphs are nonlinear and don\u2019t have a natural ordering. A graph is not\n> a linear story or a movie you watch from beginning to end; rather, it\u2019s a\n> cluttered house which you can enter from any room. The perspective you pick\n> up if you start from the upstairs bathroom is much different than what you\n> get by going through the living room\u2013or, in graphical terms, you can look at\n> clusters of points and lines, you can look at outliers, you can make lots of\n> different comparisons. That\u2019s fine but if a graph is part of a scientific or\n> journalistic argument it can help to guide the reader a bit\u2013just as is done\n> automatically in the structuring of words in an article. . . .\n>\n> While all this was happening, I also was learning more about decision\n> analysis. In particular, Dave Krantz convinced me that the central unit of\n> decision analysis is not the utility function or even the decision tree but\n> rather the goal.\n>\n> Applying this idea to the present discussion: what is the goal of a graph?\n> There can be several, and there\u2019s no reason to suppose that the graph that\n> is best for achieving one of these goals will be optimal, or even good, for\n> another. . . .\n>\n> I\u2019m a statistician who loves graphs and uses them all the time, I\u2019m\n> continually working on improving my graphical presentation of data and of\n> inferences, but I\u2019m probably stuck (without realizing it) in a bit of a rut\n> of dotplots and lineplots. I\u2019m aware of an infographics community . . .\n>\n> Here\u2019s an example of where I\u2019m coming from: a blog post entitled, \u201cIs the\n> internet causing half the rapes in Norway? I wanna see the scatterplot.\u201d To\n> me, visualization is not an adornment or a way of promoting social science.\n> Visualization is a central tool in social science research. (I\u2019m not saying\n> visualization is strictly necessary\u2013I\u2019m sure you can do a lot of good work\n> with no visual sense at all\u2013but I think it\u2019s a powerful approach, and I\n> worry about people who believe social science claims that they can\u2019t\n> visualize. I worry about researchers who believe their own claims without\n> understanding them well enough to visualize the relation of these claims to\n> the data from which they are derived.)\n\nThe rest of my post from 2011 discusses my struggles in communicating with the\ninformation visualization community\u2013these are people who produce graphs for\ncommunication with general audiences, which motivates different goals and\ntools than those used by statisticians to communicate as part of the research\nprocess. Antony Unwin and I wrote a paper about these differences which was\nultimately published with discussion in 2013 (and here is our rejoinder to the\ndiscussions).\n\nLooking at all this a decade later, I\u2019m not so interested in non-statistical\ninformation visualization anymore. I don\u2019t mean this in a disparaging way! I\nthink infofiz is great. Sometimes the very aspects of an infographic that make\nit difficult to read and deficient from a purely statistical perspective are a\nbenefit for communication in that they can push the reader into thinking in\nnew ways; here\u2019s an example we discussed from a few years ago.\n\nI continue to favor what we call the click-through solution: Start with the\ninfographic, click to get more focused statistical graphics, click again to\nget the data and sources. But, in any case, the whole stat graphics vs.\ninfographics thing has gone away, I guess because it\u2019s clear that they can\ncoexist; I don\u2019t really see them as competing.\n\nWhassup now?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, my graphical practices have remained essentially\nunchanged since 2011. I say \u201cperhaps surprisingly,\u201d because other aspects of\nmy statistical workflow have changed a lot during this period. My lack of\ngraphical progress is probably a bad thing!\n\nA big reason for my stasis in this regard, I think, is that I\u2019ve worked on\nrelatively few large applied projects during the past fifteen years.\n\nFrom 2004 through 2008, my collaborators and I were working every day on Red\nState Blue State. We produced hundreds of graphs and the equivalent of\nsomething like 10 or 20 research articles. In addition to our statistical\ngoals of understanding our data and how they related to public opinion and\nvoting, we knew from the start that we wanted to communicate both to political\nscientists and to the general public, so we were on the lookout for new ways\nto display our data and inferences. Indeed, we had the idea for the superplot\nbefore we ever made the actual graph.\n\nSince 2008, I\u2019ve done lots of small applied analyses for books and various\nresearch projects, but no big project requiring a rethinking of how to make\ngraphs. The closest thing would be Stan, and here we have made some new\ndisplays\u2013at least, new to me\u2013but that work was done by collaborators such as\nJonah Gabry, who did ShinyStan, and this hasn\u2019t directly affected the sorts of\ngraphs that I make.\n\nI continue to think about graphs in new ways (for example, causal quartets and\nthe ladder of abstraction), but, as can be seen in those new papers, the looks\nof my graphs haven\u2019t really changed since 2011.\n\nThis entry was posted in Statistical Graphics by Andrew.
