Here's how I did it and the technology stack I used.\n\n### Simplicity is productivity\n\nYes, simpler code leads to a better final product and quicker shipping.\n\nBeing simple involves choosing technologies that streamline your workflow,\neven if it means giving up others that could complicate your coding process.\n\n### Design your Database first\n\nThe most important thing when creating software is designing your database.\nBegin by spending a significant portion of your time considering the features\nyour product will have.\n\nCreate a solid foundation and refine your database as much as possible before\nyou start coding. While making changes to your database will be inevitable,\nthe fewer changes you make, the faster you can launch your project.\n\n### JavaScript & Create React APP\n\nUsing Create React App with JavaScript sped up my development. While\nTypeScript could be beneficial in a larger team setting, for solo work\ncreating simple and reusable components is more than enough. Just keep your\ncomponents small.\n\nRemember, you can always refactor your code as your project grows.\nAdditionally, many TypeScript users often resort to using the any keyword to\nbypass persistent errors, which essentially defeats the purpose of TypeScript.\n\n### PHP & Laravel\n\nEveryone here might be surprised, but PHP, especially version 8.3, is really\nfast and simple to use. Laravel eliminates a lot of unnecessary work for me.\n\nWhat about Python, GO, Rust, or Java?\n\nPython is a great option, and with Django, you can easily replace Laravel. GO,\nRust, and Java don't offer many ready-to-use solutions. In most cases, you\nneed to code a lot of things yourself, and if you don't, these languages are\nmuch more complicated than PHP or Python.\n\nAnd what about scalability?\n\nGo, Rust, and Java can be scalable, but remember, you haven't made any money\nyet, and you might be trying to fix problems that may never even arise.\n\n### CSS Framework\n\nNo, I didn't write the CSS myself. In the admin panel, I use Material UI, and\non the frontend, I am using Bootstrap. The application may look a bit simple,\nbut with a few tweaks to the theme.js of Material UI, it can look much better.\nWhy spend hours designing when you can remove thousands of lines of code with\none npm install?\n\n### Docker\n\nYes, I have used Docker. Docker might seem complex initially, but I have\ncreated several boilerplate Dockerfiles for PHP, React, and NGINX, which I\nreuse in all my projects. These Dockefiles simplify the deployment process\nsignificantly, making it 10 times easier. You can deploy to any server\nenvironment with just one command: docker compose up --build.\n\n### Deployment\n\nThe only complex tool eatlink.gr uses is Kubernetes. However, I have deployed\nmy cluster on Vultr instead of AWS. Vultr is much more straightforward and\neliminates many layers of abstraction. You can deploy a K8S cluster in just a\nfew minutes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLaunching a startup like eatlink.gr quickly while managing multiple projects\nis possible with the right technologies. Using simple, productive technologies\nlike JavaScript with Create React App, PHP with Laravel, and efficient CSS\nframeworks helps streamline development.\n\nAdditionally, tools like Docker and Kubernetes, particularly on platforms like\nVultr, simplify deployment and scalability. The key is to start simple, select\nthe right tools, and scale as needed. This strategy saves time, conserves\nresources, and enables quick adaptation to market changes.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you found this article helpful.
