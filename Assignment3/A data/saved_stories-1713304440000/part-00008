This new 300-page\ninstallment covers the rise of Arabia and the role of \u201cOrientals\u201d in crafting\nthe culture we have today. In Gonick\u2019s hands history is a hoot, and very much\nabout ideas. I particularly savor this latest volume because by moving the\ncenter of the universe somewhere east of Europe \u2014 delving into Islam, Africa\nand East Asia \u2014 Gonick\u2019s cartoons can remedy the ignorance and arrogance of\nthe west.

The book is categorized into five options on extending one\u2019s\nlife: Elixirs, Meeting Immortals, Visiting Magical Places, Patience, and The\nFuture.\n\nStarting with a look at historical figures such as Gilgamesh\u2019s search for\nyouth-restoring seaweed and Qin She Huang\u2019s hunt for a fruit which grants\neternal life, the book touches on the unsuccessful search for mythical life-\nextending tools like alchemical elixirs, the philosopher\u2019s stone, and the\nflesh of the ningyo fish. The folkloric Moon rabbit is shown is vibrant\nyellow, stirring its cauldron of the Elixir Of Life.\n\nThe journey continues to mythical places where some form of a fountain of\nyouth supposedly exists in Bimini, St. Brendan\u2019s Island, and Tir Na Nog. A\ndynamic full-page illustration of a maiden soaking in a mountain stream in\nbold aquamarine evokes an idyllic atmosphere. Real-life places such as those\nin Earth\u2019s Blue Zones occurring in Sardinia, Okinawa, and Loma Linda,\nCalifornia, where inhabitants regularly live to upwards of 90 years, are also\ninvestigated.\n\nVenturing into the realms of biology and other sciences, long lived animals\nsuch as naked mole rats, planarian worms, and a jellyfish known as turritopsis\ndohrnii are described. A gene that centenarians may possess known as FoxO is\nexamined. Healthy routines like eating well, regular exercise, and flossing\nare suggested. A humorous full-page illustration of famous literary immortals\nis shown, featuring amazons, wizards, Pinocchio, and Dracula.\n\nEnding the book with options that might exist in the future, cryogenics,\nmummification, cloning, and inserting one\u2019s consciousness into a digital\navatar are all represented. The theory of biomechanical immortality is vividly\nillustrated in emerald green with an enormous robot having its puny human\nbrain installed as pleased scientists look on. Finally, the belief in an\nafterlife in world religions is presented.\n\nA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Immortality is a lively, quick read, exploring concepts\nin history, science, literature, and geography, and presented in an easily\ndigested manner. Charmingly illustrated in a blocky, comic book style, with\nchunky images of futuristic robots with glowing brains, medieval alchemists\nmixing strange chemicals, and Ponce De Leon wielding a metal detector, it\u2019s an\ninformative, humorous book.\n\n\u2013 SD\n\n#### GOLDFISH GHOST DOES NOT BEGIN WITH THE DEATH OF A FISH. IT BEGINS WITH\nTHE BIRTH OF A GHOST.\n\nGoldfish Ghost by Lemony Snicket, Lisa Brown (Illustrator) oaring Brook Press\n2017, 40 pages, 8.4 x 10.4 inches, Hardcover\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nGoldfish Ghost does not begin with the death of a fish. It begins with the\nbirth of a ghost. The wonderfully clever, silly, sweet story about a ghost in\nsearch of good company comes from husband and wife team Lemony Snicket and\nLisa Brown.\n\nThough the story is great, it\u2019s the little details in Brown\u2019s illustrations\nthat make me love this book. Goldfish Ghost (and the ghosts of the sea\ncreatures he meets) floats through the story belly-up. Tucked into the beach\nscene is pair of people ghosts, watching the waves in old-timey bathing suits.\nThe subtle way in which Brown uses scrawled, faint, white line\u2014ghost-like in\nits own right, like the chalked words erased from a blackboard but not really\ngone\u2014is so lovely and smart, it\u2019s probably my favorite thing about the whole\nbook.\n\n\u2013 Mk Smith Despres\n\n#### KEVIN KELLY SITES\n\n  * Lifestream\n  * The Technium\n  * True Films\n  * Extrapolations\n  * Screen Pub\n  * Quantified Self\n  * New Rules\n  * Street Use\n  * Asia Grace\n  * Silver Cord\n  * Wink\n\nCreative Commons\n\nApril 2024M| T| W| T| F| S| S  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7  \n8| 9| 10| 11| 12| 13| 14  \n15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20| 21  \n22| 23| 24| 25| 26| 27| 28  \n29| 30  \n  \nBy continuing to use this site you acknowledge that you accept our cookie\npolicy and terms of use.
