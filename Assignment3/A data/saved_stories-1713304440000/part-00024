A 16 megabyte L3 cache is shared\nbetween all four cores.\n\nThe device runs at between 2.3GHz and 2.5GHz, includes a pair of 72-bit\nDDR4-3200 controllers, and consumes 35 watts when running at 2.5GHz.\n\nThe processor runs Loongson's own LoongArch instruction system, a RISC ISA\nthat blends ideas from MIPS and RISC-V.\n\nLoongArch is arguably China's most advanced locally developed instruction set.\nIts matching software ecosystem is also decently developed, with a cut of\nLinux dubbed LoongOS already available and big-in-China apps ported to the\nplatform.\n\nThe QQ post states that the PCs will run the Unity OS \u2013 a cut of Debian\nfavoured in China \u2013 and WPS Office, which is a productivity suite created by\nChinese developer Kingsoft. A classroom management platform is also present,\nas is a management platform allowing the City of Hebi to manage the PC fleet.\n\n  * French cloud Scaleway starts renting Alibaba's RISC-V SoC\n  * Alibaba's research arm promises server-class RISC-V processor due this year\n  * India\u2019s homebrew RISC-V CPU goes on sale in new development board\n  * Welcome to the splinternet \u2013 where freedom of expression is suppressed and repressed, and Big Brother is watching\n\nLoongson's post reveals that it will use the Hebi implementation to promote\nits offerings to other users around China.\n\nWhich is where things get interesting. Chinese state media last year counted\n518,000 schools around China, attended by 195 million students and served by\n18.8 million teachers.\n\nAnnual PC shipments for the entire world reached 241.8 million in 2023,\naccording to analyst firm Gartner.\n\nWith Beijing increasingly keen on replacing Western tech with local products,\nmass implementation at Chinese schools could account for a year's worth of PC\nshipments at current purchasing rates.\n\nLet's imagine that China makes that happen in five years \u2013 it would\neffectively render a fifth of the PC market unavailable to Microsoft, AMD,\nIntel, and Qualcomm.\n\nNow ask yourself whether whoever it is tending your retirement savings knows\nthat could happen.\n\nIf you're curious to know more about the 3A5000, AliExpress offers plenty of\nlaptops, desktops, and motherboards powered by the processor. They're not\ncheap, but vendors have hundreds of them ready to dispatch. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Loongson\n  * PC\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Loongson\n  * PC\n  * RISC-V\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * Jupiter Ace\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * SiFive\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n  * workstation\n  * ZX Spectrum\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Computer\n  * CPU\n  * RISC\n  * Semiconductor\n\n#### More about\n\n30 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Loongson\n  * PC\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Loongson\n  * PC\n  * RISC-V\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * Jupiter Ace\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * SiFive\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n  * workstation\n  * ZX Spectrum\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Computer\n  * CPU\n  * RISC\n  * Semiconductor\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Loongson CPU that performs like 2020 Core i3 makes its way to Chinese\nmini PCs\n\nSlow but bona fide made in China\n\nPersonal Tech3 days | 71\n\n#### US senator wants to put the brakes on Chinese EVs\n\nFears of low-cost invasion and data spies spark call for ban\n\nSecurity1 day | 37\n\n#### Intel preps export-friendly lower-power Gaudi 3 AI chips for China\n\nBeijing will be thrilled by this nerfed silicon\n\nAI + ML4 days | 5\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### SiFive is back with another 64-bit RISC-V dev board \u2013 hopefully\n\nDitching Intel for a system-on-chip out of Beijing\n\nOn-Prem7 days | 6\n\n#### Imagination licenses RISC-V CPU cores for smart TVs, IoT, embedded stuff\n\nChip designer legging it after Arm\n\nEdge + IoT8 days | 14\n\n#### China orders its telcos to rip and replace US chips with homegrown\nsilicon by 2027\n\nThere's no Huawei we saw that coming\n\nNetworks3 days | 70\n\n#### PC shipments up for first quarter thanks to AI, say analysts\n\nVendors rub hands at prospect of higher sales for pricier kit\n\nPersonal Tech7 days | 6\n\n#### Where there's a will, there's Huawei to develop one's own chipmaking kit\n\nExport restrictions and sanctions working well, we see\n\nSystems5 days | 25\n\n#### Microsoft warns that China is using AI to stir the pot ahead of US\nelection\n\nBeware random inflammatory questions on social media \u2013 they may come from a\nthreat actor\n\nAI + ML11 days | 89\n\n#### Microsoft brings World of Warcraft and other Blizzard titles back to\nChina\n\nBattle with NetEase ends, peace deal will see games cross the Great Firewall -\nin both directions\n\nSoftware6 days | 6\n\n#### US lawmakers rage over Intel Meteor Lake-powered Huawei PC\n\nSpecial export license granted to Intel by President Trump unlikely to be\nrenewed\n\nSystems23 hrs | 7\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
