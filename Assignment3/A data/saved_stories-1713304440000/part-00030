Russians are justifiably proud of their\ncountry's heritage of space firsts and dominant position in spaceflight. So\ntypically, officials bluster.\n\nThis is what Roscosmos chief Yuri Borisov did recently during a lecture at the\nTsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics. Located south of\nMoscow, this is the world's first museum devoted solely to spaceflight.\nBorisov heads the country's main space corporation, and thus is the leader of\nthe country's space activities.\n\nBorisov was speaking about the country's future launch plans to a group of\nstudents, cadets, and visitors at the museum. During his remarks, he noted\nthat SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket could be used about 10 times. Borisov said\nRussia's new Amur-CNG rocket would be capable of much more.\n\n\u201cIf the Falcon 9, as a rule, is used more than 10 times, our new methalox\nfirst stage will be reusable at least 50 and perhaps up to 100 times,\" Borisov\nsaid. \"That alone will pay for its development cost.\" His remarks were\nreported by the state-operated TASS news service and translated for Ars by Rob\nMitchell.\n\n## Playing to an audience\n\nThis clearly was a message intended to placate an audience that must be\nwondering why SpaceX has launched three dozen rockets so far in 2024, whereas\nRussia has mustered just half a dozen. However, Borisov's claims fall well\nshort of reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than 10 launches of a first stage, SpaceX in fact just flew a Falcon 9\nrocket for the 20th time. Russia has never reused a rocket's first stage.\n\nAs for the Amur-CNG rocket, with the CNG standing for its propellant\ncompressed natural gas, this remains a paper rocket. Russia has been talking\npublicly about this booster for four years now, saying it would be capable of\nlofting 10.5 metric tons to low-Earth orbit for just $22 million. This would\noffer a competitive alternative to the Falcon 9\u2014if it existed.\n\nHowever, it does not. Back in 2020, Russian officials said Amur would debut in\n2026. Recently, however, Borisov indicated that its debut would slip to 2028\nor 2029. Anyone who follows the launch industry will well know what that\nmeans. Amur hardware does not exist, and all plans regarding its development\nare notional. It may well never exist.\n\nEven assuming a debut by something like 2030, recall that it took SpaceX more\nthan five years after the debut of the Falcon 9 to land a first stage rocket\nsuccessfully. It took another five years for the company, which is known for\nmoving fast, to begin reusing first stages frequently. Finally, it took 14\nyears for the first Falcon 9 rocket to be flown 20 times. So if Russia debuts\nthe Amur vehicle in the next five years, we might, under the best of\ncircumstances, expect Roscosmos to fly a stage 20 times by the mid-2040s.\n\n## The Angara experience\n\nThere is another reason to have serious doubts about the development of Amur,\nespecially as Russia devotes much of its resources to fighting a war against\nUkraine. (Indeed, it appears that Russia is recruiting soldiers for the war\nfrom Roscosmos). This is because of the experience with the Angara rocket.\n\nShortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Russian government approved\nthe development of the Angara rocket in 1992. The first test flight did not\nhappen until 2014, and as of earlier this month, it was still conducting test\nflights rather than carrying meaningful payloads into orbit.\n\nSo if it took Roscosmos three decades to design, build, and test the Angara\nrocket, which is fairly conventional, how long might it take to develop the\nmore innovative Amur vehicle with a capacity for vertical landings and reuse?\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n112\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
