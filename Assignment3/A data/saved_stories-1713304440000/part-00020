But for the new research, the\nscientists looked beyond the island's caves to explore several open-air\ndeposits scattered across Barrow Island.\n\nRelated: Lost 'Atlantis' continent off Australia may have been home for half a\nmillion humans 70,000 years ago\n\nResearchers found more than 4,000 stone artifacts on Barrow Island, indicating\nthat it was an Aboriginal hotspot during the last ice age. (Image credit:\nSuzanne Long / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nOver three years, they examined 4,400 slicing, cutting and grinding tools from\na mix of sites. What surprised the researchers was the variety in the\nartifacts' compositions. Most of the tools found in caves were fashioned out\nof limestone, the most abundant geological material on the island. Those\ndiscovered at the open-air sites, by contrast, were made mostly from rocks,\nincluding igneous and sandstone, that matched sources on mainland Australia.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe findings show \"a surprising amount of diversity in stone tool composition\nover a relatively small area,\" said Tiina Manne, an archaeologist at The\nUniversity of Queensland in Australia who was not involved in the research.\n\nThis diversity is significant because it reveals details about the people who\nfrequented Barrow Island, Zeanah said.\n\nBarrow Island (outlined in red) is a 78-square-mile (202 square kilometers)\nterritory about 37 miles (60 km) off Australia's northwest coast. (Image\ncredit: Google Maps)\n\n\"The open sites provide clear links to the mainland geologies, and that infers\nthat people were using the coastal plain that's underwater now,\" Zeanah said.\nAn example he found particularly intriguing was the roundish, flat grinding\nstones that are derived from geological sources beyond Barrow Island. The team\ndiscovered that these stones were water-worn, suggesting that before they were\ncrafted into grinding tools, they had been hand-selected from stream beds or\ntidal regions, perhaps from coastal flats or rivers that may have run across\nthe exposed plain that once connected Barrow Island to mainland Australia when\nsea levels were low.\n\nThe indication that many of the island's tools came from far-flung locations\nis exciting, Zeanah said, as it suggests that the ancient exposed plain may\nhave been a thoroughfare for trade and exchange between different groups.\n\n\"This was probably not like a single group of people moving seasonally across\nthe plains,\" Zeanah said. \"The area is vast. The materials may have been\ntransmitted by trade, or by Aboriginal people going from group to group. So\nthat implies a social network.\"\n\nThe presence of those grinding stones on Barrow Island supports the idea that\nmass movement and knowledge sharing unfolded for thousands of years across\nthis landscape, the study authors said.\n\n\"What that suggests to us is that people knew that there wasn't good stone on\nBarrow Island, and they often brought cobbles to provision the landscape\nthere, so that they could revisit in the future,\" Zeanah said. \"That shows a\nlot of logistics, foresight and knowing the landscape well, I believe.\"\n\nThe researchers are unsure why the geological makeup of the cave tools differs\nfrom those found outside. The most likely explanation is that artifacts made\nof limestone do not survive exposure on the surface as well as artifacts made\nof harder stone from the mainland. Another possibility has to do with how sea\nlevels rose as the ice age declined, which would have gradually severed Barrow\nIsland from the mainland and constricted the movement of people across the\nplain. In Boodie Cave, only a handful of unearthed tools were made of rocks\nthat originated elsewhere. And in the protected cave environment, it has been\npossible to show that those tools tend to be older, and therefore may have\nbeen deposited earlier, when sea levels were at their lowest.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that these remote tools were brought to the site by\ngroups that could move freely between Barrow Island and the mainland.\nLimestone tools were used more intensively when rising sea levels began to\ncut-off the island from the mainland, the study authors said. This separation\nwould have driven the islands' inhabitants to settle in caves and rely on the\nabundant local limestone to make the tools, the researchers suggested.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014When did Australia become a continent?\n\n\u2014Scientists finally discover 'lost continent' thought to have vanished without\na trace\n\n\u20141st Americans had Indigenous Australian genes\n\nThalanyji people, representatives of whom co-authored the study with Zeanah\nand colleagues, note there are oral histories about the islands on their sea\ncountry. Zeanah hopes this new research will help to highlight these ancient\nconnections.\n\nThe study is \"absolutely unique in Australia,\" Manne said. \"It provides a\nrecord of coastal and hinterland desert landscape use by Aboriginal peoples\nduring a time period that is virtually unknown from elsewhere on the continent\n\u2014 because other similar coastal-hinterland areas now lie drowned beneath the\nsea.\"\n\nEmma Bryce\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nEmma Bryce is a London-based freelance journalist who writes primarily about\nthe environment, conservation and climate change.
