Many legends surround\nher ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the\ncity, Odaenathus. Her husband became king in 260, elevating Palmyra to supreme\npower in the Near East by defeating the Sasanian Empire of Persia and\nstabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia became\nthe regent of her son Vaballathus and held de facto power throughout his\nreign.\n\nIn 270, Zenobia launched an invasion that brought most of the Roman East under\nher sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid-271 her realm\nextended from Ancyra, central Anatolia, to Upper Egypt, although she remained\nnominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to the campaign of the\nRoman emperor Aurelian in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed\nthe title of empress, thus declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome. The Romans\nwere victorious after heavy fighting; the empress was besieged in her capital\nand captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome, where she spent the\nremainder of her life.\n\nZenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her\ncourt, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward\nher subjects and protected religious minorities. The empress maintained a\nstable administration, which governed a multicultural, multiethnic empire.\nZenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her\nrise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a\npatriotic symbol in Syria.\n\n## Name, appearance and sources[edit]\n\nZenobia was born c. 240\u2013241,^[1] and bore the gentilicium (surname)\nSeptimia.^[note 1]^[4] Her native Palmyrene name was Bat-Zabbai (written\n\"Btzby\" in the Palmyrene alphabet),^[5] an Aramaic name meaning \"daughter of\nZabbai\".^[6] Such compound names for women were common in Palmyra, where the\nelement \"bt\" means daughter, but the personal name that follows does not\nnecessarily denote the immediate father, rather referring to the ancestor of\nthe family.^[7] In Greek\u2014Palmyra's diplomatic and second language, used in\nmany Palmyrene inscriptions\u2014she used the name Zenobia.^[8] In Palmyra, when\nwritten in Greek, names such as Zabeida, Zabdila, Zabbai or Zabda were often\ntransformed into \"Zenobios\" (masculine) and \"Zenobia\" (feminine).^[9] The\nelement \"Zabbai\" from Zenobia's native name means \"gift of N.N. [god]\",^[note\n2]^[12] and the name Zenobia translates to \"one whose life derives from\nZeus\".^[8] The historian Victor Duruy believed that the queen used the Greek\nname as a translation of her native name, in deference to her Greek\nsubjects.^[13] The philologist Wilhelm Dittenberger argued that the name Bat-\nZabbai underwent a detortum (twist), thus resulting in the name Zenobia.^[14]\n\nThe ninth-century historian al-Tabari, in his highly fictionalized\naccount,^[15] wrote that the queen's name was Na'ila al-Zabba'.^[16]\nManichaean sources, reporting the visit of the apostle Addai to the region\nduring the time of Odaenathus, called Zenobia \"Queen Tadi\", wife of kysr\n(caesar).^[note 3] The name given to Zenobia in those Manichaean writings\nseems to derive from Tadmor, Palmyra's native name, and this is supported by\nthe Coptic Acts Codex, where Zenobia is named Queen Thadmor.^[18]\n\nNo contemporary statues of Zenobia have been found in Palmyra or elsewhere,\nonly inscriptions on statues bases survive, indicating that a statue of the\nqueen once stood in the place; most known representations of Zenobia are the\nidealized portraits of her found on her coins.^[19] Sculptures of Palmyrene\nstyle were normally impersonal, unlike Greek and Roman ones: a statue of\nZenobia in this style would have given an idea of her general style in dress\nand jewelry but would not have revealed her true appearance.^[19] The non-\ncontemporary historian Edward Gibbon has described her as being \u201cof a dark\ncomplexion\u201d and considered \u201cmost lovely,\u201d and that she \u201cequalled in beauty her\n[claimed] ancestor Cleopatra.\u201d^[20] British scholar William Wright visited\nPalmyra toward the end of the nineteenth century in a vain search for a\nsculpture of the queen.^[21]\n\nIn addition to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life was recorded in\ndifferent ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the Historia\nAugusta, a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit\nunreliable) source for the era.^[22] The author (or authors) of the Historia\nAugusta invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia in the absence\nof contemporary sources.^[22] Some Historia Augusta accounts are corroborated\nfrom other sources, and are more credible.^[22] The Byzantine chronicler\nJoannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of\nZenobia.^[22]\n\n## Origin, family and early life[edit]\n\nPalmyrene society was an amalgam of Semitic-speaking peoples, mostly Arabs and\nArameans, and Zenobia cannot be identified with any one group; as a Palmyrene,\nshe may have had both Arab and Aramean ancestry.^[23] Information about\nZenobia's ancestry and immediate family connections is scarce and\ncontradictory.^[24] Nothing is known about her mother, and her father's\nidentity is debated.^[25] Manichaean sources mention a \"Nafsha\", sister of the\n\"queen of Palmyra\",^[25] but those sources are confused and \"Nafsha\" may refer\nto Zenobia herself:^[26] it is doubtful that Zenobia had a sister.^[27]\n\nApparently not a commoner,^[28] Zenobia would have received an education\nappropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl.^[29] The Historia Augusta contains\ndetails of her early life, although their veracity is dubious; according to\nthe Historia Augusta, the queen's hobby as a child was hunting^[28] and, in\naddition to her Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, she was fluent in Egyptian\nand Greek and spoke Latin.^[30]^[31] When she was about fourteen years old\n(ca. 255), Zenobia became the second wife of Odaenathus, the ras (\"lord\") of\nPalmyra.^[28]^[25] Noble families in Palmyra often intermarried, and it is\nprobable that Zenobia and Odaenathus shared some ancestors.^[14]\n\n### Contemporary epigraphical evidence[edit]\n\nBasing their suppositions upon archaeological evidence, various historians\nhave suggested several men as Zenobia's father:\n\nInscription at Palmyra honoring Julius Aurelius Zenobius, believed by some to\nbe Zenobia's father\n\nJulius Aurelius Zenobius appears on a Palmyrene inscription as a strategos of\nPalmyra in 231\u2013232; based on the similarity of the names,^[25] Zenobius was\nsuggested as Zenobia's father by the numismatist Alfred von Sallet and\nothers.^[32] The archaeologist William Waddington argued in favor of Zenobius'\nidentification as the father, assuming that his statue stood opposite to where\nthe statue of the queen stood in Great Colonnade. However, the linguist Jean-\nBaptiste Chabot pointed out that Zenobius' statue stood opposite to that of\nOdaenathus not Zenobia and rejected Waddington's hypothesis.^[14] The only\ngentilicium, a hereditary name borne by people that was originally the name of\none's gens (family or clan) by patrilineal descent, appearing on Zenobia's\ninscriptions was \"Septimia\" (not \"Julia Aurelia\", which she would have borne\nif her father's gentilicium was Aurelius),^[4] and it cannot be proven that\nthe queen changed her gentilicium to Septimia after her marriage.^[note\n4]^[25]^[32]\n\nOne of Zenobia's inscriptions recorded her as \"Septimia Bat-Zabbai, daughter\nof Antiochus\".^[34]^[35] Antiochus' identity is not definitively known:^[24]\nhis ancestry is not recorded in Palmyrene inscriptions, and the name was not\ncommon in Palmyra.^[36] This, combined with the meaning of Zenobia's Palmyrene\nname (daughter of Zabbai), led scholars such as Harald Ingholt to speculate\nthat Antiochus might have been a distant ancestor: the Seleucid king Antiochus\nIV Epiphanes or Antiochus VII Sidetes, whose wife was the Ptolemaic Cleopatra\nThea.^[34]^[36] In the historian Richard Stoneman's view, Zenobia would not\nhave created an obscure ancestry to connect herself with the ancient\nMacedonian rulers: if a fabricated ancestry were needed, a more direct\nconnection would have been invented.^[28] According to Stoneman, Zenobia \"had\nreason to believe [her Seleucid ancestry] to be true\".^[28] The historian\nPatricia Southern, noting that Antiochus was mentioned without a royal title\nor a hint of great lineage, believes that he was a direct ancestor or a\nrelative rather than a Seleucid king who lived three centuries before\nZenobia.^[36]\n\nOn the basis of Zenobia's Palmyrene name, Bat Zabbai, her father may have been\ncalled Zabbai; alternatively, Zabbai may have been the name of a more distant\nancestor.^[24] The historian Trevor Bryce suggests that she was related to\nSeptimius Zabbai, Palmyra's garrison leader, and he may even have been her\nfather.^[24] The archaeologist Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, attempting to\nreconcile the meaning of the name \"Bat Zabbai\" with the inscription mentioning\nthe queen as daughter of Antiochus, suggested that two brothers, Zabbai and\nAntiochus, existed, with a childless Zabbai dying and leaving his widow to\nmarry his brother Antiochus. Thus, since Zenobia was born out of a levirate\nmarriage, she was theoretically the daughter of Zabbai, hence the name.^[37]\n\n### Ancient sources[edit]\n\nIn the Historia Augusta, Zenobia is said to have been a descendant of\nCleopatra and claimed descent from the Ptolemies.^[note 5]^[9] According to\nthe Souda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia,^[38] after the Palmyrene\nconquest of Egypt,^[39] the sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a ten-volume\nhistory of Alexandria dedicated to Cleopatra.^[40] According to modern\nscholars, by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia.^[note 6]^[40]^[42] Apart from\nlegends, there is no direct evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a\ncontemporary conflation of Zenobia with Cleopatra.^[43] The connection may\nhave been invented by Zenobia's enemies to discredit her,^[note 7]^[45] but\ncircumstantial evidence indicates that Zenobia herself made the claim; an\nimperial declaration once ascribed to Emperor Severus Alexander (died 235) was\nprobably made by Zenobia in the name of her son Vaballathus, where the king\nnamed Alexandria \"my ancestral city\", which indicates a claim to Ptolemaic\nancestry.^[46]^[47] Zenobia's alleged claim of a connection to Cleopatra seems\nto have been politically motivated,^[23] since it would have given her a\nconnection with Egypt and made her a legitimate successor to the Ptolemies'\nthrone.^[48] A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is\nunlikely,^[49] and attempts by classical sources to trace the queen's ancestry\nto the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are apocryphal.^[50]\n\n#### Arab traditions and al-Zabba'[edit]\n\nAlthough some Arab historians linked Zenobia to the Queen of Sheba, their\naccounts are apocryphal.^[50] Medieval Arabic traditions identify a queen of\nPalmyra named al-Zabba',^[51] and her most romantic account comes from al-\nTabari.^[52] According to al-Tabari, she was an Amalekite; her father was 'Amr\nibn Zarib, an 'Am\u0101l\u012bq sheikh who was killed by the Tanukhids.^[50] Al-Tabari\nidentifies a sister of al-Zabba' as \"Zabibah\".^[50] Jadhimah ibn Malik, the\nTanukhid king who killed the queen's father, was killed by al-Zabba'.^[52]\nAccording to al-Tabari, al-Zabba' had a fortress along the Euphrates and ruled\nPalmyra.^[15]\n\nAl-Tabari's account does not mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or\nthe Sassanians;^[15] focusing on the tribes and their relations, it is\nimmersed in legends.^[53] Although the account is certainly based on the story\nof Zenobia,^[15] it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary\nnomadic Arab queen (or queens).^[54]^[53] Al-Zabba''s fortress was probably\nHalabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named\nZenobia.^[15]\n\n## Queen of Palmyra[edit]\n\n### Consort[edit]\n\nOdaenathus, a bust dated to the 250s\n\nDuring the early centuries AD, Palmyra was a city subordinate to Rome and part\nof the province of Syria Phoenice.^[55] In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian\nmarched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who had invaded the\nempire's eastern regions; Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa.^[56]\nOdaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian's\nson),^[57] was declared king of Palmyra.^[58] Launching successful campaigns\nagainst Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263.^[59]\nOdaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler.^[60] In addition\nto the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly\ncorrector totius orientis (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman\nterritories from the Black Sea to Palestine.^[61] In 267, when Zenobia was in\nher late twenties or early thirties, Odaenathus and his eldest son were\nassassinated while returning from a campaign.^[60]\n\nThe first inscription mentioning Zenobia as queen is dated two or three years\nafter Odaenathus' death, so exactly when Zenobia assumed the title \"queen of\nPalmyra\" is uncertain.^[62] However, she was probably designated as queen when\nher husband became king.^[62] As queen consort, Zenobia remained in the\nbackground and was not mentioned in the historical record.^[63] According to\nlater accounts, including one by Giovanni Boccaccio, she accompanied her\nhusband on his campaigns.^[64] If the accounts of her accompanying her husband\nare true, according to Southern, Zenobia would have boosted the morale of the\nsoldiers and gained political influence, which she needed in her later\ncareer.^[63]\n\n#### Possible role in Odaenathus' assassination[edit]\n\nAccording to the Historia Augusta, Odaenathus was assassinated by a cousin\nnamed Maeonius.^[65] In the Historia Augusta, Odaenathus' son from his first\nwife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father.^[66] The\nHistoria Augusta claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time\nbecause she did not accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own\nchildren).^[65] The Historia Augusta does not suggest that Zenobia was\ninvolved in the events leading to her husband's murder,^[67] and the crime is\nattributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy.^[65] This account,\naccording to the historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional.^[68]\nAlthough some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the\nassassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-\nRoman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the\nthrone.^[69]\n\n### Regent[edit]\n\nVaballathus, Zenobia's son and successor of his father Odaenathus (on the\nobverse of an antoninianus, AD 272)\n\nIn the Historia Augusta , Maeonius was emperor briefly before he was killed by\nhis soldiers,^[67] however, no inscriptions or evidence exist for his\nreign.^[70] At the time of Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia might have been\nwith her husband; according to chronicler George Syncellus, he was killed near\nHeraclea Pontica in Bithynia.^[71] The transfer of power seems to have been\nsmooth, since Syncellus reports that the time from the assassination to the\narmy handing the crown to Zenobia was one day.^[71] Zenobia may have been in\nPalmyra, but this would have reduced the likelihood of a smooth transition;\nthe soldiers might have chosen one of their officers, so the first scenario of\nher being with her husband is more likely.^[71] The historical records are\nunanimous that Zenobia did not fight for supremacy and there is no evidence of\ndelay in the transfer of the throne to Odaenathus and Zenobia's son, the ten-\nyear-old Vaballathus.^[72] Although she never claimed to rule in her own right\nand acted as a regent for her son,^[73] Zenobia held the reins of power in the\nkingdom,^[74] and Vaballathus was kept in his mother's shadow, never\nexercising real power.^[75]\n\n#### Consolidation of power[edit]\n\nThe Palmyrene monarchy was new; allegiance was based on loyalty to Odaenathus,\nmaking the transfer of power to a successor more difficult than it would have\nbeen in an established monarchy.^[76] Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty's\nfuture by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated.^[77]\nZenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its\nsubjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor\n(her son).^[77] Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed\nhis father's royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription\nrecords him as King of Kings.^[77]^[72]\n\nRoman regions under Odaenathus (yellow) and the Palmyrene kingdom (green)\n\nOdaenathus controlled a large area of the Roman East,^[note 8] and held the\nhighest political and military authority in the region, superseding that of\nthe Roman provincial governors.^[79]^[60] His self-created status was\nformalized by Emperor Gallienus,^[80] who had little choice but to\nacquiesce.^[81] Odaenathus's power relative to that of the emperor and the\ncentral authority was unprecedented and elastic, but relations remained smooth\nuntil his death.^[82] His assassination meant that the Palmyrene rulers'\nauthority and position had to be clarified, which led to a conflict over their\ninterpretation.^[82] The Roman court viewed Odaenathus as an appointed Roman\nofficial who derived his power from the emperor, but the Palmyrene court saw\nhis position as hereditary.^[82] This conflict was the first step on the road\nto war between Rome and Palmyra.^[82]\n\nOdaenathus' Roman titles, such as dux Romanorum, corrector totius orientis and\nimperator totius orientis differed from his royal eastern ones because the\nRoman ranks were not hereditary.^[83] Vaballathus had a legitimate claim to\nhis royal titles, but had no right to the Roman ones\u2014especially corrector\n(denoting a senior military and provincial commander in the Roman system),\nwhich Zenobia used for her son in his earliest known inscriptions with \"King\nof Kings\".^[77] Although the Roman emperors accepted the royal succession, the\nassumption of Roman military rank antagonized the empire.^[84] Emperor\nGallienus may have decided to intervene in an attempt to regain central\nauthority;^[35] according to the Historia Augusta, praetorian prefect Aurelius\nHeraclianus was dispatched to assert imperial authority over the east and was\nrepelled by the Palmyrene army.^[85] The account is doubtful, however, since\nHeraclianus participated in Gallienus' assassination in 268.^[86] Odaenathus\nwas assassinated shortly before the emperor, and Heraclianus would have been\nunable to be sent to the East, fight the Palmyrenes and return to the West in\ntime to become involved in the conspiracy against the emperor.^[note 9]^[86]\n\n#### Early reign[edit]\n\nThe citadel of Halabiye, renamed \"Zenobia\" after its renovation by the queen\n\nThe extent of Zenobia's territorial control during her early reign is debated;\naccording to the historian Fergus Millar, her authority was confined to\nPalmyra and Emesa until 270.^[note 10]^[88] If this was the case, the events\nof 270 (which saw Zenobia's conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are\nextraordinary.^[87] It is more likely that the queen ruled the territories\ncontrolled by her late husband,^[87] a view supported by Southern and the\nhistorian Udo Hartmann,^[89] and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman\nhistorian Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband's\npower).^[87] The Historia Augusta also mentioned that Zenobia took control of\nthe East during Gallienus' reign.^[87]^[89] Further evidence of extended\nterritorial control was a statement by the Byzantine historian Zosimus, who\nwrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.^[note 11]^[87]\n\nThere is no recorded unrest against the queen accompanying her ascendance in\nancient sources hostile to her, indicating no serious opposition to the new\nregime.^[note 12]^[91] The most obvious candidates for opposition were the\nRoman provincial governors, but the sources do not say that Zenobia marched on\nany of them or that they tried to remove her from the throne.^[92] According\nto Hartmann, the governors and military leaders of the eastern provinces\napparently acknowledged and supported Vaballathus as the successor of\nOdaenathus.^[92] During Zenobia's early regency, she focused on safeguarding\nthe borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran.^[93] To protect\nthe Persian borders, the queen fortified many settlements on the Euphrates\n(including the citadels of Halabiye\u2014later called Zenobia\u2014and Zalabiye).^[94]\nCircumstantial evidence exists for confrontations with the Sassanid Persians;\nprobably in 269, Vaballathus assumed the victory title of Persicus Maximus\n(the great victor in Persia); this may be connected to an unrecorded battle\nagainst a Persian army trying to control northern Mesopotamia.^[note\n13]^[95]^[96]\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\nIn 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was defending the\nborders of Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was\ncementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between\nloyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance.^[97]\nThe timing and rationale of the queen's decision to use military force to\nstrengthen her authority in the East is unclear;^[97] scholar Gary K. Young\nsuggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and\nZenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance.^[98]\nAnother factor may have been the weakness of Roman central authority and its\ncorresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced\nZenobia that the only way to maintain stability in the East was to control the\nregion directly.^[98] The historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to\nher desire to protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by\nRome's failure to protect the provinces.^[99] Also, according to Schwartz, the\neconomic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would\nhave otherwise passed through Palmyra.^[100] The Tanukhids near Bostra and the\nmerchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene\ndomination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.^[100]\n\n##### Syria and the invasion of Arabia Petraea[edit]\n\nBostra, sacked by Palmyra in 270\n\nIn the spring of 270, while Claudius was fighting the Goths in the mountains\nof Thrace, Zenobia sent her general Septimius Zabdas to Bosra (capital of the\nprovince of Arabia Petraea);^[97] the queen's timing seems intentional.^[101]\nIn Arabia the Roman governor (dux), Trassus (commanding the Legio III\nCyrenaica),^[note 14] confronted the Palmyrenes and was routed and\nkilled.^[97] Zabdas sacked the city, and destroyed the temple of Zeus Hammon,\nthe legion's revered shrine.^[97] A Latin inscription after the fall of\nZenobia attests to its destruction:^[103] \"The temple of Iuppiter Hammon,\ndestroyed by the Palmyrene enemies, which ... rebuilt, with a silver statue\nand iron doors (?)\".^[104] The city of Umm el-Jimal may have also been\ndestroyed by the Palmyrenes in connection with their efforts to subjugate the\nTanukhids.^[103]\n\nAfter his victory, Zabdas marched south along the Jordan Valley and apparently\nmet little opposition.^[97] There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a\nsmall contingent which penetrated the region.^[105] Arabia and Judaea were\neventually subdued.^[105] Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many\nmilestones bearing Vaballathus' name.^[102] Syrian subjugation required less\neffort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in\nAntioch,^[106] Syria's traditional capital.^[90] The invasion of Arabia\ncoincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the\nAntiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on\nSyria.^[106] By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus'\nname.^[107]\n\nThe Arabian milestones presented the Palmyrene king as a Roman governor and\ncommander, referring to him as vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux\nRomanorum.^[102] The assumption of such titles was probably meant to\nlegitimize Zenobia's control of the province, not yet a usurpation of the\nimperial title.^[108] Until now, Zenobia could say that she was acting as a\nrepresentative of the emperor (who was securing the eastern lands of the\nempire) while the Roman monarch was preoccupied with struggles in\nEurope.^[109] Although Vaballathus' use of the titles amounted to a claim to\nthe imperial throne, Zenobia could still justify them and maintain a mask of\nsubordination to Rome;^[83] an \"imperator\" was a commander of troops, not the\nequal of an emperor (\"imperator caesar\").^[108]\n\n##### Annexation of Egypt and the campaigns in Asia Minor[edit]\n\nMain article: Palmyrene invasion of Egypt\n\nThe invasion of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia's desire to secure an\nalternative trade route to the Euphrates, which was cut because of the war\nwith Persia.^[110] This theory ignores the fact that the Euphrates route was\nonly partially disrupted, and overlooks Zenobia's ambition.^[105] The date of\nthe campaign is uncertain; Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and\nbefore Claudius' death, which sets it in the summer of 270.^[111] Watson,\nemphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus'\naccount, places the invasion in October 270 (after Claudius' death).^[112]\nAccording to Watson, the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by\nZenobia (who was encouraged by the news of Claudius' death in\nAugust).^[105]^[113] Zenobia was declared Queen of Egypt after Palmyrene\ninvasion of Egypt.^[114] The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypt's eastern\nfrontier would have contributed to unrest in the province, whose society was\nfractured; Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.^[105]\n\nPalmyra at its zenith in 271\n\nThe Roman position was worsened by the absence of Egypt's prefect, Tenagino\nProbus, who was battling pirates.^[105]^[111] According to Zosimus, the\nPalmyrenes were helped by an Egyptian general named Timagenes; Zabdas moved\ninto Egypt with 70,000 soldiers, defeating an army of 50,000\nRomans.^[113]^[101] After their victory, the Palmyrenes withdrew their main\nforce and left a 5,000-soldier garrison.^[101] By early November,^[105]\nTenagino Probus returned and assembled an army; he expelled the Palmyrenes and\nregained Alexandria, prompting Zabdas to return.^[101] The Palmyrene general\naimed a thrust at Alexandria, where he seems to have had local support; the\ncity fell into Zabdas' hands, and the Roman prefect fled south.^[105] The last\nbattle was at the Babylon Fortress, where Tenagino Probus took refuge; the\nRomans had the upper hand, since they chose their camp carefully.^[106]\nTimagenes, with his knowledge of the land, ambushed the Roman rear; Tenagino\nProbus committed suicide, and Egypt became part of Palmyra.^[106] In the\nHistoria Augusta the Blemmyes were among Zenobia's allies,^[115] and Gary K.\nYoung cites the Blemmyes attack and occupation of Coptos in 268 as evidence of\na Palmyrene-Blemmyes alliance.^[116]\n\nOnly Zosimus mentioned two invasions, contrasting with many scholars who argue\nin favor of an initial invasion and no retreat (followed by a reinforcement,\nwhich took Alexandria by the end of 270).^[101] During the Egyptian campaign,\nRome was entangled in a succession crisis between Claudius' brother Quintillus\nand the general Aurelian. Egyptian papyri and coinage confirm Palmyrene rule\nin Egypt; the papyri stopped using the regnal years of the emperors from\nSeptember to November 270, due to the succession crisis. By December regnal\ndating was resumed, with the papyri using the regnal years of the prevailing\nemperor Aurelian and Zenobia's son Vaballathus. Egyptian coinage was issued in\nthe names of Aurelian and the Palmyrene king by November 270.^[107] There is\nno evidence that Zenobia ever visited Egypt.^[117]\n\nAlthough the operation may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas'\nsecond-in-command, the invasion of Asia Minor did not fully begin until\nZabdas' arrival in the spring of 271.^[118] The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia\nand, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra.^[45] Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint\nremained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon\nfailed.^[118] The Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented, but the western\npart of the region did not become part of the queen's authority;^[45]^[119] no\ncoins with Zenobia or Vaballathus' portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no\nroyal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found.^[119] By August 271 Zabdas was\nback in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.^[118]\n\n#### Governance[edit]\n\nZenobia ruled an empire of different peoples; as a Palmyrene, she was\naccustomed to dealing with multilingual and multicultural diversity since she\nhailed from a city which embraced many cults.^[120] The queen's realm was\nculturally divided into eastern-Semitic and Hellenistic zones; Zenobia tried\nto appease both, and seems to have successfully appealed to the region's\nethnic, cultural and political groups.^[121] The queen projected an image of a\nSyrian monarch, a Hellenistic queen and a Roman empress, which gained broad\nsupport for her cause.^[122]\n\n##### Culture[edit]\n\nThe right colossus of Memnon was probably restored by Zenobia.\n\nZenobia turned her court into a center of learning, with many intellectuals\nand sophists reported in Palmyra during her reign.^[123] As academics migrated\nto the city, it replaced classical learning centers such as Athens for\nSyrians.^[123] The best-known court philosopher was Longinus,^[124] who\narrived during Odaenathus' reign and became Zenobia's tutor in paideia\n(aristocratic education).^[125]^[123] Many historians, including Zosimus,\naccused Longinus of influencing the queen to oppose Rome.^[126]^[125] This\nview presents the queen as malleable,^[125] but, according to Southern,\nZenobia's actions \"cannot be laid entirely at Longinus' door\".^[39] Other\nintellectuals associated with the court included Nicostratus of Trapezus and\nCallinicus of Petra.^[127]\n\nFrom the second to the fourth centuries, Syrian intellectuals argued that\nGreek culture did not evolve in Greece but was adapted from the Near\nEast.^[127] According to Iamblichus, the great Greek philosophers reused Near\nEastern and Egyptian ideas.^[128] The Palmyrene court was probably dominated\nby this school of thought, with an intellectual narrative presenting Palmyra's\ndynasty as a Roman imperial one succeeding the Persian, Seleucid and Ptolemaic\nrulers who controlled the region in which Hellenistic culture allegedly\noriginated.^[128] Nicostratus wrote a history of the Roman Empire from Philip\nthe Arab to Odaenathus, presenting the latter as a legitimate imperial\nsuccessor and contrasting his successes with the disastrous reigns of the\nemperors.^[127]\n\nZenobia embarked on several restoration projects in Egypt.^[129] One of the\nColossi of Memnon was reputed in antiquity to sing; the sound was probably due\nto cracks in the statue, with solar rays interacting with dew in the\ncracks.^[130] The historian Glen Bowersock proposed that the queen restored\nthe colossus (\"silencing\" it), which would explain third-century accounts of\nthe singing and their disappearance in the fourth.^[131]\n\n##### Religion[edit]\n\nPalmyra's most important deities: (right to left) Bel, Yarhibol, Aglibol and\nBaalshamin\n\nZenobia followed the Palmyrene paganism,^[132] where a number of Semitic gods,\nwith Bel at the head of the pantheon, were worshipped.^[133] Zenobia\naccommodated Christians and Jews,^[120] and ancient sources made many claims\nabout the queen's beliefs;^[42] Manichaean sources alleged that Zenobia was\none of their own;^[134] a manuscript dated to 272 mentions that the Queen of\nPalmyra supported the Manichaeans in establishing a community in Abidar, which\nwas under the rule of a king named Amar\u014d, who could be the Lakhmid king Amr\nibn Adi.^[135] It is more likely, however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in\nan effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.^[42]\n\nBishop Athanasius of Alexandria wrote that Zenobia did not \"hand over churches\nto the Jews to make them into synagogues\";^[136] although the queen was not a\nChristian, she understood the power of bishops in Christian communities.^[137]\nIn Antioch\u2014considered representative of political control of the East and\ncontaining a large Christian community\u2014Zenobia apparently maintained authority\nover the church by bringing influential clerics, probably including Paul of\nSamosata, under her auspices.^[137] She may have bestowed on Paul the rank of\nducenarius (minor judge); he apparently enjoyed the queen's protection, which\nhelped him keep the diocesan church after he was removed from his office as\nbishop of Antioch by a synod of bishops in 268.^[138] Hughes suggested that\nPaul's position while Zenobia ruled was in the state treasury.^[139]^[note 15]\n\n###### Judaism[edit]\n\nLess than a hundred years after Zenobia's reign, Athanasius of Alexandria\ncalled her a \"Jewess\" in his History of the Arians.^[136] In 391, archbishop\nJohn Chrysostom wrote that Zenobia was Jewish; so did a Syriac chronicler\naround 664 and bishop Bar Hebraeus in the thirteenth century.^[136] According\nto French scholar Javier Teixidor, Zenobia was probably a proselyte; this\nexplained her strained relationship with the rabbis.^[143] Teixidor believed\nthat Zenobia became interested in Judaism when Longinus spoke about the\nphilosopher Porphyry and his interest in the Old Testament.^[143] Although\nTalmudic sources were hostile to Palmyra because of Odaenathus' suppression of\nthe Jews of Nehardea,^[144] Zenobia apparently had the support of some Jewish\ncommunities (particularly in Alexandria).^[118] In Cairo,^[145] a plaque\noriginally bearing an inscription confirming a grant of immunity to a Jewish\nsynagogue in the last quarter of the first millennium BC by King Ptolemy\nEuergetes (I or II) was found.^[145] At a much later date, the plaque was re-\ninscribed to commemorate the restoration of immunity \"on the orders of the\nqueen and king\".^[129]^[145] Although it is undated, the letters of the\ninscription date to long after Cleopatra and Anthony's era; Zenobia and her\nson are the only candidates for a king and a queen ruling Egypt after the\nPtolemies.^[129]^[146]\n\nThe historian E. Mary Smallwood wrote that good relations with the diaspora\ncommunity did not mean that the Jews of Palestine were content with Zenobia's\nreign, and her rule was apparently opposed in that region.^[144] The Jerusalem\nTalmud, in Tractate Terumot tells the story of the amoraim Rabbi \"Ammi\" and\nRabbi \"Samuel bar Nahmani\", who visited Zenobia's court and asked for the\nrelease of a Jew (\"Zeir bar Hinena\") detained on her orders.^[147] The queen\nrefused, saying: \"Why have you come to save him? He teaches that your creator\nperforms miracles for you. Why not let God save him?\"^[148] During Aurelian's\ndestruction of Palmyra, Palestinian conscripts with \"clubs and cudgels\" (who\nmay have been Jews) played a vital role in Zenobia's defeat and the\ndestruction of her city.^[149]\n\nThere is no evidence of Zenobia's birth as a Jew; the names of her and her\nhusband's families belonged to the Aramaic onomasticon (collection of\nnames).^[143] The queen's alleged patronage of Paul of Samosata (who was\naccused of \"Judaizing\"),^[144] may have given rise to the idea that she was a\nproselyte.^[42] Only Christian accounts note Zenobia's Jewishness; no Jewish\nsource mentions it.^[150]\n\n##### Administration[edit]\n\nThe queen probably spent most of her reign in Antioch,^[117] Syria's\nadministrative capital.^[90] Before the monarchy, Palmyra had the institutions\nof a Greek city (polis) and was ruled by a senate which was responsible for\nmost civil affairs.^[151]^[152] Odaenathus maintained Palmyra's institutions,\nas did Zenobia;^[153] a Palmyrene inscription after her fall records the name\nof Septimius Haddudan, a Palmyrene senator.^[154] However, the queen\napparently ruled autocratically; Septimius Worod, Odaenathus' viceroy and one\nof Palmyra's most important officials, disappeared from the record after\nZenobia's ascent.^[155] The queen opened the doors of her government to\nEastern nobility.^[120] Zenobia's most important courtiers and advisers were\nher generals, Septemius Zabdas and Septimius Zabbai;^[124] both of whom were\ngenerals under Odaenathus and received the gentilicium (surname) \"Septimius\"\nfrom him.^[156]\n\nOdaenathus respected the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial\ngovernors,^[157] and Zenobia continued this policy during her early\nreign.^[158] Although the queen did not interfere in day-to-day\nadministration, she probably had the power to command the governors in the\norganization of border security.^[159] During the rebellion, Zenobia\nmaintained Roman forms of administration,^[45] but appointed the governors\nherself (most notably in Egypt,^[160] where Julius Marcellinus took office in\n270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).^[note 16]^[159]\n\n###### Agreement with Rome[edit]\n\nPalmyrene antoninianus minted in Antioch in AD 271, showing Aurelian (left) as\nemperor and Vaballathus as king\n\nZenobia initially avoided provoking Rome by claiming for herself and her son\nthe titles, inherited from Odaenathus, of subject of Rome and protector of its\neastern frontier.^[93] After expanding her territory, she seems to have tried\nto be recognized as an imperial partner in the eastern half of the empire and\npresented her son as subordinate to the emperor.^[162]^[109]^[163] In late\n270, Zenobia minted coinage bearing the portraits of Aurelian and Vaballathus;\nAurelian was titled \"emperor\", and Vaballathus \"king\".^[162] The regnal year\nin early samples of the coinage was only Aurelian's.^[162] By March 271,^[164]\ndespite indicating Aurelian as the paramount monarch by naming him first in\nthe dating formulae, the coinage also began bearing Vaballathus' regnal\nyear.^[165] By indicating in the coinage that Vaballathus' reign began in 267\n(three years before the emperor's), Vaballathus appeared to be Aurelian's\nsenior colleague.^[165]\n\nThe emperor's blessing of Palmyrene authority has been debated;^[163]\nAurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may be inferred from the\nOxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and\nVaballathus.^[162]^[166] No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the\nevidence is based solely on the joint coinage- and papyri-dating.^[163] It is\nunlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing,^[162] but he\nwas unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West.^[163]^[162] His apparent\ncondoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her a false sense\nof security while he prepared for war.^[163]^[162] Another reason for\nAurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of\nEgyptian grain to Rome;^[167] it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and\nthe ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual.^[160] Some modern scholars, such as\nHarold Mattingly, suggest that Claudius Gothicus had concluded a formal\nagreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.^[43]\n\n#### Empress and open rebellion[edit]\n\nCoin of Zenobia as empress with Juno on the reverse, AD 272\n\nAn inscription, found in Palmyra and dated to August 271, called Zenobia\neusebes (the pious);^[164] this title, used by Roman empresses, could be seen\nas a step by the queen toward an imperial title.^[168] Another contemporary\ninscription called her sebaste, the Greek equivalent of \"empress\" (Latin:\nAugusta), but also acknowledged the Roman emperor.^[168] A late-271 Egyptian\ngrain receipt equated Aurelian and Vaballathus, jointly calling them\nAugusti.^[168] Finally, Palmyra officially broke with Rome;^[169] the\nAlexandrian and Antiochian mints removed Aurelian's portrait from the coins in\nApril 272, issuing new tetradrachms in the names of Vaballathus and Zenobia\n(who were called Augustus and Augusta, respectively).^[168]\n\nThe assumption of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation:\nindependence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian.^[170] The timeline of\nevents and why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague.^[171] In the second\nhalf of 271,^[172] Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths\nin the Balkans;^[170] this may have alarmed the queen, driving her to claim\nthe imperial title.^[171] Zenobia also probably understood the inevitability\nof open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning subordination would\nbe useless;^[173] her assumption of the imperial title was used to rally\nsoldiers to her cause.^[173] Aurelian's campaign seems to have been the main\nreason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait\nfrom its coins.^[168]^[99]\n\n#### Downfall[edit]\n\nRoute of Aurelian's campaign\n\nThe usurpation, which began in late March or early April 272, ended by\nAugust.^[174] Aurelian spent the winter of 271\u2013272 in Byzantium,^[175] and\nprobably crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 272.^[176] Galatia fell\neasily; the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn, and the provincial\ncapital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle.^[177] All the cities in\nAsia Minor opened their doors to the Roman emperor, with only Tyana putting up\nsome resistance before surrendering; this cleared the path for Aurelian to\ninvade Syria, the Palmyrene heartland.^[178] A simultaneous expedition reached\nEgypt in May 272; by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans,\nfollowed by the rest of Egypt by the third week of June.^[177] Zenobia seems\nto have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syria\u2014which, if\nlost, would have meant the end of Palmyra.^[176]\n\nIn May 272, Aurelian headed toward Antioch.^[179] About 40 kilometres (25 mi)\nnorth of the city, he defeated the Palmyrene army (led by Zabdas) at the\nBattle of Immae.^[179]^[180] As a result, Zenobia, who waited in Antioch\nduring the battle, retreated with her army to Emesa.^[181] To conceal the\ndisaster and make her flight safer, she spread reports that Aurelian was\ncaptured; Zabdas found a man who resembled the Roman emperor and paraded him\nthrough Antioch.^[182] The following day, Aurelian entered the city before\nmarching south.^[181] After defeating a Palmyrene garrison south of\nAntioch,^[183] Aurelian continued his march to meet Zenobia in the Battle of\nEmesa.^[183]\n\nThe 70,000-strong Palmyrene army, assembled on the plain of Emesa, nearly\nrouted the Romans.^[183] In an initial thrill of victory they hastened their\nadvance, breaking their lines and enabling the Roman infantry to attack their\nflank.^[183] The defeated Zenobia headed to her capital on the advice of her\nwar council, leaving her treasury behind.^[184] In Palmyra, the empress\nprepared for a siege;^[185] Aurelian blockaded food-supply routes,^[186] and\nthere were probably unsuccessful negotiations.^[187] According to the Augustan\nHistory, Zenobia said that she would fight Aurelian with the help of her\nPersian allies; however, the story was probably fabricated and used by the\nemperor to link Zenobia to Rome's greatest enemy.^[187] If such an alliance\nexisted, a much-larger frontier war would have erupted; however, no Persian\narmy was sent.^[187] As the situation worsened, the queen left the city for\nPersia intending on seeking help from Palmyra's former enemy; according to\nZosimus, she rode a \"female camel, the fastest of its breed and faster than\nany horse\".^[184]^[188]\n\n## Captivity and fate[edit]\n\nHadrian's Villa; Zenobia reportedly spent her last days in a villa near\nHadrian's complex in Tibur.\n\nAurelian, learning about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured\nthe empress before she could cross the Euphrates to Persia;^[188] Palmyra\ncapitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August\n272.^[note 17]^[190]^[154] Aurelian sent the empress and her son to Emesa for\ntrial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus).^[191]\nAccording to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on\nher advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial,\nonly later hostile Roman ones.^[191] The empress's reported cowardice in\ndefeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint\nZenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing\nher as a hero.^[191] Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he\nspared the empress and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.^[192]\n\nZenobia's fate after Emesa is uncertain since ancient historians left\nconflicting accounts.^[193] Zosimus wrote that she died before crossing the\nBosporus on her way to Rome; according to this account, the empress became ill\nor starved herself to death.^[193] The generally unreliable chronicler, John\nMalalas,^[194] wrote that Aurelian humiliated Zenobia by parading her through\nthe eastern cities on a dromedary; in Antioch, the emperor had her chained and\nseated on a dais in the hippodrome for three days before the city's\npopulace.^[193]^[195] Malalas concluded his account by writing that Zenobia\nappeared in Aurelian's triumph and was then beheaded.^[196]\n\nMost ancient historians and modern scholars agree that Zenobia was displayed\nin Aurelian's 274 triumph;^[196] Zosimus was the only source to say that the\nempress died before reaching Rome, making his account questionable.^[197] A\npublic humiliation (as recounted by Malalas) is a plausible scenario, since\nAurelian would probably have wanted to publicize his suppression of the\nPalmyrene rebellion.^[193] Only Malalas, however, describes Zenobia's\nbeheading; according to the other historians, her life was spared after\nAurelian's triumph.^[196] The Augustan History recorded that Aurelian gave\nZenobia a villa in Tibur near Hadrian's Villa, where she lived with her\nchildren.^[198]^[199] Zonaras wrote that Zenobia married a nobleman,^[200] and\nSyncellus wrote that she married a Roman senator.^[198] The house she\nreportedly occupied became a tourist attraction in Rome.^[201]\n\n## Titles[edit]\n\nLead token naming Zenobia as queen c. 268\n\nThe queen owed her elevated position to her son's minority.^[202] To celebrate\nHerodianus' coronation, a statue was erected in Palmyra in 263.^[203]\nAccording to the inscription on the base of the statue, it was commissioned by\nSeptimius Worod, then the duumviri (magistrate) of Palmyra, and Julius\nAurelius, the Queen's procurator (treasurer).^[204] According to the historian\nDavid Potter, Zenobia is the queen mentioned, and the inscription is an\nevidence for the usage of the title by her during Odaenathus' lifetime.^[205]\nAn inscription on a milestone on the road between Palmyra and Emesa, dated to\nZenobia's early reign,^[206] identifies her as \"illustrious queen, mother of\nthe king of kings\";^[35] this was the first inscription giving her an official\nposition.^[207] A lead token from Antioch also identifies Zenobia as\nqueen.^[note 18]^[211]^[210]\n\nThe earliest confirmed attestation of Zenobia as queen in Palmyra is an\ninscription on the base of a statue erected for her by Zabdas and Zabbai,\ndated to August 271 and calling her \"most illustrious and pious\nqueen\".^[207]^[212] On an undated milestone found near Byblos, Zenobia is\ntitled Sebaste.^[171] The queen was never acknowledged as sole monarch in\nPalmyra, although she was the de facto sovereign of the empire;^[74] she was\nalways associated with her husband or son in inscriptions, except in Egypt\n(where some coins were minted in Zenobia's name alone).^[74] According to her\ncoins, the queen assumed the title of Augusta (empress) in 272,^[168] and\nreigned under the regnal name Septimia Zenobia Augusta.^[213]\n\n## Descendants[edit]\n\nSeptimius Herodianus, might have been the same person as Hairan II, a probable\nson of Zenobia\n\nAside from Vaballathus, it is unclear if Zenobia had other children, and their\nalleged identities are subject to scholarly disagreements. The image of a\nchild named Hairan (II) appears on a seal impression with that of his brother\nVaballathus; no name of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated.^[214]\nOdaenathus' son Herodianus is identified by Udo Hartmann with Hairan I, a son\nof Odaenathus who appears in Palmyrene inscriptions as early as 251.^[215]\nDavid S. Potter, on the other hand, suggested that Hairan II is the son of\nZenobia and that he is Herodianus instead of Hairan I.^[216] Nathanael Andrade\nmaintained that Hairan I, Herodianus, and Hairan II are the same person,\nrejecting the existence of a second Hairan.^[217]\n\nA controversial Palmyrene inscription mentions the mother of the King\nSeptimius Antiochus; the name of the queen is missing, and Dittenberger\nrefused to fill the gap with Zenobia's name, but many scholars, such as Grace\nMacurdy considered that the missing name is Zenobia.^[213] Septimius Antiochus\nmay have been Vaballathus' younger brother, or was presented in this manner\nfor political reasons; Antiochus was proclaimed emperor in 273, when Palmyra\nrevolted against Rome for a second time.^[218] If Antiochus was a son of\nZenobia, he was probably a young child not fathered by Odaenathus; Zosimus\ndescribed him as insignificant, appropriate for a five-year-old boy.^[219] On\nthe other hand, Macurdy, citing the language Zosimus used when he described\nhim, considered it more plausible that Antiochus was not a son of Zenobia, but\na family relation who used her name to legitimize his claim to the\nthrone.^[213]\n\nThe names of Herennianus and Timolaus were mentioned as children of Zenobia\nonly in the Historia Augusta.^[220] Herennianus may be a conflation of Hairan\nand Herodianus; Timolaus is probably a fabrication,^[68] although the\nhistorian Dietmar Kienast suggested that he might have been Vaballathus.^[221]\nAccording to the Historia Augusta, Zenobia's descendants were Roman nobility\nduring the reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364\u2013375).^[222] Eutropius and\nJerome chronicled the queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth\ncenturies.^[201]^[199] They may have been the result of a reported marriage to\na Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories,\nhowever, are tentative.^[223] Zonaras is the only historian to note that\nZenobia had daughters;^[223] he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married\nthe queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans.^[200] According to\nSouthern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication.^[198]\nAnother descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence (337\u2013417)\nwith the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth\ncentury saint,^[224] and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286.^[225]\nThe family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was\na descendant of her.^[226]\n\n## Evaluation and legacy[edit]\n\nAn evaluation of Zenobia is difficult; the queen was courageous when her\nhusband's supremacy was threatened and by seizing the throne, she protected\nthe region from a power vacuum after Odaenathus' death.^[227] According to\nWatson, she made what Odaenathus left her a \"glittering show of\nstrength\".^[228] In the view of Watson, Zenobia should not be seen as a total\npowermonger, nor as a selfless hero fighting for a cause; according to the\nhistorian David Graf, \"She took seriously the titles and responsibilities she\nassumed for her son and that her program was far more ecumenical and\nimaginative than that of her husband Odenathus, not just more\nambitious\".^[228]\n\nZenobia has inspired scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has\nlingered in the West, and is supreme in the Middle East.^[23] As a heroic\nqueen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica.^[23] The\nqueen's legend turned her into an idol, that can be reinterpreted to\naccommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by\nturns a freedom fighter, a hero of the oppressed and a national symbol.^[27]\nThe queen is a female role model;^[229] according to the historian Michael\nRostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia as a\nwoman who created military might and an intellectual court.^[202] During the\n1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for\nwomen's-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong,\nnationalistic female leader.^[230]\n\nHer most lasting legacy is in Syria, where the queen is a national\nsymbol.^[231] Zenobia became an icon for Syrian nationalists; she had a cult\nfollowing among Western-educated Syrians, and an 1871 novel by journalist\nSalim Al Bustani was entitled Zenobia malikat Tadmor (Zenobia, Queen of\nPalmyra).^[232] Syrian nationalist Ilyas Matar, who wrote Syria's first\nhistory in Arabic in 1874,^[233]^[234] (al-'Uqud al-durriyya fi tarikh al-\nmamlaka al-Suriyya; The Pearl Necklace in the History of the Syrian\nKingdom),^[235] was fascinated by Zenobia and included her in his book.^[236]\nTo Matar, the queen kindled hope for a new Zenobia who would restore Syria's\nformer grandeur.^[236] Another history of Syria was written by Jurji Yanni in\n1881,^[237] in which Yanni called Zenobia a \"daughter of the fatherland\", and\nyearned for her \"glorious past\".^[238] Yanni described Aurelian as a tyrant\nwho deprived Syria of its happiness and independence by capturing its\nqueen.^[238]\n\nIn modern Syria, Zenobia is regarded as a patriotic symbol; her image appeared\non banknotes,^[231] and in 1997 she was the subject of the television series\nAl-Ababeed (The Anarchy).^[23] The series was watched by millions in the\nArabic-speaking world.^[23] It examined the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict from\na Syrian perspective, where the queen's struggle symbolized the Palestinians'\nstruggle to gain the right of self-determination.^[231] Zenobia was also the\nsubject of a biography by Mustafa Tlass, Syria's former minister of defense\nand one of the country's most prominent figures.^[231]\n\n## Myth, romanticism and popular culture[edit]\n\nHarold Mattingly called Zenobia \"one of the most romantic figures in\nhistory\".^[227] According to Southern, \"The real Zenobia is elusive, perhaps\nultimately unattainable, and novelists, playwrights and historians alike can\nabsorb the available evidence, but still need to indulge in varied degrees of\nspeculation.\"^[239]\n\nShe has been the subject of romantic and ideologically-driven biographies by\nancient and modern writers.^[240]^[241] The Augustan History is the clearest\nexample of an ideological account of Zenobia's life, and its author\nacknowledged that it was written to criticize the emperor Gallienus.^[241]\nAccording to the Augustan History, Gallienus was weak because he allowed a\nwoman to rule part of the empire and Zenobia was a more able sovereign than\nthe emperor. The narrative changed as the Augustan History moved on to the\nlife of Claudius Gothicus, a lauded and victorious emperor, with the author\ncharacterizing Zenobia's protection of the eastern frontier as a wise\ndelegation of power by Claudius.^[242] When the Augustan History reached the\nbiography of Aurelian, the author's view of Zenobia changed dramatically; the\nqueen is depicted as a guilty, insolent, proud coward;^[242] her wisdom was\ndiscredited and her actions deemed the result of manipulation by\nadvisers.^[53]\n\nZenobia's \"staunch\" beauty was emphasized by the author of the Augustan\nHistory, who ascribed to her feminine timidity and inconsistency (the reasons\nfor her alleged betrayal of her advisers to save herself). The queen's sex\nposed a dilemma for the Augustan History since it cast a shadow on Aurelian's\nvictory.^[243] Its author ascribed many masculine traits to Zenobia to make\nAurelian a conquering hero who suppressed a dangerous Amazon queen.^[243]\nAccording to the Augustan History, Zenobia had a clear, manly voice, dressed\nas an emperor (rather than an empress), rode horseback, was attended by\neunuchs instead of ladies-in-waiting, marched with her army, drank with her\ngenerals, was careful with money (contrary to the stereotypical spending\nhabits of her sex) and pursued masculine hobbies such as hunting.^[244]\nGiovanni Boccaccio wrote a fanciful 14th-century account of the queen in which\nshe is a tomboy in childhood who preferred wrestling with boys, wandering in\nthe forests and killing goats to playing like a young girl.^[245] Zenobia's\nchastity was a theme of these romanticized accounts; according to the Augustan\nHistory, she disdained sexual intercourse and allowed Odaenathus into her bed\nonly for conception.^[245] Her reputed chastity impressed some male\nhistorians; Edward Gibbon wrote that Zenobia surpassed Cleopatra in chastity\nand valor.^[245] According to Boccaccio, Zenobia safeguarded her virginity\nwhen she wrestled with boys as a child.^[245]\n\nSeventeenth-century visitors to Palmyra rekindled the Western world's romantic\ninterest in Zenobia.^[53] This interest peaked during the mid-nineteenth\ncentury, when Lady Hester Stanhope visited Palmyra and wrote that its people\ntreated her like the queen; she was reportedly greeted with singing and\ndancing, and Bedouin warriors stood on the city's columns.^[30] A procession\nended with a mock coronation of Stanhope under the arch of Palmyra as \"queen\nof the desert\".^[30] William Ware, fascinated by Zenobia, wrote a fanciful\naccount of her life. Twentieth-century novelists and playwrights, such as\nHaley Elizabeth Garwood and Nick Dear, also wrote about the queen.^[21]\n\n### Selected cultural depictions[edit]\n\nHarriet Hosmer's Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra (1857)\n\nQueen Zenobia's Last Look upon Palmyra by Herbert Gustave Schmalz (1888)\n\n  * Sculptures:\n\n    \n\n  * Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra (1857) by Harriet Hosmer, exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago.^[246]\n  * Zenobia in Chains (1859) by Harriet Hosmer.

they were included in the series named Berliner Turfantexte launched in 1971.^[17]\n  4. ^ Both Dittenberger and von Sallet believed that Zenobia bore the gentilicium Julia Aurelia during her marriage and took the gentilicium Septimia after Odaenathus' death; von Sallet argued that the coins minted by Vaballathus in Alexandria bore the initials of the names \"Julius\", \"Aurelius\" and \"Septimius\", before his own name.^[33] Therefore, it is apparent that Vaballathus took his maternal family's name beside his paternal one.^[14]\n  5. ^ The writer of the Historia Augusta might have based his account on the work of Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote about the habits of men in \"vaulted baths\" and how they extol women \"with such disgraceful flattery as the Parthians do Semiramis, the Egyptians their Cleopatras, the Carians [do] Artemisia, or the people of Palmyra [do] Zenobia\".^[9] If the Historia Augusta writer did indeed use the words of Ammianus, then the remark about Zenobia's supposed descent loses its merit.^[9]\n  6. ^ The conclusion that Callinicus meant Zenobia is based on the fact that the work was written following Palmyra's invasion of Egypt, combined with what is known about Zenobia's alleged claims of descent from Cleopatra.^[39] The first scholar to suggest that, by Cleopatra, Callinicus meant Zenobia was Aurel Stein, in 1923, and his view was accepted by many other historians.^[41]\n  7. ^ The Roman view of Cleopatra was negative; she was portrayed as a traitorous manipulative woman who used her beauty and sex to achieve her goals.^[44]\n  8. ^ The Roman East traditionally included all the Roman lands in Asia east of the Bosphorus.^[78]\n  9. ^ A plausible scenario, according to the historian David Potter, would be that a campaign was sent in 270 by Claudius Gothicus, Gallienus' successor.^[85]\n  10. ^ An often-cited argument for limited territorial control is that the Antiochean Mint did not issue coins in the name of the queen or her son before 270.^[87] However, in the opinion of Southern, this can be explained by the existence of Claudius Gothicus on the imperial throne, which made it unnecessary for the queen to issue coins in the name of her son.^[87] After Claudius' death in 270, the imperial throne was contested by his brother Quintillus and the army candidate Aurelian, but the Antiochean mint, probably under orders from Zenobia (who apparently did not recognize Quintillus) did not issue coins for both pretenders.^[87] When Aurelian prevailed, Zenobia might have found it an opportunity to declare for him; the new coins bore the picture of Aurelian but also, for the first time, Vaballathus.^[87]\n  11. ^ The palace was probably established by Odaenathus who crowned his son in Antioch,^[87] Syria's historical capital.^[90]\n  12. ^ According to the Historia Augusta the emperor Aurelian sent a letter to the Senate saying that the Egyptians, Armenians and Arabs were so afraid of Zenobia that they did not dare revolt; however, the author does not say that the Syrians were afraid of the queen.^[91]\n  13. ^ Ancient sources accused Zenobia of sympathizing with the Persians, claiming that she was worshiped like the Persian leaders and drank wine with their generals;^[95] however, the accusations are unfounded since Zenobia fortified the frontier with Persia.^[94]\n  14. ^ Although his name is only mentioned by John Malalas, archaeological evidence supports the Arabian campaign.^[102]\n  15. ^ Paul of Samosata is considered a heretic by mainstream Christianity, accused of denying the preexistence of Christ.^[140] The earliest reference to the relationship between Zenobia and Paul of Samosata comes from Athanasius of Alexandria's fourth-century History of the Arians.^[141] According to Eusebius, Paul preferred to be called \"ducenarius\" instead of bishop;^[142]^[137] There is evidence that he held this rank in the service of Zenobia.^[138] There is no evidence that Paul was invited to the Palmyrene court, and his relationship with Zenobia was exaggerated by later sources.^[120]^[42] The queen may have supported him as bishop to promote religious tolerance.^[120]\n  16. ^ One of Statilius' inscriptions is firmly dated to spring 272, so he could have been appointed by the Romans who regained Egypt at that time.^[161]\n  17. ^ Many ancient writers, including John Malalas, Rufius Festus, Jordanes, George Syncellus and Jerome, mistakenly wrote that Zenobia was captured at Immae.^[189]\n  18. ^ Dated to 268,^[208] its code in Delbert R. Hillers and Eleonora Cussini's work, titled \"Palmyrene Aramaic Texts\" (PAT),^[209] is PAT 2827, and the inscription read: queen Zenobia.^[210]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^
