None\nof the scrutinised platforms completely achieved our baseline criteria which\nwe developed for this \u201cstress test\u201d.\n\nThe need for transparency in online advertising has never been more critical\nas nefarious use of ads is on the rise (see our Facebook Hustles\ninvestigation, AI Forensic paper, EU DisinfoLab, Reset, Stiftung Neue\nVerantwortung, and Qurium reports) and they can be used for destabilisation\nattempts. Ad libraries, which are now mandated by the DSA for designated\nservices, should enable researchers and users to understand and analyse who is\nbehind an ad, how and who it targets. Not only did we find that no platform is\ncurrently delivering fully adequate tools to achieve these goals, but each and\nevery company presents data in a different format, complicating comparisons\nacross datasets. This is why Check First proposes the adoption of the\nStandardised Digital Advertising Format (SDAF), a common format for ad data.\n\n## What we found in our research: tech giants\u2019 ad transparency tools fail to\nmeet our expectations\n\nThe research we conducted revealed a stark reality: the ad transparency tools\ndeveloped by the major platforms are failing to meet their intended purpose.\nLet\u2019s face it, our study, Full Disclosure: Stress-testing tech platforms\u2019 ad\nrepositories, paints a bleak picture. A striking example? Only 5 platforms out\nof the 14 analysed allow users to find their way to the ad library from their\nmain interface. These tools are supposedly designed to help watchdogs monitor\nad content across platforms and to enable researchers to monitor a wide range\nof issues such as election disinformation. These are critical tools for the\nresearch community to raise awareness about scams, misleading ads, and ads\nthat may violate election rules or terms and conditions of the platforms like\npolitical ads on TikTok. Given the audiences of these major platforms, you can\nonly imagine the damage this can do, especially in this election year when\nalmost half of the world\u2019s population will vote.\n\n## Who did we investigate?\n\nWe examined AliExpress, Apple App Store, Bing, Booking.com, Alphabet\u2019s Google\nSearch & YouTube, LinkedIn, Meta, Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, X, and Zalando.\nCheckFirst researchers evaluated these ad libraries based on over 20\nparameters, including functionality, data accessibility and accuracy, inspired\nby both the DSA rules and Ad API guidelines created by Mozilla and other\nresearchers in 2019.\n\nNone of the advertising transparency tools studied were found to be\nsufficiently effective, leaving voters around the world vulnerable to\nmanipulation and misinformation. The implications extend beyond the borders of\nthe European Union, potentially affecting countries such as the United States,\nMexico and India, all of which have major elections in the near future. For\nexample, X, formerly known as Twitter, is particularly disappointing. X\u2019s\ntransparency tool offers no filtering and sorting capabilities, ads can only\nbe accessed through a cumbersome CSV export file; the content of ads is not\ndisclosed (only a URL to the ads), and there are gaps in targeting parameters\nand recipient data:\n\n> \u201cIn order to search for a specific ad, the user needs to know who placed the\n> ad, in which country, and when. All three pieces of information have to be\n> known, which makes natural search impossible\u201d\n>\n> Amaury L., Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of CheckFirst\n\nWhile some platforms such as Apple, LinkedIn and TikTok fared slightly better,\nthey too had significant gaps in data and functionality. Issues such as search\nrate limitations, poor sorting and filtering capabilities, and limited\naccessibility were common across most platforms.\n\nAmaury L. emphasised the importance of transparency in advertising on big\nplatforms, especially in areas that affect the public interest, such as fair\nelections and public health.\n\n> \u201cWho\u2019s paying for ads and how they\u2019re targeted is critical to helping\n> watchdogs look out for the public interest \u2013 whether it\u2019s fair elections,\n> public health or social justice. In short, if you see an ad telling you that\n> climate change is a hoax, you might be interested to know if that ad is paid\n> for by the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\nAdditional findings from the study underscored missing ads, inconsistent\npublic accessibility across platforms, and a lack of adequate search features.\nFurthermore, paid influencer content or \u2018branded content\u2019 raised concerns\nabout underreporting and transparency in this domain.\n\n## Our key recommendation: a common and standardised tool for ad libraries\n\nBased on these worrying findings, CheckFirst put forward the Standardised\nDigital Advertising Format (SDAF). The goal of this data framework is to\nenable comparative research across ad data across platforms.\n\nOur goal is to help the stakeholders to create accessible, logical,\ninteroperable ad repositories. We firmly believe that our open source standard\ncan contribute to such an endeavour, within the strong framework of the DSA.\nWe are very proud that this tool is supported by organisations like Reset, AI\nForensics, Who Targets Me, Check My Ads, SNV.\n\nOnly through collaborative efforts can we mitigate the harm made by the lack\nof transparency. This is precisely what this study is about: the urgent need\nfor improved accountability and oversight mechanisms in online advertising by\nthe largest online platforms.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\n#### Indeed!, the CheckFirst Newsletter\n\nDiscover Indeed! our homemade newsletter delivered straight in your inbox with\nall the updates from Check First and it\u2019s projects!\n\nSubscribe\n\n#### Related resources\n\n##### 22vlalapub: an analysis of political advertising on Meta, Google and\nSnapchat during French presidential election\n\nDuring 4 months, Check First monitored political advertising using its tool\n22vlalapub.fr.
