When the new CEO of Wendy\u2019s\nmentioned that the company might introduce \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d in 2025, Ruggless\nwasn\u2019t surprised; many restaurants have started adjusting prices depending on\nthe time of day or week. It seemed like minor news, so he wrote up a brief\nreport. He didn\u2019t even bother to post it on social media.\n\nAbout 10 days later, Ruggless saw that Wendy\u2019s was going viral. The Daily Mail\nand the New York Post had picked up the story, framing the new policy as\n\u201csurge pricing.\u201d On X, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the plan \u201cprice gouging\nplain and simple.\u201d Burger King trolled Wendy\u2019s: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in charging\npeople more when they\u2019re hungry.\u201d Wendy\u2019s went into damage control. In a\nstatement, it claimed that it wasn\u2019t planning to raise prices during high-\ndemand times, but rather to lower prices during low-demand times. That\ndistinction was lost on most observers\u2014including, frankly, this one\u2014and the\nnarrative took hold that Wendy\u2019s was the next Uber.\n\nThe anti-Wendy\u2019s backlash made sense. Who wants to pull into a drive-through\nwithout knowing how much the food is going to cost? But it was also selective.\nDynamic pricing is hardly new. Airlines have been charging flexible fares for\ndecades. Prices on Amazon change millions of times a day. Grocery stores have\nbegun using digital displays to adjust prices on the fly. The list grows by\nthe week.\n\nPrices aren\u2019t just changing more often\u2014they\u2019re getting more complex, too.\nFees, long the specialty of banks and credit-card companies, have proliferated\nacross industries. Previously self-contained products (toothbrushes, movies,\nMicrosoft Word) have turned into subscriptions, while previously bundled items\n(Wi-Fi at hotels, meals on airplanes) are now sold separately. Buying stuff\nonline means navigating a flurry of discount codes, often just expired.\nMeanwhile, prices are becoming more personalized as companies hoover up\ncustomer data.\n\nWe\u2019re used to thinking of prices as static and universal. Sure, they might\nrise with inflation or dip during a sale, but in general, the price is the\nprice, and it\u2019s the same for everyone. And we like it that way. It makes our\neconomic lives predictable, and, perhaps more importantly, it feels fair. But\nthat arrangement is under attack from two directions. The first is\nobfuscation: the breaking down of prices into components and the piling on of\nfees. The second is discrimination: the charging of different prices to\ndifferent customers at different times.\n\nContempt for fees is strong enough to unite even Republicans and Democrats,\nand price discrimination isn\u2019t any more popular. One survey showed that half\nof customers think of dynamic pricing as price gouging; surge pricing in\nrideshare apps leads to more customer complaints; and polls show that shoppers\nare worried about companies collecting their data to shape prices.\n\nThe battle is not just between businesses and consumers, but also between\neconomists, who prize efficiency, and the rest of us, who care about fairness.\nAnd right now, efficiency is running away with it. For every Wendy\u2019s, there\nare a thousand companies quietly implementing similar schemes, in an ongoing\nquest to get every last burger\u2014or car, or ink cartridge, or hotel room\u2014into\nevery last hand, for every last penny. Despite the occasional outcry, the era\nof the single price is rapidly fading into the past. In many ways, it\u2019s\nalready gone.\n\nPricing occupies a murky space between the mind and the gut. Some early\nphilosophers thought the price of a thing should be determined by its\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d value, whatever that means, while others argued that its utility\nmattered most. Plato was against variable pricing. \u201cHe who sells anything in\nthe agora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells, but he shall ask\none,\u201d he wrote in Laws. He also inveighed against the hotel fees of his day,\ncondemning people who show hospitality to travelers but then extract \u201cthe most\nunjust, abominable, and extortionate ransom.\u201d\n\nThe rise of the market economy shifted the understanding of price to be\nwhatever someone is willing to pay for it. But even then, price remained\nattached to our sense of right and wrong. John Wanamaker, the Philadelphia\nentrepreneur credited with inventing the price tag in the 1800s, was a devout\nChristian whose advertisements promised \u201cno favoritism.\u201d According to a\nhagiographic history of the Wanamaker empire from 1911, \u201cOne price to all was\nneither more nor less than the application to merchandising of the immortal\nnote of equality sounded in the second sentence of the Declaration on\nIndependence.\u201d The price tag had practical benefits, too: You didn\u2019t have to\ntrain employees to haggle.\n\nModern pricing \u201cinnovation\u201d took off with the airlines. From the late 1930s\nthrough the 1970s, airfares were set by the government, so airlines competed\non the basis of amenities. (In 1977, the syndicated columnist George F. Will\nreflected on his preference for United Airlines because it offered macadamia\nnuts instead of peanuts. \u201cThe macadamia nut is one of God\u2019s more successful\nefforts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt has a cachet that the pedestrian peanut cannot\nmatch.\u201d) That changed with the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which\npreceded decades of \u201cfare wars.\u201d Discount carriers like People Express were\nsoon undercutting the legacy airlines and encroaching on their routes. This\nforced the old-timers to revamp their pricing practices.\n\nIn his book Revenue Management: Hard-Core Tactics for Market Domination, the\npricing consultant Robert Cross recalls watching a Delta employee hand out\ndiscounts for the last empty seats on a flight in the early 1980s. Cross knew\nthe plane would fill up with business travelers at the last minute, so he\nsuggested holding those seats and charging a higher fare. This idea\u2014selling\nseats for a lower price if you book early and a higher price later\u2014transformed\nthe airline industry, and saved the legacy airlines.\n\nGanesh Sitaraman: Airlines are just banks now\n\nFrom there, the field of revenue management, or adjusting price and\navailability based on real-time shifts in supply and demand, boomed.\nMultitiered pricing spread to airline-adjacent industries like hotels and\ncruise lines, and then beyond to telecoms, manufacturing, and freight.\nCompanies adopted sophisticated software to track real-time supply and demand,\nand started hiring pricing consultants or even in-house pricers.\n\nThe internet, as you may have heard, changed everything. Consumer advocates\nhailed it as the great leveler, predicting that online shopping would\nfacilitate price comparison and push prices down. Like many early forecasts\nabout the internet, this one looks painfully naive in hindsight. Companies\nwasted little time making it harder for customers to compare prices. In 2004,\nthe MIT economists Glenn and Sara Fisher Ellison found that online vendors\nwere advertising the cheapest version of a product, then steering customers\ntoward a pricier one. Websites also learned to block web crawlers that allowed\ntheir competitors to detect price changes.\n\nOne of the more powerful forms of price obfuscation was the fee. Retail\nplatforms often listed products in order of price. \u201cSo, of course, certain\nretailers realized they could charge one cent for a video camcorder, and\nshipping would be $250,\u201d Sara Fisher Ellison told me. Fees were often obscured\nuntil the end of a transaction\u2014a practice dubbed \u201cdrip pricing.\u201d\n\nThe airlines, having pioneered the use of dynamic pricing, now refined the art\nof the fee. In 2008, American Airlines began charging $15 for checked luggage.\nThe practice spread and soon became a major driver of airline profits. In\n2023, the airlines raked in $33 billion from baggage fees, and even more from\nother ancillary fees like seat selection, meals, and in-flight Wi-Fi. These\nadd-on fees drove down the prices that were displayed to customers, thus\nmaking the offerings look more competitive. It was a win-win arrangement, with\nboth wins going to the airlines.\n\nThe rest of the travel and events industry followed suit. Mysterious \u201cresort\nfees\u201d appeared on hotel bills. Car renters burned time poring over \u201cfacility\nfees,\u201d transponder fees, and third-party insurance. Ticketing websites charged\nmarkups as high as 78 percent for concerts. Some fees sounded like jokes. In\n2014, an airport in Venezuela charged customers a fee to cover its ventilation\nsystem, a surcharge widely mocked as a \u201cbreathing tax.\u201d And fees mingled with\nthe broader trend of digitization-enabled unbundling. Want to \u201cunlock\u201d your\nTesla\u2019s full battery life? In 2016, that cost an extra $3,250.\n\nIf the rise of the fee broke the expectation that prices are transparent,\ndynamic pricing challenged the assumption that they\u2019re fixed. When Uber rolled\nout surge pricing in the 2010s, the company billed it as a way to lure more\ndrivers when demand was high. But the phrase was perhaps too honest. It evoked\na sudden price increase in response to extreme circumstances, and riders\naccused the company of gouging during emergencies. \u201cIt\u2019s a term I tried to\nstamp out when I was at Uber,\u201d said Robert Phillips, a pricing expert who\nworked there for almost two years. \u201cIt sounds like a digestive problem\u2014I\u2019ve\ngot a little surge going on.\u201d\n\nAt least old-school dynamic pricing applies equally to everyone at a given\nmoment. That\u2019s not the case with personalized pricing, which is made possible\nby the explosion of customer data available to firms. Everyone knows that\ncompanies use our data to target ads and decide which products we see. But the\nuse of that data to set prices\u2014to charge each person a different amount based\non their calculated willingness to pay\u2014is still taboo.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. Back in 2015, for example, The Princeton\nReview was caught charging higher prices to students who lived in zip codes\nwith large Asian populations. Since then, the data that can be used to\ncustomize prices have become more fine-grained. Why do you think every brand\nsuddenly has an app? Because if you download the Starbucks app, say, the\ncompany can access your address book, financial information, browsing history,\npurchase history, location\u2014not just where you live, but everywhere you go\u2014and\n\u201caudio information\u201d (if you use their voice-ordering function). All those data\npoints can be fed into machine-learning algorithms to generate a portrait of\nyou and your willingness to pay. In return, you get occasional discounts and a\nfree drink on your birthday.\n\n\u201cOften, personalized pricing is embedded as part of a loyalty program,\u201d Jamie\nWilkie, a partner at McKinsey & Company who advises consumer and retail firms,\ntold me. \u201cIf there\u2019s a high-value customer who\u2019s price sensitive, you may be\nable to give them a personalized offer. If they\u2019re a lower-value customer, you\nmay just want to reach out to them.\u201d The New York Times recently reported that\nairlines\u2014of course\u2014are migrating to a ticket-sales platform that allows them\nto target consumers \u201cwith personalized fares or bundled offers not available\nin the traditional systems.\u201d\n\nPerhaps you don\u2019t like the idea of being designated a lower-value customer,\nand missing out on the best deals as a result. Perhaps you don\u2019t want\ncompanies calculating the precise amount of money they can squeeze out of you\nbased on your personal data or a surge in demand. That\u2019s a perfectly natural\nway to feel. Unless, that is, you\u2019re an economist.\n\nIn a classic 1986 study, researchers posed the following hypothetical to a\nrandom sample of people: \u201cA hardware store has been selling snow shovels for\n$15. The morning after a large snowstorm, the store raises the price to $20.\u201d\nEighty-two percent said this would be unfair.\n\nCompare that with a 2012 poll that asked a group of leading economists about a\nproposed Connecticut law that would prohibit charging \u201cunconscionably\nexcessive\u201d prices during a \u201csevere weather event emergency.\u201d Only three out of\n32 economists said the law should pass. Much more typical was the response of\nMIT\u2019s David Autor, who wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s generally efficient to use the price\nmechanism to allocate scarce goods, e.g., umbrellas on a rainy day. Banning\nthis is unwise.\u201d\n\nThe gap between economists and normies on this issue is huge. To regular\npeople, raising the price of something precisely when we need it the most is\nthe definition of predatory behavior. To an economist, it is the height of\nrationality: a signal to the market to produce more of the good or service,\nand a way to ensure that whoever needs it the most can pay to get it. Jean-\nPierre Dub\u00e9, a professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth\nSchool of Business, told me the public reaction to the Wendy\u2019s announcement\namounted to \u201chysteria,\u201d and that most people would support dynamic pricing if\nonly they understood it. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious,\u201d he said: If Wendy\u2019s has the option\nto raise their prices when demand is high, then customers can also benefit\nfrom lower prices when demand is low.\n\nRead: How money became the measure of everything\n\nEconomists think about this situation in terms of rationing. You can ration a\nscarce resource in one of two ways: by price or by time. Rationing by\ntime\u2014that is, first come, first served\u2014means long lines during periods of high\ndemand, which inconvenience everyone. Economists prefer rationing by price:\nWhoever is willing to pay more during peak hours gets access to the product.\nAccording to Dub\u00e9, that can benefit rich people, but it can also benefit\npeople with greater need, like someone taking an Uber to the hospital. You can\nfind academic studies concluding that Uber\u2019s surge pricing actually leaves\nconsumers better off.\n\nWhen you think about it, though, dynamic pricing is a pretty crude way to\nmatch supply and demand. What you really want is to know exactly how much each\ncustomer is willing to pay, and then charge them that\u2014which is why\npersonalized pricing is the holy grail of modern revenue management. To an\neconomist, \u201cperfect price discrimination,\u201d which means charging everyone\nexactly what they\u2019re willing to pay, maximizes total surplus, the economist\u2019s\nmeasure of goodness. In a world of perfect price discrimination, everyone is\nspending the most money, and selling the most stuff, of all possible worlds.\nIt just so happens that under those conditions, the entirety of the surplus\ngoes to the company.\n\nEconomists I spoke with pointed out that perfect price discrimination is all\nbut impossible in real life. But technology-enabled personalized pricing is\npulling us in that direction. Adam Elmachtoub, an associate professor of\nengineering at Columbia who studies pricing and fairness (he also works for\nAmazon), told me that personalization can be good or bad for consumers,\ndepending on how you apply it. \u201cI think we can agree that if personalized\npricing worked in a way that people with lower incomes got lower prices, we\u2019d\nbe happy,\u201d he said. \u201cOr we\u2019d say it\u2019s not evil.\u201d\n\nElmachtoub pointed to the example of university tuition. By offering financial\naid to different groups, universities engage in personalized pricing for the\npurpose of creating a diverse student body. \u201cWe agree it\u2019s a good idea in this\nsetting,\u201d he said. Likewise, he noted, it\u2019s good that drug companies can sell\nmedications for lower prices in poor countries.\n\nDub\u00e9 argues that personalized pricing should benefit the poor overall, since,\nin theory, people with less money would exhibit lower willingness to pay. \u201cBy\nand large, when you personalize prices, the lowest-income consumers are\ngetting the lowest prices,\u201d he told me. Plus, he pointed out, there\u2019s another,\nless controversial term for personalized pricing: negotiation. Consumers pay a\npersonalized price every time they buy a car from a salesperson, who\u2019s likely\nsizing them up based on the car they already drive, what they\u2019re wearing, how\nthey talk, and other factors. Data-driven personalized pricing merely\nautomates that process, turning more and more transactions into miniature\nversions of going to a car dealership. Which, again, economists seem to\nbelieve is a point in its favor.\n\nMost economists, but not all.\n\nIn a 2014 survey, prominent economists were asked whether they agreed or\ndisagreed that surge pricing like Uber\u2019s \u201craises consumer welfare\u201d by boosting\nsupply and allocating rides more efficiently. Out of 46 economists, only two\ndisagreed. (Four were uncertain, and one had no opinion.)\n\nOne of those two was Angus Deaton, a Princeton economist who won the Nobel\nPrize in 2015 for his work on poverty, and who in recent years has publicly\nquestioned the way his discipline looks at the world. Deaton argues that when\nit comes to pricing, economists are too focused on maximizing efficiency,\nwithout taking fairness into account. In a world of scarce resources, perhaps\nrationing by time is fairer than rationing by price. We all have different\namounts of money, after all, whereas time is evenly distributed. Then there\u2019s\nthe way economists decide what\u2019s good. The mainstream economist thinks that\nthe best policy is the one that maximizes total economic surplus, no matter\nwho gets it. If that benefits some people (companies) at the expense of others\n(consumers), the government can compensate the latter group through transfer\npayments. \u201cA lot of free marketers say you can tax the gainers and give it to\nthe losers,\u201d Deaton says. \u201cBut somehow, miraculously, that never seems to\nhappen.\u201d\n\nIn other words, economics doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to power. In the real\nworld, corporations and consumers are rarely on equal footing. The more\ncomplex and opaque prices get, the more power shifts from buyer to seller.\nThis helps explain why, in practice, poor people are often charged more than\nrich people for the same product or service. The poor pay higher rates for\nmortgages, bank loans, and other financial services. Wealthy Americans pay\nless on average for broadband internet. Neighborhoods with fewer grocery\nstores often have higher prices.\n\nOr take Elmachtoub\u2019s example of college tuition. Yes, poor students who get a\nfree ride thanks to financial aid benefit from personalized pricing. But\ncolleges also collaborate with a thriving \u201cenrollment management\u201d industry\nthat bases financial-aid offers not on students\u2019 need, but on how much an\nalgorithm suggests they and their parents will be willing to pay. This can\nhave perverse effects. As the higher-education expert Kevin Carey wrote for\nSlate in 2022, \u201cparents of means who themselves have finished college are\noften sophisticated consumers of higher education and are able to drive a hard\nbargain, whereas lower-income, less-educated parents feel an enormous\nobligation to help their children move farther up the socioeconomic ladder and\nblindly trust that colleges have their best financial interests at heart.\u201d\nAccordingly, many colleges offer more money to wealthier admitted students\nthan they do to poorer ones.\n\nThe concept of willingness to pay contains endless potential for mischief. \u201cI\nworry about a hotel website knowing that you absolutely must travel to get to\na funeral that has recently been scheduled, or a situation where your kid\nurgently needs some medicine or supplies,\u201d Rohit Chopra, the director of the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and former FTC commissioner, told me.\nImprovements in AI technology make that process even easier and more opaque.\nWhen a bank denies you a loan, it has to provide a reason, Chopra pointed out.\nBut with AI-based pricing, there\u2019s no such transparency, as algorithms make\npricing decisions that humans can\u2019t understand.\n\nAccording to Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School who helped lead\nantitrust efforts as a special assistant to President Joe Biden, opacity is\nthe point. The explosion of complex revenue-management schemes allows\ncompanies to increase their margins by innovating on pricing, rather than by\nimproving their products or service. The closer we get to personalized\npricing, Wu told me, the more we inhabit a world in which \u201ceverything in life\nis like paying for beer at the Super Bowl: Everything\u2019s at your maximum\nwillingness to pay.\u201d There\u2019s a joy\u2014or, in economic terms, a utility\u2014in paying\nless for something than you might have. \u201cIn that model,\u201d Wu said, \u201cyou get\nnone of it.\u201d\n\nIs there any way to reverse the march toward ever-more-vampiric pricing\nschemes?\n\nTackling junk fees is the low-hanging fruit. Most people, including\neconomists, agree that companies should not charge fees that don\u2019t correspond\nto actual services, especially when those fees are hidden or disguised. Even\nthe CATO Institute, the libertarian think tank that never saw a regulation it\nliked, acknowledges that consumers \u201cshouldn\u2019t be charged for products without\ntheir consent, and businesses should disclose mandatory fees before purchases\nare made.\u201d (It still opposes the Biden administration\u2019s anti-junk-fee\ninitiative, which it calls \u201cincoherent\u201d and overbroad.)\n\nThe problem is that the incentives are too powerful for companies to resist on\ntheir own. In 2014, StubHub switched to an \u201call-in\u201d pricing model, in which\ncustomers saw full ticket prices up front. Revenues went down, so they\nswitched back. \u201cThere\u2019s a collective-action problem,\u201d says Shelle Santana,\nassistant professor of marketing at Bentley University, who has studied drip\npricing. If one company refuses to switch to all-in pricing, it can undercut\nthe rest.\n\nRead: Hotel booking is a post-truth nightmare\n\nSuch a clear, popular case for government intervention is rare, and the Biden\nadministration has pounced. New rules and guidances have poured out of the\nFTC, the CFPB, and the White House over the past year, capping late fees for\ncredit cards and limiting surprise charges at car dealerships, among other\nmeasures. Biden mentioned fees four times in his recent State of the Union.\n\nBut industry groups are pushing back. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says the\ncrackdown will make inflation worse by increasing compliance costs. (In other\nwords, the costs of not charging excessive fees will be higher than charging\nexcessive fees.) A lobbyist for the major airlines said the new transparency\nrules around add-on fees would cause \u201cconfusion and frustration\u201d for\ncustomers. Live Nation, the company that owns Ticketmaster, promised to\ndisplay the full cost of tickets up front for events at venues that it\ncontrols, but it has drawn criticism for not extending that policy to cover\nall events for which it sells tickets. Credit-card issuers are resisting\nlimits on late fees, saying they\u2019d be forced to reduce rewards for other\ncustomers, and Republicans in both chambers oppose the cap. Court battles\ncould drag on for years.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the easy stuff. \u201cThe next frontier is going to be price,\u201d Samuel\nLevine, the FTC\u2019s director of consumer protection, told me. \u201cBecause that\u2019s\nthe dream, if companies can actually set personalized prices to maximize\nprofits.\u201d\n\nUltimately, preventing the dystopia of perfect price discrimination\u2014or some\nmore realistic approximation of it\u2014means cutting off companies\u2019 access to the\ndata they use to determine how much to charge us. This isn\u2019t complicated; it\u2019s\njust a politically heavy lift. Getting Americans fired up about their personal\ndata has been notoriously difficult, which helps explain why we still have no\nfederal digital-privacy law. Perhaps if more voters understood that strong\nprivacy protections would also protect them from price discrimination,\nCongress would feel more pressure to get something done. (A glimmer of hope\nappeared earlier this month when lawmakers announced a bipartisan bill that\nwould limit the user data that companies can collect.)\n\nNear-term solutions might depend on the companies themselves. If prices become\ntoo complex, that creates an opening for a firm to commit itself to clear,\nsimple pricing, Bentley University\u2019s Shelle Santana says. For example,\nSouthwest Airlines allows two free checked bags. Mark Cuban\u2019s pharmaceutical\nwholesaler, Cost Plus Drugs, markets itself as a transparent alternative to\nthe usual stress of buying medicine. Boring Mattress Co. promises to help\ncustomers \u201cescape mattress hell\u201d by offering a simple flat-rate mattress with\nfree shipping. Santana cited JetBlue\u2019s early marketing. \u201cTheir whole campaign\nwas, We like our customers,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a flier, you\u2019re like, You don\u2019t\neven have to love me. Just don\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m in hell.\u201d In a world of\nconstantly shuffling prices, could predictability become a competitive\nadvantage?\n\nWendy\u2019s might already be on it. A week after the dynamic-pricing flap, the\nchain announced that it would offer $1 burgers to celebrate March Madness. All\nyou had to do was download the Wendy\u2019s app.\n\nSupport for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett\nFoundation.\n\nChristopher Beam is a writing fellow at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
