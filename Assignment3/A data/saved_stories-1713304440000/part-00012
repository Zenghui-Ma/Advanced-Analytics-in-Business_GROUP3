They could also face jail if the\nimage is shared more widely.\n\nThe creation of a deepfake image will be an offence regardless of whether the\ncreator intended to share it, the department said. The Online Safety Act,\nintroduced last year, has already criminalised the sharing of deepfake\nintimate images, whose creation is being facilitated by advances in artificial\nintelligence.\n\nNearly 4,000 celebrities found to be victims of deepfake pornography\n\nRead more\n\nThe offence will be introduced through an amendment to the criminal justice\nbill, which is making its way through parliament. Laura Farris, the minister\nfor victims and safeguarding, said the creation of deepfake sexual images was\n\u201cunacceptable irrespective of whether the image is shared\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is another example of ways in which certain people seek to degrade and\ndehumanise others \u2013 especially women. And it has the capacity to cause\ncatastrophic consequences if the material is shared more widely. This\ngovernment will not tolerate it.\n\n\u201cThis new offence sends a crystal clear message that making this material is\nimmoral, often misogynistic, and a crime.\u201d\n\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, supported the announcement, saying:\n\u201cIt\u2019s welcome that the government has accepted Labour\u2019s calls to criminalise\nthe creation of deepfake pornography. Superimposing somebody\u2019s image on to\nsexually explicit photos and videos is a gross violation of their autonomy and\nprivacy, which can cause enormous harm, and it must not be tolerated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential that the police and prosecutors are equipped with the training\nand tools required to rigorously enforce these laws in order to stop\nperpetrators from acting with impunity.\u201d\n\nDeborah Joseph, the editor-in-chief of Glamour UK, welcomed the planned\namendment.\n\n\u201cIn a recent Glamour survey, we found 91% of our readers believe deepfake\ntechnology poses a threat to the safety of women, and from hearing personal\nstories from victims, we also know how serious the impact can be,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhile this is an important first step, there is still a long way to go before\nwomen will truly feel safe from this horrendous activity.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Deepfake\n  * UK criminal justice\n  * Online abuse\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
