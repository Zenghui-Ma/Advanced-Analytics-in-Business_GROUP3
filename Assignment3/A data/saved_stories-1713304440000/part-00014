Cohen? Really? And to think so many commentators tried to initially\nblame Muslims.\"\n\nThe actual attacker, shot dead by police, was later identified as Joel Cauchi,\n40. The authorities say his actions were most probably related to his mental\nhealth.\n\nWithin hours of Mr Boikov's post on X, the false claims he amplified had\nreached hundreds of thousands of people on X and Telegram, and had even been\nrepeated by a national news outlet.\n\nI tracked him down because I want to understand how his posts triggered an\nonline frenzy that reached the mainstream media - with serious consequences\nfor Mr Cohen, who's described his distress at being accused of an attack he\nhad nothing to do with.\n\nMr Boikov is speaking to me from the Russian consulate in Sydney, to where he\nfled more than a year ago after a warrant was issued over his arrest for\nalleged assault. The pro-Kremlin social media personality was granted Russian\ncitizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin last year - and has requested\npolitical asylum in Russia.\n\nHe wasn't the first user to mention the name Benjamin Cohen. It appeared to\noriginate on a small account sharing almost exclusively anti-Israel content.\n\nThis is one of the ways disinformation now spreads.\n\nDigital disinformation expert Marc Owen-Jones says: \"It's less obvious and\nsuspicious than if an influential and known partisan account was to initially\ntweet it.\n\n\"Then more established accounts can use this 'seeded' narrative as if it's a\nlegitimate vox pop, and claim they are just 'reporting' what's being said\nonline.\"\n\nThere were also other larger accounts suggesting the attack was somehow\nconnected to Israel or Gaza - before Aussie Cossack's posts on X.\n\nBut his were the first featuring Mr Cohen's name to go viral.\n\nThat's likely because he had purchased a blue tick, meaning his content was\nprioritised ahead of other users and appeared higher up on people's feeds,\nincluding users who did not follow him.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPM Anthony Albanese and NSW Premier Chris Minns (both centre) were among those\nlaying flowers\n\nThe initial post racked up more than 400,000 views, according to X's own data\n- before police identified the attacker as Cauchi, not Benjamin Cohen. Aussie\nCossack followed up with another post on X with the likeness of a video\nshowing the actual attacker, Cauchi, side by side with a picture of Mr Cohen.\n\nOn Telegram, he also posted a screengrab of Mr Cohen's LinkedIn page,\nrevealing where he worked and studied.\n\nBut speaking to me, Mr Boikov stresses the scepticism in his tweet - he says\nhe was the \"first large platform to warn this is unconfirmed\".\n\nHe suggests he pointed out the unconfirmed nature of the claim to \"the\nhundreds of thousands of people who saw my posts\".\n\nHowever, comments from lots of users online in response to his posts suggest\nthey viewed it the opposite way, and assumed Mr Cohen was the attacker.\n\nI challenged Mr Boikov on how his posts had amplified false claims to hundreds\nof thousands of people, causing serious harm to the student at its centre.\nThis came as families were - and still are - grieving for loved ones killed in\nthe attack.\n\n\"Sorry, love, you're doing that right now,\" he said. \"What you're doing now is\nyou are talking about the speculation of a false claim, and you're writing a\nstory about it.\"\n\n## Share in revenue\n\nMr Boikov's is one of hundreds of very active accounts on X with blue ticks\nnow regularly sharing content in this way - whether or not it's true.\n\nUnder X's new guidelines - since Elon Musk bought the social media company -\nusers can receive a \"share of the revenue\" generated by ads from their posts,\nif they purchase a blue tick.\n\nAussie Cossack's posts were picked up and re-circulated by dozens of other\naccounts, including several with a track record of sharing false claims.\nSeveral regularly share content critical of Israel or content relating to the\nwar in Gaza.\n\nThese false accusations soon bled on to other social media platforms.\n\n\"Benjamin Cohen\" was the search option suggested on several videos of the\nattack by TikTok when I was looking through content related to the stabbing on\nSaturday night.\n\nScrolling through these clips, I found the comments were littered with his\nname before the police had confirmed the real identity of the attacker.\n\n\"The attacker's name is Benjamin Cohen IDF Soldier,\" one user wrote. Their\naccount had no posts, and no profile picture. I sent a message. No response.\n\n\"Shame he's a Jew right? Why don't the media outlets label him?\" another\naccount wrote on a video showing people running through the mall. As soon as I\nmessaged this one asking about its comments, it blocked me.\n\n## Repeated by news channel\n\nIt's hard to confirm definitively where these accounts are based. They have\nthe hallmarks of inauthentic profiles, without any identifying features and\nsharing divisive comments repeatedly.\n\nX, Telegram and TikTok have not yet replied to the BBC's requests for comment.\n\nWorryingly, the speculation was picked up by Australian media outlet 7News,\nwhich named Benjamin Cohen as the \"40-year-old lone wolf attacker\".\nScreengrabs of their report further fuelled the wildfire online.\n\n7News later retracted the report and apologised, attributing it to \"human\nerror\".\n\nBut by this point, antisemitic threats were being directed at Benjamin Cohen,\nwho has described the incident as \"highly distressing and disappointing to\nmyself and my family\". He has expressed shock not only that he was falsely\naccused repeatedly on social media, but that even a major news network had\nidentified him.\n\nWhile the social media frenzy was unfolding, his dad Mark Cohen defended his\nson on X. He called on New South Wales Police to reveal the name of the\nattacker \"before this nonsense claiming it was my son causes more harm\".\n\nX\n\nIn parallel, false claims were circulating that the attacker was Muslim. These\nwere shared by prominent journalists and political accounts on X with hundreds\nof thousands of followers from the UK to the US.\n\nBritish journalist and presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer suggested the stabbings\nwere \"another terror attack by another Islamist terrorist\", while TV presenter\nRachel Riley said it was part of a \"Global Intifada\". They both later\nretracted their posts.\n\nHartley-Brewer posted that she had been \"incorrect\" and that the Sydney\nmassacre \"was not an Islamist terror attack\", while Riley said she was \"sorry\"\nif her message had been \"misunderstood\".\n\nDozens of accounts on TikTok also spread false claims that the attacker was\nMuslim. I messaged several of them - but they haven't responded.\n\nNew South Wales Police have suggested the real attacker, Cauchi, deliberately\ntargeted women - who make up five out of six of the victims.\n\nSeveral online forums dedicated to incels - a subculture who define themselves\nas unable to get a sexual partner, despite desiring one - have praised Cauchi\nas one of their own for the attack.\n\nBut so far there's no concrete evidence of Cauchi being involved directly with\nthese online movements. When asked why Cauchi could have targeted women, his\nfather said that his son had \"wanted a girlfriend\" and that had had \"no social\nskills and was frustrated out of his brain\".\n\nIncreasingly, attacks in the real world are being followed by this kind of\nsocial media frenzy - where misinformation is hugely amplified.\n\nFor the families and friends of those who have been killed, and the innocent\nbystanders falsely accused, this toxic rumour-mill is causing serious harm.\n\nIslamophobia\n\nSydney attack\n\nRussia\n\nDisinformation\n\nAntisemitism\n\nSydney\n\nAustralia\n\nRelated\n\n## Ex-Tory councillor discriminated against, report says\n\n16 Mar 2024\n\nUK Politics\n\n## \u00a3117m to protect mosques and Muslim schools\n\n11 Mar 2024\n\nUK\n\n## Defaced Israel-Gaza peace mural painted over by TfL\n\n5 Mar 2024\n\nLondon\n\nMore\n\n4 hrs ago\n\n## Baby hurt in Sydney stabbing out of intensive care\n\nThe daughter of Ashlee Good, who died protecting her, is one of six people\nstill in hospital.\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\n4 hrs ago\n\n## Sydney church stabbing was 'terrorist' attack, police say\n\nA 16-year-old boy is under arrest after a bishop and several churchgoers were\ninjured on Monday.\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\n6 hrs ago\n\n## Maxwell takes mental & physical health break at IPL\n\nAustralia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell opts to take an indefinite \"mental and\nphysical health break\" during the Indian Premier League.\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nCricket\n\n6 hrs ago\n\n## 'Colossal' floods heading for Russian city\n\nThe regional governor of Kurgan says water levels are nearly double those of\nthe last major flood in 1994.\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\n7 hrs ago\n\n## Hero who confronted stabber promised Australia visa\n\nThe prime minister has told \"Bollard Man\" Damien Guerot he can stay in the\ncountry as long as he likes.\n\n7 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
