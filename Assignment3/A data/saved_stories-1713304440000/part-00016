Not only that there are 200+\npractice questions, each with multiple solutions from senior front end\nengineers, there are also automated test case suites to help you identify\nwhat's wrong with your code. Thus, check out the following resources:\n\n  * Study plans help you prepare for your upcoming technical interviews, whether it is in a week or 3 months later.\n  * Focus areas allow you to focus on your weak areas and also further improve your strengths depending on your preferences.\n  * Preparation by stage prepares you for each phase of your interview process, from quiz to coding interviews.\n  * Individual framework questions offer training based on specific frameworks that may be tested during your technical interviews.\n\n### Need to practice front end interview questions?
