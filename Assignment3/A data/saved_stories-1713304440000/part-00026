Enroll in Quantization Fundamentals With Hugging Face\n\nStart Learning\n\n### Short Course\n\n# Quantization Fundamentals with Hugging Face\n\nEnroll for Free\n\nIn Collaboration With\n\nBeginner\n\n1 Hour\n\nYounes Belkada Marc Sun\n\n  * Learn how to compress models with the Hugging Face Transformers library and the Quanto library.\n\n  * Learn about linear quantization, a simple yet effective method for compressing models.\n\n  * Practice quantizing open source multimodal and language models.\n\nEnroll for Free\n\n## What you\u2019ll learn in this course\n\nGenerative AI models, like large language models, often exceed the\ncapabilities of consumer-grade hardware and are expensive to run. Compressing\nmodels through methods such as quantization makes them more efficient, faster,\nand accessible. This allows them to run on a wide variety of devices,\nincluding smartphones, personal computers, and edge devices, and minimizes\nperformance degradation.\n\nJoin this course to:\n\n  * Quantize any open source model with linear quantization using the Quanto library.\n  * Get an overview of how linear quantization is implemented. This form of quantization can be applied to compress any model, including LLMs, vision models, etc.\n  * Apply \u201cdowncasting,\u201d another form of quantization, with the Transformers library, which enables you to load models in about half their normal size in the BFloat16 data type.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have a foundation in quantization\ntechniques and be able to apply them to compress and optimize your own\ngenerative AI models, making them more accessible and efficient.\n\n## Who should join?\n\nThis is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of quantization for\nlearners with a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and some\nexperience with PyTorch, who is interested in learning about model\nquantization in generative AI.\n\n## Instructors\n\n### Younes Belkada\n\nInstructor\n\nMachine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face\n\n### Marc Sun\n\nInstructor\n\nMachine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face\n\n## Course access is free for a limited time during the DeepLearning.AI\nlearning platform beta!\n\nEnroll for Free\n\n## Want to learn more about Generative AI?\n\nKeep learning with updates on curated AI news, courses, and events, as well as\nAndrew\u2019s thoughts from DeepLearning.AI!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
