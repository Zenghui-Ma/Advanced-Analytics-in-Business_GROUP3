For the book series, see Starshield (fiction).\n\nStarshield is a SpaceX program consisting of purpose-built low-Earth orbit\nsatellites designed to provide military space capabilities to U.S. and allied\ngovernments.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4] Starshield was adapted from the global\ncommunications network Starlink but brings additional capabilities such as\ntarget tracking, optical and radio reconnaissance, early missile warning, and\npotential future lethal payloads such as missile interceptors.^[5]^[6]^[7]^[8]\nPrimary customers include the Space Development Agency, National\nReconnaissance Office and the United States Space Force.^[5]^[9]^[10]\n\nWhile SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell has indicated there is little information she\nis allowed to disclose about Starshield, she has noted \"very good\ncollaboration\" between the intelligence community and SpaceX on the\nprogram.^[1] The Starshield website says it has an initial focus on three\nareas; Earth observation, communications and hosted payloads.^[11] In\naddition, Shotwell told the Air Force that SpaceX is not opposed to including\nspace-based weapons \"for the defense of [the United States]\".^[12] Key leaders\nin the Trump Administration have called for these capabilities, reminiscent of\nthe Strategic Defense Initiative.^[13]^[14]^[8]^[6]^[7] The Wall Street\nJournal reported that Starshield's online job postings required people with\ntop-secret clearances, as well as experience working with the Defense\nDepartment and intelligence community \u2014 such as representing Starshield to\nPentagon combatant commands.^[1]\n\nThe program is led by former four-star general Terrence O'Shaughnessy who\npreviously ran U.S. Northern Command and focused on issues in homeland missile\ndefense. According to O'Shaughnessy, the Starshield constellation will be have\na \"couple hundreds\" satellites, compared to Starlink's thousands.^[1]\n\nThe first satellites were designed for the Space Development Agency and\noutfitted with advanced thermal imaging cameras meant to provide target-grade\ntracking of ballistic and hypersonic missiles.^[15] In 2021, Starshield had\nentered a $1.8 billion classified contract with the U.S. government, revealed\nin 2023,^[1] to construct hundreds of spy satellites for continuous real time\nmonitoring of targets around the globe.^[9]\n\n## History[edit]\n\n### Starshield program[edit]\n\nThe Starshield name was publicly announced December 2022,^[16] however in\n2021, Starshield had already entered a $1.8 billion classified contract with\nthe U.S. government, revealed in 2023.^[1] In the documents of the contract,\nSpaceX says that funds from the contract were expected to become an important\npart of the revenue mix of the company after 2021.^[1] Reuters revealed in\n2024 that this contract was between the National Reconnaissance Office and\nSpaceX, and for a spy satellite network consisting of hundreds of satellites\nfunctioning as a swarm.^[9] The satellites will have imaging capabilities and\nthe satellite network will enable the US government to have continuous\nsurveillance of nearly anywhere around the globe.^[9] Starshield also plans to\nbe more resilient to attack from other powers.^[9]\n\nElon Musk and four-star general Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy in April 2019\n\nAs early as 2020, SpaceX was designing, building, and launching customized\nmilitary satellites based on variants of the Starlink satellite bus for the\nSpace Development Agency (SDA). SDA accelerates development of missile defense\ncapabilities using industry-procured low-cost low Earth orbit satellite\nplatforms.^[6] The program was conceived and instituted by Under Secretary of\nDefense (R&E) Michael D. Griffin (who had decades earlier joined Musk on his\ntrip to Russia to examine ICBMs as part of SpaceX's founding).^[17] A few\nmonths after Space Development Agency was announced, SpaceX Chief Operating\nOfficer Gwynne Shotwell was asked by the United States Air Force, given the\nnature of the program, whether SpaceX would launch weapons into space for the\nUS military. She affirmed \"we would if it's for the defense of this\ncountry.\"^[12]\n\nFuture Under Secretary of Defense Research and Engineering Michael D. Griffin\nmeets with Elon Musk and Larry Williams, former VP of Teledesic in 2005.\n\nIn October 2020, SDA awarded SpaceX an initial $150 million dual-use contract\nto develop 4 satellites to detect and track ballistic and hypersonic\nmissiles.^[15] The first batch of satellites were originally scheduled to\nlaunch September 2022 to form part of the Tracking Layer Tranche 0 of the\nSpace Force's National Defense Space Architecture.^[18] The launch schedule\nslipped multiple times but eventually launched in April 2023.^[19]^[20]\n\nThe NDSA will be composed of seven layers with specific functions: data\ntransport, battle management, missile tracking, custody/weapons targeting,\nsatellite navigation, deterrence, and ground support.^[8]^[21] Historically,\nspace-based missile defense concepts were expensive, but reusable launch\nsystems have mitigated costs according to a 2019 Congressional Budget Office\nanalysis.^[22] NDSA leverages existing commercial satellite bus development\nsuch as Starlink to reduce costs, including free-space optical laser terminals\nfor a secure command and control mesh network.^[18] The 2019 Missile Defense\nReview notes space-based sensing enables \"improved tracking and potentially\ntargeting of advanced threats, including HGVs and hypersonic cruise\nmissiles\".^[23] However, the Union of Concerned Scientists warns developments\ncould escalate tensions with Russia and China and called the project\n\"fundamentally destabilizing\".^[24] The Carnegie Endowment for International\nPeace later advocated for a treaty halting development to prevent an arms race\nin space.^[25]\n\nSince 2021, Starlink's military satellite development is overseen internally\nat SpaceX by retired four-star general Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy.^[26]^[27]\nO'Shaughnessy advocated before the United States Senate Committee on Armed\nServices for a layered capability with lethal follow-on that incorporates\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence to gather and act upon sensor\ndata quickly.^[28] Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy reportedly has had a high-level role\nat Starshield.^[1]\n\nSpaceX was not awarded a contract for the larger Tranche 1, with awards going\nto York Space Systems, Lockheed Martin Space, and Northrop Grumman Space\nSystems.^[29]\n\nAs Starlink was being relied on in the Russo-Ukrainian war, expert on\nbattlefield communications Thomas Wellington argued that Starlink signals,\nbecause they use narrow focused beams, are less vulnerable to interference and\njamming by the enemy in wartime than satellites flying in higher orbits.^[30]\n\nAnother Starshield contract was announced in September 2023, involving\ncommunications-focused services for U.S. Space Systems Command.^[31]^[32] This\ncontract with the US Space Force plans to provide customized satellite\ncommunications for the military.^[33] This is under the Space Force's new\n\"Proliferated Low Earth Orbit\" program for LEO satellites, where Space Force\nwill allocate up to $900 million worth of contracts over the next 10 years.\nAlthough 16 vendors are competing for awards, the SpaceX contract is the only\none to have been issued to date.^[31]^[33] The one-year Starshield contract\nwas awarded on September 1, 2023.^[10] The contract is expected to support 54\nmission partners across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.^[10]\n\nIn February 2024, the United States House Select Committee on Strategic\nCompetition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party sent a\nletter to Elon Musk stating that the Starshield program was potentially in\nbreach of contract for not providing access to U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan\nwhen \"global access\" was \"possibly\" required by the contract.^[34]^[35] SpaceX\nresponded that they were in full compliance with their U.S. government\ncontracts. SpaceX had notified the Select Committee a week earlier that they\nwere misinformed, but the Select Committee \"chose to contact media before\nseeking additional information [regarding Starshield military use in\nTaiwan]\".^[36]\n\n## Launches[edit]\n\nBetween 2020 and March 2024, a dozen Starshield prototypes and operational\nsatellites were launched on Falcon 9.^[9] Reuters reported that these\nsatellites have never been acknowledged by SpaceX or the US government and\nremain classified.^[9]\n\nIt is suspected^[by whom?] as per the images,^[37] that the two SpaceX-built\nStarlink derived Space Development Agency Tranche 0 Flight 1 Tracking Layer\ninfrared imaging satellites launched on 2 April 2023 are based on the\nStarshield satellite bus.^[38]^[37] Similar confirmed evidences were found\nduring Starlink Group 7-16 launch when US cataloged only 20 of a 22 starlink\nbatch and designated the next USA satellite launch as 352 and skipped 350 and\n351, that are Starshield satellites.^[39]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from List of Starlink and Starshield launches \u00a7\nStarshield.[edit]\n\nStarshield launches^[40]No.| Mission Name or Designation| Sat.
