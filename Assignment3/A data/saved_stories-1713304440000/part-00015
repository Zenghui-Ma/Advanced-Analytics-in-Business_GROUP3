Those emissions\ncost $9.3 billion annually because of their effects on global warming and air\nquality, the authors estimated.\n\nThe study, published in Nature, used aerial surveys to track methane emissions\nfrom oil and gas fields, pipelines, processing facilities, and more in six\nfossil fuel\u2013producing regions of the United States. It adds to a growing body\nof evidence indicating that methane emissions are far higher than previously\nthought.\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas, often calculated to be 28 times more\npowerful than carbon dioxide (though some studies say it could be even more\npowerful), and is responsible for around a third of human-caused global\nwarming to date.\n\nCurtailing these emissions has been a focus of recent regulatory efforts, such\nas the Global Methane Pledge, signed by more than 150 countries that agreed to\nreduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The U.S. EPA also recently unveiled\nnew rules, set to take effect in May, that aim to cut 58 million tons of\nmethane emissions over the next 15 years.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nHistorically, getting a handle on where methane emissions are coming from has\nproven to be difficult. It\u2019s only in the past decade or so that new\ntechnologies such as ground-based surveys, specialized satellites, and aerial\nsurvey techniques have allowed researchers to begin to pinpoint methane\nsources.\n\nThose efforts were \u201creally eye-opening for the scientific and policy\ncommunity,\u201d said methane data scientist Evan Sherwin from Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory, especially given that the data pointed to a small number\nof very large emitters making up much of the methane released. Sherwin is lead\nauthor of the new paper, which was supported by Stanford University\u2019s\nDepartment of Energy Science and Engineering and funded by the Stanford\nNatural Gas Initiative, which is supported by the fossil fuel industry.\n\n### Getting a Grip on Methane\n\nFor a more comprehensive look at methane emissions, Sherwin and his colleagues\ntook data from 15 aerial surveys completed between 2017 and 2021, covering\nalmost a million oil and gas sites across six regions of the United States.\n\nThe surveys covered just a portion of the country\u2019s onshore oil and gas\nproduction. Even so, the results were striking.\n\nCombining their measurements with estimates from sources too small to be\ndetected from above, the researchers found that the surveyed regions emit\nabout 6.2 million tons of methane per year, or about 3% of total fossil fuel\nproduction from those sites, far more than previously thought. That amounts to\nabout a billion dollars in losses for fossil fuel companies and a large chunk\nof total U.S. methane emissions.\n\n> \u201cOne big takeaway is that this is a pretty solvable problem.\u201d\n\nMost methane emissions came from a small number of sources within the\nproduction and processing supply chain. In California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley,\nfewer than 1% of sites release more than half the measured methane emissions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way more concentrated than we thought,\u201d Sherwin said.\n\nSources of methane emissions include flares that blow out, allowing the gas to\nescape rather than being burned, as well as pressure release valves on oil\ntanks, according to Sherwin. But ultimately, he said, methane escapes during\nevery stage of the oil and gas supply chain. He estimates that about half of\nmethane emissions from oil and gas production come from midstream\ninfrastructure, which includes compressor stations, gas processing plants, and\npipelines.\n\nThough these sources are troubling, they are also likely to be relatively easy\nto fix. \u201cOne big takeaway is that this is a pretty solvable problem, at least\na great chunk of it,\u201d Sherwin said.\n\n### Geography Matters\n\nThe researchers also found big differences in methane release between regions.\nIn the Denver-Julesburg Basin, centered in eastern Colorado, slightly more\nthan 1% of total oil and gas production was released as methane. In the New\nMexico portion of the Permian Basin, methane release rates were almost 10% of\ntotal production. The difference comes down to several factors, such as the\ntype of fossil fuel produced and the productivity of the well site.\n\nThe true magnitude of emissions is likely higher, Sherwin cautioned. The\nresearchers were conservative in their estimates, including the fraction of\nmethane found in oil deposits and the amount of methane released from smaller\nsources.\n\nAnother difficulty in getting an estimate is that many large point sources,\nsuch as blown-out flares, are transient. So surveys taken at two different\ntimes could find varying amounts and sources of methane. Aerial surveys are\nimportant because they can be repeated, Sherwin said.\n\n### Better Methane Data Still Needed\n\nAerial surveys also have their drawbacks, said Ritesh Gautam, an atmospheric\nscientist with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). The aerial survey\nplatform used in the study can\u2019t capture smaller sources (though some others\ncan), he said, meaning aerial-only surveys will miss some emissions.\n\n\u201cFlying over an area or flying over sites does not always mean that you\u2019re\nmeasuring emissions from it,\u201d Gautam said. He added that some recent studies\nindicated that the methods of estimating smaller emissions sources, such as\nthat used by Sherwin and his coauthors, may be underestimating methane\nrelease.\n\n\u201cWhile the study makes an important contribution towards characterizing high-\nemitting point sources, we need more direct measurements and observations for\ncharacterizing the total regional emissions,\u201d Gautam said.\n\nFor a true picture of global methane emissions, scientists will need to\ncombine ground, aerial, and satellite surveys for a more cohesive look, Gautam\nsaid. That could be on the horizon, as new satellites such as EDF\u2019s MethaneSAT\nenter operation and as methane surveys expand.\n\nAction on methane emissions from both the fossil fuel industry and governments\nhas been slow to ramp up, though it\u2019s now gaining momentum. With potential\ngains for both fossil fuel companies and society at large for doing so, the\nincentives may be aligned for real action to take place.\n\n\u2014Nathaniel Scharping (@nathanielscharp), Science Writer\n\n##### Citation: Scharping, N.
