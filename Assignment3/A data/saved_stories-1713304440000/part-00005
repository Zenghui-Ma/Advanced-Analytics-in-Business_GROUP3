Chips, HDDs, and\nWearables.\n\nBas Steins\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bas' Take on Tech: AI \u2013 Are we there, yet?\n\nbasc.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nHowdy,\n\nthanks for reading my tech newsletter about the recent buzz in tech.\n\nHave a great week ahead!\n\n##\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83d\udcbb AI: Are we there, yet?\n\nIs it already time to cite the Hype Cycle with respect to AI and my\npredictions for 2024?\n\nFirst, Texas grades exams with AI, but refuses to call it \u201cAI\u201d. This seems to\nbe the first step to using AI in administrative law. Whether or not, the\ngrading itself is reliable or not, the whole process will for sure trigger\nsome lawsuits.\n\nSecond, Devin, the AI software engineer was debunked. The admittedly\nimpressive demo for the product launch was likely doctored. This acts as a\nreminder that large-language models (LLMs) are just a statistical way of\nrecombining already-known knowledge on a very large scale. Indeed, the scale\nis so large that prices for storage hardware, even for good old HDD have risen\nby 20% since Q3 2023. At the same time, OpenAI continues to crawl the web and\nhas reportedly hit a silly content farm. OpenAI is still trying to expand to\nnew markets like Japan while the excitement about ChatGPT, Copilot and other\ntools seems to be decaying.\n\nThe other part of the AI boom has been computer chips. At least, innovations\nin this space are here to stay. The Bloomberg article about why making\ncomputer chips has become a new global arms race has some valid points.\n\nGoogle continues working on its own \u201cAI\u201d chip. I found it very difficult to\nget my hands on Google Cloud Instances with NVIDIA chips. Maybe that\u2019s why\nthey intensify working on a competitive chip. If Google works on a chip, Meta\nhas to follow, obviously. If they\u2019re using the chip to detect and label AI-\ngenerated content on Facebook?\n\nAnd while Apple continues to be on the bleeding edge of consumer ARM chips\nwith their new iPhone SOC and the upcoming M4 (an \u201cAI chip\u201d, of course),\nMicrosoft still struggles with bringing Windows to ARM \u2013 but they\u2019re at least\nconfident they can beat Apple.\n\nThird, Devin is not the only victim of disappointed expectations: The Apple\nVision Pro is not a hot topic, anymore. Apart from memes with stupid-looking\npeople wearing that headset, I\u2019ve not seen anyone talking about it; and I\u2019ve\nseen the 2 months old device trading on eBay for 50-60% of the purchase price.\nIn fact, owners seem to complain about fitting issues and \u2013 like with Google\nGlasses \u2013 an actual useful \u201ckiller app\u201d is yet to be found.\n\nThe hot kid on the block, the Humane AI Pin, also disappoints. Started with\nbloated expectations, \u201cThe Verge\u201d editors changed their minds about the $700\ndevice with a devastating verdict: \u201cThere\u2019s only one problem: it just doesn\u2019t\nwork.\u201d\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 More headlines\n\n  * Your Plug-In Hybrid Won\u2019t Save the Planet\n\n  * Top 100 Consumer Generative AI apps\n\n  * The State of Generative AI\n\n  * Naval Ravikant\u2019s Airchat is a social app built around talk (btw, find me on AirChat and hit me up for an invite if you like!)\n\n  * Does it still matter to be in the Bay Area? (Hacker News discussion)\n\n  * AI \u2018apocalypse\u2019 could take away almost 8m jobs in UK, says report (unless government \u201ctakes action\u201d)\n\n  * How To Found a Company In Germany: 14 \u201cEasy\u201d Steps And Lots Of Pain\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Tech Pieces\n\n  * An incomplete list of software development metrics\n\n  * If Inheritance is so bad, why does everyone use it?\n\n  * PostgreSQL Index Advisor\n\n##\n\n\ud83e\udd69 Totally Off-Topic\n\nI made this season\u2019s first homemade BBQ sauce!\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\ude80 What else?\n\nI have changed this newsletter from \u201coccasional\u201d to at least once every two\nweeks. The new format not only contains curated news and insights from the\ntech world but also sets the stage for fellow developers.\n\nI will ask people about their journeys in the tech world and also in life. I\u2019m\npretty sure there is much to learn from listening to other people\u2019s\nexperiences, and I am excited to share that with you!\n\nOf course, I need your help with this.\n\nPlease tell me if you want to share your story with my 600+ readers!\n\n  * What is something you learned?\n\n  * What are some books that recently influenced you?\n\n  * What do you want to share with others about your life, your productivity, your career, and your health?\n\nReach out to me on this form.\n\nLet me know how I can make the newsletter better.\n\nI set up a short feedback form here.\n\nIt would mean the world to me if you spent a minute or two filling it out!\n\nBest,\n\nThanks for reading Bas' Take on Tech!
