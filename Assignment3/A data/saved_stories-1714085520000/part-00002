For the full map of posts, see here.\n\nPrimi Quadriui Mysterium \u2014 John Dee (c. 16th century) Public Domain.\n\nThe stars are like letters that inscribe themselves at every moment in the\nsky... Everything in the world is full of signs... All events are coordinated.\n\n\u2014 Plotinus, from Enneads (c. 268 AD)\n\nIn astronomy, geocentrism refers to models and cosmologies that place the\nEarth at the centre of the universe. Geocentric models varied in their precise\nformulation, but they tended to assume that celestial objects \u2014 the Sun, Moon,\nplanets, and stars \u2014 orbited around the Earth, which remained in a fixed\nposition.\n\nThese systems, which predominated Western, Islamic, and Far Eastern\ncosmogonies for centuries, can seem primitive to us now that we know the\ntruth. But we should not be so quick to pass judgement on our predecessors \u2014\nnot least because there\u2019s an excellent chance that something we take for\ngranted in our current understanding of the cosmos will end up being just as\nwrong. Instead, we should recognise that these early models of the universe\nrepresent that very human desire to understand the universe and our place in\nit.\n\nWriting in the 13th century, William of Occam hit upon a profound wisdom when\nhe formulated his philosophical razor \u2014 that the simplest explanation is often\nthe best one. To the greatest minds of his time, a geocentric model remained\nthe most simple explanation. After all, from our earthbound perspective the\nEarth feels entirely stationary, while the Sun and stars move across the sky\nas if they\u2019re rotating around us. Similarly, the stars are so much further\naway from us than they could have ever imagined, so their reasoning that if\nthe Earth did move they\u2019d be able to see evidence of a change in star\npositions, was not so wrongheaded.1\n\nThe ancients believed the movements of celestial objects profoundly influenced\nevents here on Earth. Thus, it was vital that they map the cosmos, tracking\nthe Moon, planets, and star constellations as they arced across the heavens.\nIn doing so, they developed complex mathematics, philosophies, and birthed the\nscience of astronomy.\n\nWhat follows is a short history of geocentrism, and how ancient astronomers in\nBabylon, Greece, and the Roman Empire made sense of their place in the cosmos,\nand how European Christendom adapted these ideas into its theology.2\n\nThe Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, from Kitab-i viladat-i Iskandar, (The Book of\nBirth of Iskandar) (1411) Public Domain.\n\nThough references to celestial omens, star lists, and schemes of daylight\nlength begin to appear in the archaeological record as far back as the 16th\ncentury BC, it was during the 8th and 7th centuries that Babylonians first\ndeveloped an empirical approach to the study of the heavens. Their detailed\nreports on the movements of stars, the phases of the Moon, and eclipses of the\nSun herald the beginnings of human science. In the words of Asger Aaboe, \u201cwe\nclaim Babylonian mathematical astronomy as the common ancestor of modern\nefforts in the exact sciences.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the ancient Babylonians\u2019 work comes down to us in fragments,\nscattered and piecemeal, so we\u2019re not able to fully reconstruct their\ncosmology. However, the c. 7-8th century BC Imago Mundi, the first ever map of\nthe world, suggest the Babylonians viewed the Earth as a flat disc surrounded\nby water.\n\n## This post is for paid subscribers\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
