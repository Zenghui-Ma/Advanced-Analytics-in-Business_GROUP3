Need I say much more? Yeah of course!\n\nThis is a little project I threw together in a couple hours that lets you surf\na completely fake web! You run a search query in the only non-generated page /\nand it generates a search results page with fake links that lead to fake\nwebsites that lead to more fake websites! It's not perfect, not by a long\nshot, but it works well enough for me to spend like an hour just going through\nit and laughing at what it makes.\n\nIf you encounter any issues with the search results page, reload and it'll\ngenerate a new page. If you get any issues with the other generated pages then\ntry make slight adjustments to the URL to get a different page, right now\nthere isn't yet a way to regenerate a page.\n\nAlso when you navigate to the /_export path or kill the server, the JSON of\nyour current internet will be saved to the file internet.json in the root of\nthe project. Right now you can't load it back yet but maybe I'll add that in\nthe future if I want, or you could fork it and add it yourself the code isn't\nvery complicated at all.\n\n## How do I run this???\n\nSimple, first install Ollama here, then pull your model of choice. The one I\nused is Llama 3 8B Instruct which works really well and is very impressive for\nan 8B model. If you don't want to use Ollama you can use any other OpenAI-\ncompatible server by modifying the client declaration in ReaperEngine.py to\nlink to your server, I recommend llama.cpp's server example for something\nlightweight, or text-generation-webui for a fully featured LLM web interface.\n\nDue to popular demand and it not being 12am anymore I finally added a\nrequirements.txt file! Now instead of manually installing dependencies you can\njust run pip install -r requirements.txt in the root of the project and it'll\ninstall them all for you!\n\n(If you want to manually install dependenies, follow these instructions) Next\nyou'll need to install Python if you don't already have it, I run Python\n3.10.12 (came with my Linux Mint install), then the libraries you'll need are:\n\n  * OpenAI\n  * BeautifulSoup4\n  * Flask\n\nOnce those are installed, simply run the main.py file and navigate to\nhttp://127.0.0.1:5000 or whatever URL Flask gives you and have fun!\n\n## Inspiration\n\nI'll admit it, I'm not the most creative person. I got this idea from this\nreddit comment on r/localllama, so thank you very much commenter!\n\n## About\n\nY'all thought the dead internet theory wasn't real, but HERE IT IS\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n62 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n3 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n9 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
