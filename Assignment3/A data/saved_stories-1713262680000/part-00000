Caught up in the heady rave culture that gripped \u201990s\nLondon, he took some acid at a club one night and followed a herd of unknown\nfaces to an afterparty. There, he found himself pursued by a single thought,\nwhich followed him like a hunter\u2019s sights: He was behaving badly, and everyone\nin the room couldn\u2019t stop talking about him. A few months later, he started to\nexperience bouts of panic and social anxiety, neither of which he\u2019d ever felt\nbefore. \u201cI was very worried that I\u2019d damaged my brain, and that it was\npermanent,\u201d Evans recalls. He steered clear of psychedelics. But for the next\nsix years, he suffered from panic attacks, social anxiety, dissociation, and\ndepression, which only cleared after a course of cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nIn 2017, Evans decided to try again. After learning of emerging research that\nsuggested that psychedelics were safe in a guided setting, and in part to\novercome his first traumatic experience, he traveled to a well-reputed retreat\nin Peru to take ayahuasca. Afterward, as he made his way to the Gal\u00e1pagos\nIslands, where he had planned a few days\u2019 peaceful reflection in nature, a\nstrange feeling came over him. \u201cI began to suspect that I was either in a\ndream of my own construction or trapped in some kind of fake reality\nconstructed by someone else,\u201d he wrote in an essay in 2020. \u201cCould I be in a\ncoma or some afterlife limbo state?\u201d The eerie feelings only intensified when\nhe got to the Islands. On the ferry, he was convinced that he was crossing the\nriver Styx into the land of the dead. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real,\u201d he thought to\nhimself. \u201cHow do I wake up?\u201d When concerned friends reached out, he thought\nhis desperate subconsciousness was making them up. \u201cI felt profoundly alone in\nthis fake reality,\u201d he wrote. The ontological nausea faded 10 days later, but\nhis doubts about the safety of psychedelics did not.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In 2021, the National Institutes of\nHealth\u2019s annual \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d study observed that hallucinogen use\nhad hit an all-time high since the first survey was completed in 1988, with\nreported use by United States adults aged 19-30 up to 8 percent. Following two\ndecades of research celebrating the therapeutic potential of psychedelics,\nmany people associate the substances with a range of psychological benefits:\nheightened social connection, reduced anxiety and depression, a deeper sense\nof meaning, and a more powerful connection to the divine or the universe.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nBut amid all the scientific and cultural enthusiasm for these drugs, little\nattention has been paid to bad trips and their after-effects, and even less to\nwhat might alleviate them.\n\nThis is not entirely arbitrary. Bad trips are rare: Surveys indicate that the\nmajority of those who report having taken psychedelics never have a difficult\nor distressing experience, during or after the trip. But for a select few, the\nafter-effects can be quite serious. In one small study of 613 psychedelic\nusers, in the days and weeks following a challenging trip, close to 7 percent\nreported thoughts or attempts of hurting themselves or others, and 3 percent\nsought psychiatric help. Something called Hallucinogen Persisting Perception\nDisorder, flashbacks of visual disturbances that first arose during a\nhallucinogenic trip, is also now recognized by the DSM-V.\n\nAs Evans, now a researcher at the University of London in the Centre for the\nHistory of the Emotions at Queen Mary, began looking into the literature, he\nlearned that the most serious effects may also be vastly underreported in\ntrials involving psychedelics. One review of clinical ketamine use for\ndepression, for example, found that 42 percent of serious adverse events and\n39 percent of non-serious events reported in clinical trials data were not\nreported in the published articles. Some scientists say psychosis risk is also\nunderestimated in the research literature, in part because older reports of it\nled modern psychedelic researchers to exclude participants with a family\nhistory of psychotic spectrum illness from their studies.\n\nEvans decided to launch the \u201cChallenging Psychedelics Project\u201d with a handful\nof colleagues. They posted a survey in the fall of 2022, inviting people who\nhad difficulties for at least a day following a psychedelic trip to\nparticipate. Some 608 individuals from around the world responded over the\nnext few months, answering questions about context of use, the nature and\nduration of the challenges they experienced, plus a range of possible risk\nfactors and perceived causes, and providing written accounts of their\nexperiences. Evans was particularly interested in collecting written\nnarratives about these bad trips, he says, which remain rare in the research\nliterature.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

A majority\u2014about\n75 percent\u2014experienced emotional difficulties, primarily anxiety and fear, but\nalso depression. Almost half struggled with existential confusion and\n\u201cderealization,\u201d the sense that everything was unreal. Others struggled with\nissues relating to self-perception; they were plagued by excessive self-\nconsciousness, or \u201cdepersonalization,\u201d a sense of being so detached from\nthemselves that they viewed their own lives from a near-cinematic remove.\nStill others experienced social difficulties, a sense of disconnection from\nother people, problems with sleep and nightmares, and other physiological\nsymptoms, such as breathing problems or heart issues, compulsive crying,\nexperiences of psychosis. Five respondents experienced prosopagnosia, a\ndifficulty recognizing faces.\n\nFor many of the respondents who took Evans\u2019 survey, the post-trip difficulties\nlingered for months or longer. One respondent wrote that his trip had \u201creset\nhis soul\u201d and left him feeling lonely and disconnected from others for 30\nyears. According to the study respondents, the negative effects were\nexacerbated by a lack of information about what was happening to them, which\nonly increased feelings of anxiety, social disconnection, and existential\nconfusion. More information could save a lot of people from unnecessary\ndistress and psychological harm, says Evans.\n\nSome of the respondents who suffered afterward had taken the drugs as part of\na clinical trial or psychedelic therapy session, around 8 percent. \u201cIt might\nbe surprising to the field, as leading scientists like David Nutt have argued\nthat the risks of extended difficulties in clinical trials are basically\nzero,\u201d says Evans. This finding challenges the \u201cset and setting\u201d hypothesis of\npsychedelics, formulated long ago by pioneering psychology researcher and\npsychedelics champion Timothy Leary. That theory says that psychological\nmindset and environment powerfully influence a drug user\u2019s experience and that\nthe intensity and duration of bad after-effects can be shaped by lack of\npreparedness, negative mindset, or a lack of psychological support. Another\nsurprise: A prior diagnosis of mental illness did not predict the duration or\nvariety of enduring difficulties.\n\nEvans doesn\u2019t advocate against psychedelics. But by exposing the hazards that\ntripping could involve, Evans hopes to temper the prevalent ethos of breezy\noptimism with a dash of caution.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
