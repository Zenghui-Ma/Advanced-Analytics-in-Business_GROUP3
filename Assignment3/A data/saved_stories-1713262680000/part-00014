The atoms in a molecule\n> are first assigned to tetrahedra in groups of four atoms by Delaunay\n> tetrahedrization adapted for efficient GPU implementation and the SASA\n> values for atoms and molecules are calculated based on the tetrahedrization\n> information and inclusion-exclusion method. The SASA values from the\n> numerical icosahedral-based method can be reproduced with more than 98%\n> accuracy for both proteins and RNAs. Having been implemented on GPUs and\n> incorporated into the software Amber, we can apply dSASA to implicit solvent\n> molecular dynamics simulations with inclusion of this nonpolar term. The\n> current GPU version of GB/SA simulations has been accelerated up to nearly\n> 20-fold compared to the CPU version and it outperforms LCPO as the system\n> size increases. The performance and importance of the nonpolar part in\n> implicit solvent modeling are demonstrated in GB/SA simulations of proteins\n> and accurate SASA calculation of nucleic acids.\n\nSubjects:| Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2401.10462 [q-bio.BM]  \n(or arXiv:2401.10462v1 [q-bio.BM] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.10462arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Xin Cao [view email] [v1] Fri, 19 Jan 2024 03:18:04 UTC (3,450 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Exact analytical algorithm for solvent\naccessible surface area and derivatives in implicit solvent molecular\nsimulations on GPUs, by Xin Cao and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nq-bio.BM\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2401\n\nChange to browse by:\n\nq-bio\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
