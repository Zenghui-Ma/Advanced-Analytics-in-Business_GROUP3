Nobody would ever let me implement these ideas\u2014too\nmuch money is at stake.\n\nBut I can dream, can\u2019t I?\n\nI\u2019m sure you have suggestions of your own. Please share them in the comments.\n\n####\n\nIf you want to support my work, the best way is by taking out a premium\nsubscription (for just $6 per month).\n\n###\n\n30 Steps to Revitalize Arts & Culture\n\nSome of these recommendations may seem frivolous or outrageous. Those are the\nones I like best.\n\n###\n\n1.\n\nSuper Bowl halftime should be a musical showcase for the host city. If the\ngame is in New Orleans, let\u2019s see the greatest New Orleans musicians. If the\ngame is in Detroit, let Motown rule.\n\nNew Jersey has dibs on Springsteen. Houston gets Beyonc\u00e9. Minneapolis has\nDylan. If Las Vegas gets the nod, bring out the hippest casino lounge acts in\nSin City.\n\nThe next Super Bowl will be played at the Superdome in New Orleans\n\nMy requirements are as follows: A city can feature any artist who resides or\nwas born within 250 miles of the stadium. Maybe I\u2019ll allow an exception for\nmusicians who lived in the city for at least ten years before moving\nelsewhere.\n\nThis would be so much more exciting than the current fare. Genuine musical\nrivalries would spring up between cities, and residents would learn about\ntheir own local and regional culture.\n\nP.S. If a host city is embarrassed by its paltry music culture, maybe it\nshould do something about it.\n\n###\n\n2.\n\nIf I\u2019m king, I\u2019ll require top executives of dominant music platforms to submit\nto a simple ear and music aptitude test:\n\n  * Can they hum back melodies after hearing them once?\n\n  * Can they play an instrument?\n\n  * Can they identify intervals and basic chords progressions by ear? (Hah!)\n\n  * Can they shake a tambourine without losing the beat?\n\n  * Can they even sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d in tune?\n\n  * Etc. etc.\n\nThere are no penalties\u2014I am a lenient monarch\u2014but the results will be made\npublic. If Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, wants to dominate our music culture, let\u2019s\nsee if he knows bugger all about it.\n\nEven better: Let\u2019s televise this as a competition. It could be the dark twin\nof American Idol\u2014maybe every week, we allow one or two CEOs to exit shamefully\nfrom the competition, but only after demonstrating their incompetence in front\nof a live audience.\n\nAfter a couple of seasons of this, companies will start hiring execs that love\nand know music. That can\u2019t be a bad thing.\n\n###\n\n3.\n\nLet\u2019s launch a National Culture Bee on the model of the National Spelling Bee\nand National History Bee. If students can be rewarded for learning how to\nspell autochthonous, they also deserve to be rewarded for learning about\nnovelists, philosophers, painters, saxophonists, choreographers, composers,\ndramatists, etc.\n\n###\n\n4.\n\nCommunity bookstores that offer at least 10 readings or community cultural\nevents per month will qualify for non-profit status. But these must be real\ncommunity bookstores\u2014majority owned by people living in the community, and\nselling actual books (not jigsaw puzzles, calendars, greeting cards, etc.).\n\n###\n\n5.\n\nAll Grammy Awards will be decided by a small group of elite judges\u2014no more\nthan 100 or 200 of the greatest living musicians. I\u2019m talking about people on\nthe level of Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Stevie Wonder, etc. No industry\nshills allowed!\n\nThe awards would immediately gain enormous credibility. Fans would pay\nattention to the winners.\n\nAlso, getting named a judge would become a huge honor\u2014even bigger than winning\na Grammy itself. New judges are chosen by the existing judges, who can only\nfill vacancies based on retirement or death.\n\n###\n\n6.\n\nDo the same for movies, books, etc. The only way to fix the dying awards is to\nentrust judges who have total respect and personal authority.\n\n## Keep reading with a 7-day free trial\n\nSubscribe to The Honest Broker to keep reading this post and get 7 days of\nfree access to the full post archives.\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
