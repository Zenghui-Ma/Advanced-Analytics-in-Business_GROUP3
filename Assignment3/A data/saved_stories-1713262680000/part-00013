The most annoying ones are spoofed calls \u2014 calls that seem to be\nfrom a trusted number, whether that\u2019s the IRS or someone in your neighborhood.\n(For advice on how to protect yourself and your loved ones from financial\nscams, check out \u201cMarketplace\u2019s\u201d \u201cBrains and Losses\u201d series.)\n\nAs a producer here at Marketplace received her third call with a spoofed\nnumber in one day, we got to wondering: How did it get this way? Our phone\nnumbers feel so personal, and they are almost as important as our Social\nSecurity numbers to identify us when we call our banks or just want to collect\npoints at the supermarket. Why are they so easy to fake?\n\nSearching for an answer took me first into the history of caller ID. It was\nrolled out in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s by phone companies as an add-on to\nyour landline. Back then, phones didn\u2019t have screens, so you\u2019d have to plug in\nan extra box.\n\nCaller ID commercials in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s showed it as a way to\nreduce nuisance calls. In the years since, it\u2019s become a way for spoofers to\nmake them.\n\nThis was pre-internet, pre-email spam, pre-mass financial scam. The engineers\nbuilding the caller ID system didn\u2019t foresee a need to make it secure.\n\nBut in the 1990s, as the internet became more widely available, callers were\nable to make telephone calls through their computers using Voice over Internet\nProtocol technology. This meant anyone, anywhere in the world, could make\nphone calls en masse for very little cost. And they could change the number\nthat call appeared to be coming from. The scourge of spoof-spam calls began.\n\nTo see just how simple it is to spoof a phone number, I tried it. I spent\n$9.95 on 45 calling minutes through an easy-to-find website. It gave me two\nboxes, the destination number and the caller ID to display. I called my co-\nworkers pretending to be our boss. I called friends pretending to be their\nfamily members. And then I ran out of pranks. But the point is, it\u2019s\nridiculously easy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve reached the point where you no longer answer your phone, there is a\nsolution in sight. Part of the deal that phone companies have signed up to is\nto implement a technology called STIR/SHAKEN (or sometimes SHAKEN/STIR). It\u2019s\na contrived acronym for Secure Telephone Identity Revisited and Signature\nBased Handling of Asserted Information using toKENs.\n\n###### Latest Stories on Marketplace\n\n  * Retail sales climbed to a higher-than-expected 0.7% in March\n  * Your last-minute guide to Tax Day\n  * Corporate dealmaking has picked up. That\u2019s good news for bankers \u2014 and the economy.\n\nIt may not block spoofed calls entirely, but it will give us a visual, on-\nscreen, cue that calls really are coming from the number they claim to be,\nwhich may finally make caller ID the useful system it was designed to be.\n\n### Stories You Might Like\n\n#### Why it\u2019s so hard to stop all those spam calls\n\n#### Earnings calls are boring by design\n\n#### Why the Do Not Call list won\u2019t save you from robocalls\n\n#### Why don\u2019t we use 900 numbers anymore?\n\n#### Exploiting our human need for connection\n\n#### As the 988 mental health crisis line goes live, advocates worry it may\nnot be ready\n\nThere\u2019s a lot happening in the world.
