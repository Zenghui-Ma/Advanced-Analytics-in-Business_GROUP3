Trust\nWallet\u2019s alert suggested that the exploit corridor has been on the tech\ngiant\u2019s device since day one.\n\nHowever, the startup did not specify who provided the information or if users\nhad incurred any crypto losses.\n\nTrust Wallet recommended turning off iMessage completely from Apple settings\nto mitigate the issue pending a code fix. At press time, the Silicon Valley\nheavyweight had neither addressed nor denied the claims.\n\n> 2/2: \ud83d\udea8 Recommended action to guard against this iMessage exploit; disable\n> iMessages ASAP until Apple patches this.\n>\n> Navigate to Settings -> Messages -> toggle iMessage off. Maintain this\n> precaution until Apple issues a security patch. Your security is our\n> priority.\n>\n> Stay #SAFU...\n>\n> \u2014 Trust Wallet (@TrustWallet) April 15, 2024\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a branch of the\nUnited States Department of Commerce, previously reported investigations into\nthe Binance-owned application, citing a security flaw noticed in its iOS\nversion.\n\nYou might also like: Trust Wallet discloses Jan. 17 third-party breach\n\n## Apple caught in crypto crosshair\n\nTrust Wallet is the second crypto wallet solution to warn users about this\nmonth\u2019s Apple-related issue. As crypto.news previously reported, Bitcoin (BTC)\nwallet UniSat notified users of a fake version of its decentralized storage\nsolution on the iOS app store.\n\nLast month, the crypto community was aware of a side-channel attack vector,\nGoFetch. This vulnerability allowed bad actors to steal cryptographic keys due\nto a CPU cache bug in Apple\u2019s M1, M2, and M3 MacBook computer chips.\n\nThe company acknowledged the issue, but details on a security patch have yet\nto surface. As a precaution, industry voices like Errata Security CEO Robert\nGraham advised users with substantial crypto holdings to move assets off iOS\ndevices.\n\nRead more: Apple draws crypto criticism again: what you need to know\n\nFollow Us on Google News\n\nRead more about\n\nApple Trust Wallet Vulnerabilities\n\nTrust Wallet\n\n$1.02\n\n24h Volume$26,946,210\n\nMarket Cap$422,001,873\n\n24h Low/High$0.97 / $1.14\n\n24h-6.04%\n\n7d-21.6%\n\n### Top Stories\n\nTop Stories\n\n### CoinShares: Investors withdraw $126m as crypto confidence wanes\n\n7 hours ago\n\nTop Stories\n\n### Trust Wallet warns Apple iOS users of iMessage vulnerability\n\n28 seconds ago\n\nTop Stories\n\n### Defi platform on Base network experiences $2m hack\n\n7 hours ago\n\nTop Stories\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\u2019s 100 ETH Railgun deposit sparks discourse\n\n5 hours ago\n\nTop Stories\n\n### Bitcoin dominance back at 2021 high, boosted by ETFs\n\n5 hours ago\n\n### Related News\n\nNews\n\nRead more - Bitcoin wallet UniSat warns of fake Apple iOS app\n\nBitcoin wallet UniSat warns of fake Apple iOS app\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nFeatures\n\nRead more - Apple draws crypto criticism again: what you need to know\n\nApple draws crypto criticism again: what you need to know\n\nMarch 27, 2024 at 1:55 pm\n\nNews\n\nRead more - Trust Wallet discloses Jan. 17 third-party breach\n\nTrust Wallet discloses Jan. 17 third-party breach\n\nJanuary 29, 2024 at 9:36 pm\n\nWith over $2.2 Million Raised is this the Next Bonk or Pepe?\n\nNugget Rush\n\nSign up for daily crypto news in your inbox\n\nGet crypto analysis, news and updates right to your inbox!
