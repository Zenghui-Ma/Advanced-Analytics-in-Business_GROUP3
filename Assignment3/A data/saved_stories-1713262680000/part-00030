The attack\nincluded about 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles. But\nsomething pretty incredible happened \u2014 almost all of the drones and missiles\nwere shot down before they could hit Israel, by a combination of Israeli,\nU.S., Jordanian, French, British, and possibly Saudi forces. Only a few\nballistic missiles made it through, wounding one Arab Israeli girl severely\nand causing minor injuries to a few other people.\n\nMy thoughts on the geopolitics of this attack are going to be pretty familiar\n\u2014 the Middle East conflict is a distraction from far more important matters in\nEast Asia, and we should keep our role to a minimum. The Gaza war has not\nfundamentally altered the balance of power in the Middle East; Israel and the\nSunni powers are unofficial and uneasy partners against Iran and its proxies.\nBoth sides are pretty brutal, and neither looks likely to dominate the other.\nU.S. resources and attention are far better spent elsewhere.\n\nWith that out of the way, I think the really interesting part of this story is\nthat almost everything the Iranians threw at Israel was intercepted. Drones\nare slow-moving and easy to shoot down, but ballistic missiles are fast-moving\nand generally very hard to hit. Yet Israel\u2019s Arrow system, jointly developed\nwith the U.S., had little trouble knocking most of Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles\nout of the sky \u2014 with some interceptions even occurring outside of Earth\u2019s\natmosphere.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty interesting, because for most of my adult life, I believed that\nballistic missile defense was a hopeless, failed cause. From the 2000s all the\nway through the 2010s, I read lots of op-eds about how kinetic interceptors \u2014\n\u201chitting a bullet with a bullet\u201d were just an unworkably difficult technology,\nand how the U.S. shouldn\u2019t waste our time and money on developing this sort of\nsystem. For example, all the way back in 2006, Matt Yglesias \u2014 among my\nfavorite bloggers, both then and now \u2014 wrote the following:\n\n> This is madness. We're spending billions of dollars to defend ourselves\n> against ballistic missiles that don't exist. What's more, the defense system\n> doesn't work and never has. At best, it occasionally kinda sorta passes\n> rigged tests. I'm a \"never say never\" kind of guy, but the odds of it ever\n> working seem bad. The technical challenges are daunting: Building a missile\n> that can reliably hit another missile is simply very difficult. Missiles are\n> small, move very quickly, and are difficult to launch within the time frame\n> necessary to intercept one that's already in the air. What's more, unlike,\n> say, computers or telecommunications, the general field of aerospace\n> engineering hasn't seen any significant advances in decades...\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to be too unfair to Matt here. Even the most ardent\nsupporters of missile defense don\u2019t think it could stop a nuclear strike by\nRussia or China. Briefly, ballistic missiles are grouped into four categories,\naccording to their range \u2014 short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental\n(ICBM). The longer-range a missile is, the faster it moves when it reenters\nthe atmosphere, and thus the harder it is to hit. Our best existing anti-\nmissile systems \u2014 Israel\u2019s Arrow and the U.S.\u2019 THAAD \u2014 can only handle\nintermediate-range ballistic missiles at best. ICBMs, of the type that Russia\nor China would launch against us in a full-scale nuclear war, are too fast for\nus to hit with current technology. Nuclear missiles also use other\ntechnologies that make them harder to stop, like multiple warheads (MIRV), and\na nuclear attack might be accompanied by a large number of decoy missiles.\n\nIn short, Matt and the many other critics of missile defense were right that\nmissile defense will probably not provide us with an invincible anti-nuclear\numbrella anytime soon. But they were wrong about much else (as Matt has since\nacknowledged). The purpose of this post isn\u2019t to dunk on Matt or any of the\nother critics \u2014 after all, I also believed missile defense didn\u2019t work. But\nthe way in which critics got this issue wrong illustrates why it\u2019s difficult\nto get good information about military technology \u2014 and therefore why it\u2019s\nhard for the public to make smart, well-informed choices about defense\nspending.\n\nOne big reason critics got missile defense wrong was that they didn\u2019t\nunderstand the technological advances that were making it possible to \u201chit a\nbullet with a bullet\u201d. No, the basics of rocketry and aerodynamics haven\u2019t\nchanged much in recent years. But the key to hitting a bullet with a bullet\nisn\u2019t building a faster or more maneuverable rocket \u2014 it\u2019s figuring out where\nthe target is going to be. Advances in detection technology \u2014 better sensors,\nand especially better software to process the signals from sensors \u2014 have made\nit a lot easier to observe a missile\u2019s trajectory to a high degree of\nprecision. Therefore it has become more feasible to predict exactly where it\u2019s\ngoing to go, so you can get an interceptor there first.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t critics realize the central importance of detection software, and\nhow fast it was improving? Well, because they\u2019re not experts in the field.\nThis isn\u2019t a knock against them, or a demand that they \u201cstay in their lane\u201d \u2014\nif you\u2019re a writer who writes about politics and policy and budget priorities,\nyou pretty much have to have an opinion on defense spending, because it\u2019s a\nbig and important part of the budget. No writer can be an expert on everything\n(except Brian Potter, but he\u2019s one of a kind). So instead, as a writer, you go\nlooking for domain experts to explain things to you, or at least point you to\nsome good reading material so you can teach yourself the basics.\n\nMissile defense critics were badly served by their go-to experts. The loudest\nand most prominent of these was Theodore Postol, a professor at MIT. He was a\nrelentless lifelong critic of missile defense, penning numerous op-eds on the\ntopic over the years. And his work was recognized by other scientists \u2014 he won\nawards from the American Physical Society in 1990, the American Association\nfor the Advancement of Science in 1995, the Federation of American Scientists\nin 2016, and others, all for his criticisms of missile defense. After the Gulf\nWar in the early 90s, Postol went around claiming that the Patriot missile had\nperformed much more poorly than believed, and had shot down almost no incoming\nmissiles at all.\n\nAnd Postol had plenty of scientific arguments on his side. For example, in MIT\nTechnology Review in 2002, he briefly explained some of the physics of why\nincoming missiles are hard to spot:\n\n> For one thing, measuring temperature with this infrared equipment is not\n> possible when objects in space are observed close to the earth, because\n> their signals are routinely contaminated by reflected infrared radiation\n> from the planet\u2019s surface; they are further confused by such factors as the\n> amount of cloud cover, time of year and which part of the earth the target\n> is over.\n\nThis isn\u2019t wrong; Postol isn\u2019t an ignoramus. But it seems that he didn\u2019t\nreckon with just how amazingly good software (and hardware detection\ntechnology) would get. By the time the Ukraine War came around, the Patriot\nmissiles that Postol had spent so many years assailing had become star\nperformers, shooting down Russian Iskander ballistic missiles and hypersonic\nKinzhal missiles. Now, Israel\u2019s even more-advanced Arrow system is shooting\ndown even longer-ranged, faster ballistic missiles (which, by the way, have\nthe same range as China\u2019s DF-21 anti-ship missile). Postol also claimed in\n2014 that Israel\u2019s shorter-range Iron Dome system didn\u2019t work, which turned\nout to be very wrong.\n\nPostol is a smart guy, and there\u2019s no reason to think he\u2019s a liar or beholden\nto foreign interests. He\u2019s just an expert with strong opinions who happened to\nbe wrong about a lot of stuff. But because he was so loud and strident and\nactivist, journalists looking for an expert on missile defense would often\nfind him and quote him. And op-ed writers looking for background knowledge on\nmissile defense would read his writings and take them to heart. So his\nmistakes got amplified and became conventional wisdom.\n\nWhat about other experts? Why didn\u2019t people who understood the advances in\nsensing and detection software push back and explain to journalists and op-ed\nwriters why missile defense was a better idea than Postol was saying? Well,\nI\u2019m not sure, but one likely reason is that many of these experts worked for\ndefense contractors or for the national defense establishment. So most of them\nwere probably obligated not to blab to the press about missile defense\u2019s true\ncapabilities. Unlike Russia, which tends to overhype its weapons in order to\nboost arms exports, the U.S. tries very hard to hide its weapons\u2019 true\ncapabilities \u2014 for example, the Patriot wasn\u2019t officially supposed to be able\nto shoot down the Kinzhal, but it did.\n\nSo we have an asymmetry here. The information about how good America\u2019s weapons\nsystems are gets kept behind closed doors, unveiled in secret Congressional\nbriefings and whispered between defense contractors. Meanwhile, everyone who\nwants to criticize U.S. weapons systems is on the outside, squawking loudly to\nthe press.\n\nIn fact, an even more egregious example concerns warplanes. For many years, I\nbelieved \u2014 and even repeated \u2014 the conventional wisdom that the F-35 was an\nexpensive boondoggle with dubious military value. I also saw a number of\npeople claim that the A-10 \u201cWarthog\u201d, a low-flying plane with a big gun for\nstrafing tanks, was a great plane, and that we should be building more of that\ninstead of the fancy, overengineered F-35.\n\nIt turns out that many of these criticisms came from a man named Pierre Sprey,\nwho claimed to have worked for the DoD on the development of a number of\nplanes. Although more astute aerospace experts knew that many of his\ncriticisms of the F-35 were uninformed and false, journalists and op-ed\nwriters frequently cited his claims that the plane basically didn\u2019t work.\n\nWell, it turns out that Sprey wasn\u2019t really much of an expert. Internet\nsleuths discovered that his involvement with the development of planes like\nthe A-10 and F-16 was very minor at best, and he was quietly removed from some\nof the relevant Wikipedia pages.\n\nMeanwhile, the F-35, despite going way over its initial budget and having some\ninitial performance issues, is now apparently performing extremely well. A\nbunch of countries are ordering large numbers of F-35s \u2014 so many that Lockheed\nMartin is having trouble manufacturing enough of them to meet the demand.\n\nSo the program that we pundits held up as a paradigmatic example of defense\ncontractor waste and ineffectiveness turns out to have been...pretty good\nafter all! Why? In an entertainingly silly but well-argued YouTube video,\nBritish defense commentator LazerPig argues that most of the F-35\u2019s good\npoints were simply kept behind closed doors:\n\nAs with missile defense, we see the same basic story. A difficult technology\nis developed by the Pentagon at great expense, behind closed doors, over\ndecades. At first there are big technical hurdles and some initial failures,\nand some of those problems leak out to the press, which rushes to jump on an\nexample of the waste and fecklessness of the military-industrial complex.\nMeanwhile, the technology\u2019s successes and true capabilities are hushed up and\nkept behind closed doors, in order to avoid alerting America\u2019s rivals to our\ntrue strength.\n\nMeanwhile, a small handful of loud, highly opinionated experts (or, sometimes,\n\u201cexperts\u201d) outside the defense establishment shout to anyone and everyone that\nthe technology doesn\u2019t work, can\u2019t work, and will never work. This reinforces\nthe basic narrative, and the critics seem to have good technical reasons and\ncredentials, so the pundits declare that the program is yet another boondoggle\nby America\u2019s failing and overpaid military establishment. Conclusion: We\nshould cut defense spending and divert the money to social programs.\n\nThat conclusion is, of course, likely to be influenced by domestic battles\nover income distribution. Back in the post-WW2 period, defense spending was a\nbipartisan thing, but since Reagan\u2019s military buildup in the 1980s, it has\nbecome Republican-coded. I remember seeing this slogan ad infinitum in my\nyouth:\n\nThis quote is attributed to Robert Fulghum, author of All I Really Need to\nKnow I Learned in Kindergarten. I suppose kindergartners don\u2019t learn that U.S.\ndefense spending has fallen as a share of GDP for decades on end, or that\npublic education spending is now considerably higher as a share of GDP.\n\nBut in any case, the notion that defense spending needs to be cut, and the\nmoney diverted to social programs, has become conventional wisdom in\nprogressive circles. This conventional wisdom seems unrelated to how much we\nactually spend on defense, or what our national security threats are. It\u2019s\nsimply a fixed belief. And that fixed belief makes it a lot easier to believe\nthat specific items of defense spending \u2014 missile defense, or the F-35, etc. \u2014\nare expensive boondoggles that can and should be cut.\n\nA natural tendency toward short-sightedness about the security environment\npresents a final obstacle to clear-headed writing about defense spending. In\nthe mid-2000s, it seemed clear to many people that our main military challenge\nwas counterinsurgency \u2014 after all, that\u2019s what we were doing in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. In his 2006 article, Yglesias argued that the only reason we\u2019d\nwant missile defense is if we wanted to attack other countries:\n\n> The only situation in which a missile shield, if it worked, would possibly\n> be useful is if we wanted to invade another country and stop it from\n> deterring us with its missiles. This, however, is a pretty terrible\n> idea...Ballistic missile defense is, in short, not just a waste of money,\n> but the tip of a wildly misguided intellectual iceberg \u2014 a whole worldview\n> that radically misconceives the nature of America's interests and the\n> contemporary international situation. The conservative movement is committed\n> to an outlook that revolves around impractical solutions to unreal problems,\n> and missile defense is just one more example to add to a pile including the\n> invasion of Iraq, the decision to spurn Iranian peace overtures, and the\n> effort to define the (necessary) struggle against al Qaeda in the broadest\n> and most apocalyptic terms available.\n\nFast forward two decades, and this outlook looks dangerously naive. Russia\u2019s\ninvasion of Ukraine, Iran\u2019s attacks on Israel, and a possible Chinese attack\non Taiwan or the Philippines show the importance of ballistic missile defense\nas a way of blocking attacks by invading states. In 2006, in the middle of the\nWar on Terror, it might have seemed inconceivable that just 18 years later,\nthe world would see multiple authoritarian empires waging aggressive,\nexpansionist wars, and that the U.S. and its allies would be playing a\nbeleaguered defense. But here we are.\n\nIf we could pivot our military procurement and research on a dime, this\nwouldn\u2019t be a problem; we could just direct all our spending and effort to\nsolving the problems of the day, instead of trying to think decades ahead. But\nmodern military technologies like missile defense or the F-35 are so complex,\nexpensive, and difficult that they take decades to develop. The U.S.\u2019 anti\nballistic missile program has been in development since the 1950s, and the\ndevelopment of the Arrow program that shot down those Iranian ballistic\nmissiles began in 1986.\n\nWe can\u2019t know what kinds of threats we\u2019ll be facing in four decades. But we\nhave a basic idea about the types of threats that might emerge, and \u201chostile\npower armed with ballistic missiles\u201d was as plausible of a future threat in\n2006 as it was in 1986. Fortune favors the prepared.\n\nThis is hardly an exhaustive list of the reasons writing about defense\nspending is challenging. Defense contractors, the Defense Department, and the\nmilitary themselves all have their points of view and their interests to\nprotect. Conservatives are just as likely to play politics with this issue as\nprogressives. Foreign interests are at work here too \u2014 countries like Russia\nand Iran constantly push the narrative that they\u2019re peaceful and that U.S.\nmilitarism is the main force pushing war upon the world. And there\u2019s a whole\ngeneration of Americans \u2014 my generation \u2014 who watched the Iraq War unfold\nduring our formative years, and who are thus biased toward thinking of wars as\nsomething that America chooses instead of something that is forced upon us.\n\nThere\u2019s no easy solution here, other than simply being aware of these\ndifficulties and trying very hard to counteract them. We pundits should talk\nto and listen to a variety of experts, not just the loudest and most\nconfident. While recognizing that we don\u2019t have enough time to become experts\nin everything, we should still try to understand the underlying technologies\nas best we can, as well as the details of the defense procurement process. And\nmost importantly, in my opinion, we should keep the interests of the nation\nforemost in our mind, and remember that if the U.S. goes down, whether\nDemocrats or Republicans are in power will hardly matter.\n\nShare\n\n206 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n16 Restacks\n\n206\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why so many of us were wrong about missile defense\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n57\n\nShare\n\n57 Comments\n\nLarry SchweikartLarry's Commentary5 hrs agoLiked by Noah SmithRonald Reagan\nwas absolutely right about \"Star Wars.\" 1) He said the actual tech wouldn't be\nready for 20 years (in fact, it was ready much earlier); 2) Early systems,\nwhile not exceptionally effective in 1991, were effective enough; 3) The\nmedia, calling it \"star wars\" did Reagan a huge favor by making the\ntechnologically difficult understandable; 4) Gorby knew it would work.
