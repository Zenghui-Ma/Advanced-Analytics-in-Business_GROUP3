The variant identified in the fibronectin gene seems to protect\nagainst Alzheimer\u2019s disease by preventing the buildup of excess fibronectin at\nthe blood-brain barrier.\n\n\"It\u2019s a classic case of too much of a good thing,\u201d Kizil says. \u201cIt made us\nthink that excess fibronectin could be preventing the clearance of amyloid\ndeposits from the brain.\u201d\n\nThe researchers confirmed that hypothesis in a zebrafish model of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease and have additional studies in mice underway. They also found that\nreducing fibronectin in the animals increased amyloid clearance and improved\nother damage caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cThese results gave us the idea that a therapy targeting fibronectin and\nmimicking the protective variant could provide a strong defense against the\ndisease in people,\u201d says study co-leader Richard Mayeux, MD, chair of\nneurology and the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Professor of Neurology, Psychiatry,\nand Epidemiology.\n\nThe newest treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease target the amyloid deposits\ndirectly and are very efficient at removing the deposits via the immune\nsystem. However, simply removing the deposits this way doesn\u2019t improve\nsymptoms or repair other damage.\n\n\u201cWe may need to start clearing amyloid much earlier and we think that can be\ndone through the bloodstream,\u201d Mayeux adds. \u201cThat's why we are excited about\nthe discovery of this variant in fibronectin, which may be a good target for\ndrug development.\u201d\n\n## Protective gene was found in people resilient to Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nThe researchers discovered the protective variant in people who never\ndeveloped symptoms but who had inherited the e4 form of the APOE gene, which\nsignificantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cThese resilient people can tell us a lot about the disease and what genetic\nand non-genetic factors might provide protection,\u201d says study co-leader Badri\nN. Vardarajan, PhD, assistant professor of neurological science (in neurology,\nthe Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center, and the Taub Institute), who is an expert\nin using computational approaches to discover Alzheimer\u2019s disease genes.\n\n\"We hypothesized that these resilient people may have genetic variants that\nprotect them from APOEe4.\u201d\n\nTo find protective mutations, the Columbia researchers sequenced the genomes\nof several hundred APOEe4 carriers over age 70 of various ethnic backgrounds,\nincluding those with and without Alzheimer's disease. Many participants were\nresidents of Northern Manhattan who were enrolled in the Washington\nHeights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project, an ongoing study that has been\nconducted by Columbia University\u2019s Department of Neurology for more than 30\nyears.\n\nThe study identified the fibronectin variant, and the Columbia team publicized\ntheir results in a preprint for other researchers to view. Based on the\nColumbia team\u2019s observations, another group from Stanford and Washington\nuniversities replicated the study in an independent cohort of APOEe4 carriers,\nmostly of European origin.\n\n\u201cThey found the same fibronectin variant, which confirmed our finding and gave\nus even more confidence in our result,\u201d Vardarajan says.\n\nThe two groups combined the data on their 11,000 participants, which allowed\nthem to calculate that the mutation reduces the odds of developing Alzheimer\u2019s\nin APOE4 carriers by 71% and forestalls the disease by roughly four years in\nthose who eventually develop the disease.\n\nThe researchers estimate that 1% to 3% of APOEe4 carriers in the United\nStates\u2014roughly 200,000 to 620,000 people\u2014may also carry the protective\nfibronectin mutation.\n\n## Wide therapeutic potential\n\nThe fibronectin variant, though discovered in APOEe4 carriers, could protect\nagainst Alzheimer\u2019s disease in people with other forms of APOE.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant difference in fibronectin levels in the blood-brain\nbarrier between cognitively healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's\ndisease, independent of their APOEe4 status,\u201d Kizil says.\n\n\u201cAnything that reduces excess fibronectin should provide some protection, and\na drug that does this could be a significant step forward in the fight against\nthis debilitating condition.\u201d\n\n## Topics\n\nNeurology, Alzheimer's, Research\n\n## References\n\n## More information\n\nThe study, \u201cRare genetic variation in Fibronectin 1 (FN1) protects against\nAPOE\u03b54 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease(link is external and opens in a new window),\u201d\nwas published online April 10 in the journal Acta Neuropathologica.\n\nThe research and researchers were supported by the Carol and Gene Ludwig\nFamily Foundation, the Agouron Institute, the U.S. National Institutes of\nHealth (grants R01AG067501, RF1AG066107, R01AG072474, R35GM148348,\nR01AG061796, U19AG074879, U01AG066752, U01AG046139, R01AG060747, P50AG047366,\nand R00AG075238), a Schaefer Research Scholars Award, Taub Institute Grant for\nEmerging Research (TIGER), the Thompson Family Foundation Program for\nAccelerated Medicine Exploration in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders\nof the Nervous System, and an Alzheimer\u2019s Association Zenith Fellows Award.\n\nRichard Mayeux, MD, is also director of the Gertrude H.
