The time and cost of\ngetting the samples back to Earth has become a sticking point.\n\n(NASA / JPL-Caltech / MSSS)\n\nBy Corinne PurtillStaff Writer\n\nApril 15, 2024 12:54 PM PT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * Print\n\nAfter months of turmoil over the future of a vaunted mission to bring samples\nof the Red Planet back to Earth, NASA has its verdict on Mars Sample Return.\n\nThe space agency is \u201ccommitted\u201d to bringing those rocks back from Mars,\nAdministrator Bill Nelson said Monday, but it will have to do it with way less\nmoney and in far less time than currently designed.\n\nAnd how exactly is NASA going to pull that off? Right now it has no idea \u2014 and\nit\u2019s looking for someone who does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have asked our folks to reach out with a request for information to\nindustry, to [the Jet Propulsion Laboratory] and to all NASA centers, and to\nreport back this fall an alternate plan that will get [the samples] back\nquicker and cheaper,\u201d Nelson said in a news conference at NASA headquarters.\n\nHis comments came in response to an independent review commissioned by NASA\nlast year that declared there was \u201cnear zero probability\u201d of Mars Sample\nReturn making its proposed 2028 launch date, and \u201cno credible\u201d way to fulfill\nthe mission within its current budget.\n\nPulling off the mission as designed would probably cost up to $11 billion, the\nreview board found, with the samples not reaching Earth until at least 2040.\n\nScience & Medicine\n\n### NASA\u2019s attempt to bring home part of Mars is unprecedented. The mission\u2019s\nproblems are not\n\nCould JPL\u2019s ambitious Mars Sample Return mission use the long-troubled,\nmassively over budget, but ultimately successful James Webb Space Telescope as\na guide?\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that $11 billion is too expensive, and not returning\nsamples until 2040 is unacceptably too long,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the decade of\nthe 2040s that we\u2019re going to be landing astronauts on Mars.\u201d\n\nNASA will direct $310 million to Mars Sample Return this year, less than half\nof the amount it\u2019s allowed to spend on the project and a fraction of last\nyear\u2019s $822.3-million budget.\n\nNext year, the agency will request just $200 million from Congress for the\nmission \u2014 a head-spinning drop from the $949 million the Biden administration\nwanted to invest in Mars Sample Return in March 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement comes as something of a blow to JPL, the La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\ninstitution tasked with managing the mission. JPL has already laid off more\nthan 600 employees and 40 contractors this year after NASA ordered it to\nreduce spending in anticipation of budget cuts spurred by the challenges of\nMars Sample Return.\n\nProposals go out soon to all NASA centers and the private aerospace sector for\n\u201ca revised plan that utilizes innovation and proven technology to lower risks,\nto lower costs and to lower mission complexity so we can return these really\nprecious samples to Earth in the 2030s,\u201d said Nicky Fox, associate\nadministrator of the Science Mission Directorate. The due date for proposals\nis next month, and those selected for further study will get NASA grants this\nsummer.\n\nThis essentially puts JPL in a position of having to compete for its own\nproject.\n\n\u201cRight now if JPL were to come up with the answer, then I\u2019d say JPL is gonna\nbe sitting pretty good,\u201d Nelson said during Monday\u2019s news conference. \u201cBut\nwe\u2019re opening this up to everyone because we want to get every new and fresh\nidea that we can.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s decision to outsource a solution to the Mars Sample Return problem\nfrustrated some Mars scientists.\n\n\u201cWhat I expected is for NASA to step up and say, \u2018These things are hard and we\nchoose to do them,\u2019 \u201d said Bethany L. Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at\nCaltech. \u201cThat is the leadership required to be the nation leading the world\nin space exploration.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of California\u2019s congressional delegation expressed dismay.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that after eight long months of review on the Mars Sample\nReturn mission, NASA is only just now issuing a call for studies on the best\npath forward,\u201d Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawmakers have lobbied to preserve JPL\u2019s funding, citing the need to protect\njobs and keep the U.S. space program competitive. China has announced a sample\nreturn mission of its own to launch in 2028 or 2030.\n\n\u201cThese cuts will delay the mission at a critical time, further diminish our\nhighly skilled workforce, and significantly undermine California\u2019s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory and our state\u2019s globally leading science and space\nleadership as we face increasing competition with China,\u201d California\u2019s U.S.\nsenators, Alex Padilla and Laphonza Butler, said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge Administrator Nelson to work with Congress to better balance\nthese cuts so that the JPL workforce is protected and the mission proceeds.\u201d\n\nScience & Medicine\n\n### NASA finally figures out how to open a $1-billion canister\n\nLate last year, a spacecraft containing samples of a 4.6-billion-year-old\nasteroid landed safely in the desert after a 1.2-billion mile journey.\n\nJan. 21, 2024\n\nA joint project with the European Space Agency, Mars Sample Return would\ndeliver rocks, rubble and dust that have already been gathered and sealed into\ntubes by the Perseverance rover.\n\nThe current design relies on a lander that would retrieve those tubes from the\nRed Planet\u2019s Jezero Crater and use a small rocket to ferry them into Martian\norbit, where they would rendezvous with a spacecraft that would make the\njourney back to Earth. That craft would touch down on Earth roughly five years\nafter the orbiter\u2019s launch.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to comb the samples for evidence that life has ever\nexisted on Mars, and to help NASA plan for future crewed missions, Nelson\nsaid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the most recent planetary science decadal survey \u2014 a report prepared for\nNASA every 10 years by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and\nMedicine \u2014 planetary scientists named the Mars Sample Return mission as the\n\u201chighest scientific priority of NASA\u2019s robotic exploration efforts this\ndecade\u201d and argued that the program should be completed \u201cas soon as is\npracticably possible with no increase or decrease in its current scope.\u201d\n\nBut the authors cautioned that the ambitious mission shouldn\u2019t come at the\ncost of other planetary science, suggesting a roughly $5-billion to $7-billion\ncap.\n\n\u201cMars Sample Return is of fundamental strategic importance to NASA, U.S.\nleadership in planetary science, and international cooperation and should be\ncompleted as rapidly as possible,\u201d the report stated. \u201cHowever, its cost\nshould not be allowed to undermine the long-term programmatic balance of the\nplanetary portfolio.\u201d\n\nThe agency is committing to keeping the mission within that recommended\nbudget, Nelson said. Allowing Mars Sample Return\u2019s costs to reach the $8\nbillion to $11 billion the review board estimated would require NASA \u201cto\ncannibalize other programs, other science programs, and there are so many that\nare absolutely important,\u201d Nelson said.\n\n\u201cJPL remains strongly committed to the Mars Sample Return mission, the highest\npriority in the past two planetary science decadal surveys,\u201d the institution\nsaid in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to contribute our unique capabilities\nto NASA and all partners to ensure mission success.\u201d\n\nScience & Medicine\n\n### Budget deal for NASA offers glimmer of hope for JPL\u2019s Mars Sample Return\nmission\n\nWith a final 2024 budget for NASA in place, the space agency has directed JPL\nnot to cut any more staff working on the Mars Sample Return mission.\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Letters to the Editor: \u2018Beat China\u2019 is a bad justification for Mars exploration\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\n  * ### Opinion: Mars rocks are a science prize the U.S. can\u2019t afford to lose\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n  * ### Sideways moon landing cuts mission short, private U.S. lunar lander will stop working\n\nFeb. 26, 2024\n\nScience & MedicineCalifornia\n\nCorinne Purtill\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n\nCorinne Purtill is a science and medicine reporter for the Los Angeles Times.\nHer writing on science and human behavior has appeared in the New Yorker, the\nNew York Times, Time Magazine, the BBC, Quartz and elsewhere.
