Were the Anglo-Saxon kings recycling old Roman scrap metal? Or had they\nfound lucrative sources from mines in Europe?\n\nMetallurgical analysis of early medieval coins has revealed the answer: the\npower brokers of the time were melting down their stockpiles of Byzantine\nsilver treasures, in a type of early medieval quantitative easing that\nkickstarted the economy of England and established a monetary system that\nwould last for a millennium.\n\nChemical analysis of coins from the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has\nrevealed two distinct phases of the silver rush. For almost a century from the\n660s, coins were minted from silver bullion that originated in the Byzantine\nempire on the eastern Mediterranean. Then, after stocks of those treasures\nwere drying up in about 750, silver from a mine in western France came to\npredominate across Europe, during the reign of Charlemagne.\n\nA selection of the Fitzwilliam Museum coins that were studied. Photograph: The\nFitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge\n\n\u201cThis was such an exciting discovery,\u201d said Rory Naismith, a professor of\nearly medieval English history at the University of Cambridge, one of the\nacademics behind the study. \u201cNow we have the first archaeometric confirmation\nthat Byzantine silver was the dominant source behind the great seventh-century\nsurge in minting and trade around the North Sea.\u201d\n\nThe coins that were minted were silver pennies \u2013 each perhaps equivalent to\n\u00a320-\u00a330 today \u2013 which formed \u201cthe bedrock of the English economy\u201d until at\nleast the 16th century, Naismith said.\n\nIntriguingly, the isotopic signature of the Byzantine silver showed it was\nalready decades or more old \u2013 most likely it had been prized as a way to\ndisplay its owner\u2019s power and wealth. The ruler honoured at Sutton Hoo,\nthought to be Raedwald of East Anglia, was buried with a collection of\nByzantine silver bowls and other items which, if melted down, could have made\n10,000 pennies, the authors say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say we were surprised by this result,\u201d said Dr Jane Kershaw, an\nassociate professor at Oxford University\u2019s school of archaeology and the\nstudy\u2019s lead author. \u201cWe know of some surviving Byzantine silver from Anglo-\nSaxon England, most famously from Sutton Hoo, but far greater amounts of\nByzantine silver must have originally been held in Anglo-Saxon stores.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis was quantitative easing \u2013 elites were liquidating silver\nstored in valuable objects and using that silver to make coins that then\ncirculated widely. It would have had a big impact on people\u2019s lives. Far more\npeople than before would have used coined money and thought in terms of\nmonetary values.\u201d\n\nNot only rulers but also powerful monasteries minted their own coins, said\nNaismith. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a Bank of England at this stage \u2013 if you want some\ncoins, you make some coins. You just need to be someone who\u2019s got the wealth\nto do it.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Edition\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s\nhappening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

It shows that if people in\nEngland wanted to have a complex economy with currency, they couldn\u2019t just\nrely on the resources at home \u2013 they needed to deal with people in the\nMediterranean, in France, in all sorts of other places.\n\n\u201cIt shows interdependency, and how connections and networks have been\nfundamental to economic success for hundreds and hundreds of years.\u201d\n\nThe research is published in Antiquity.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Archaeology\n  * England\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \u2018Very rare\u2019 clay figurine of Mercury discovered at Roman site in Kent\n\n23 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Forging new history\u2019: high-end iron age smithy unearthed in Oxfordshire\n\n28 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Early medieval Welsh cemetery found containing crouching bodies\n\n3 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Cerne Abbas giant is Hercules and was army meeting point, say historians\n\n1 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### National Trust archaeologists find medieval \u2018gift token\u2019 in Norfolk\n\n18 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Archaeologists reveal life stories of hundreds of people from medieval Cambridge\n\n1 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Coin hoard that could be linked to Glen Coe massacre found under fireplace\n\n9 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Stone age Dartmoor viewpoint uncovered by archaeologists\n\n30 Aug 2023\n\n  * ### \u2018Hugely exciting and rare\u2019: Neolithic polishing stone found in Dorset\n\n14 Jul 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
