Dedicated followers\nand irate haters dominate the extremes. In the middle lie profiles like Hazme\nuna foto as\u00ed (Take a photo of me like this), an Instagram account born during\nthe pandemic with the aim of parodying the most-followed influencers in Spain.\nWhat started as entertainment has today turned into an account with nearly\n300,000 followers. The paradox is that now Lorena Mac\u00edas, its founder, is also\na content creator.\n\nHowever, her posts do not share tricks to make money by investing in\ncryptocurrencies, nor do they reveal the umpteenth garment purchased at Zara.\nHer posts echo the blunders made by influencers (almost always alluding to\nfemale figures) and the brazenness and lack of ethics many accounts display\nwhen advertising products. \u201cI started uploading memes to pass the time and\nsuddenly they started to go viral. At the beginning it was spontaneous and\nunpretentious, but naturally, having always worked in advertising, when I saw\nthat the account was gathering a good group of people, I tried to pull the\nright levers to make it grow\u201d, says Mac\u00edas, an advertising creative by\nprofession.\n\n### Humor as a tool for criticism\n\nHumorously, but without taking it entirely as a joke, Mac\u00edas highlights the\nlack of scruples on the part of those who take advantage of almost nonexistent\nlegislation on content creation to profit by recommending articles without\nissuing a warning that it is advertising. Or those who resell a product on\nsecond-hand platforms moments after having told their audience how much they\nlike it. The account\u2019s followers are, in many cases, regular users of social\nnetworks and knowledgeable about the influencers that inhabit them; others are\nalien to this microcosm of unbridled consumerism. All of them, though, connect\nwith the narrative of Hazme una foto as\u00ed, and its balance between humor,\ncriticism and reflection. \u201cI think people connect because they\u2019re fed up with\nposturing, with Instagram\u2019s impostor perfection and, above all, with being\nlied to. And also because I try to do it through humor, which is a universal\nand very powerful resource that doesn\u2019t need great context. In fact, the\nmessage I get the most is: \u2018I don\u2019t know any of the influencers you\u2019re talking\nabout, but I\u2019m pissing myself laughing at how you present it,\u2019\u201d Mac\u00edas tells\nEL PA\u00cdS.\n\nGlobally, the forerunner that inspired many of these parody accounts is\nInfluencers in the Wild, one of the first profiles to point out the absurdity\nthat sometimes surrounds social media. Created by George Resch (known on the\ninternet as Tank Sinatra) to lift the lid on the lengths to which some content\ncreators go to get the dream photo, it brings together more than five million\nloyal followers. By decontextualizing the publications and revealing the\nreality behind the apparent perfection and spontaneity that many influencers\nseek to sell, it becomes clear that naturalness is conspicuous by its absence.\n\nHow are these criticisms and parodies received from the other side of the\ncoin? In the opinion of Sergio Barreda, CEO of the influencer agency Keepers,\n\u201cthe beauty of the networks is the plurality they offer and, therefore, there\nhas to be room for these types of profiles that base their content more on\nsatire or irony, which has always been present in humor; but, as in comedy,\nthe key is always to do it from a humorous point of view and not by resorting\nto easy criticism.\u201d\n\nHumor is also the hallmark of Models with Sciatica, an account created by\nLaura C. \u2014 she prefers not to give her last name \u2014 in July 2020, in which she\nplaces the spotlight on the hyper-sexualization of women in the fashion\nindustry. She says that the profile \u201cgrew in a totally crazy way in less than\n24 hours.\u201d Her feed is made up of images from campaigns or editorials where\nmodels appear in impossible poses. The fun is in the text that accompanies\neach photograph: brief, accurate and sarcastic. The formula is not very new,\nbut it came at the right time. With little expectation, her first post\ngarnered \u201cmore than 500 followers in half an hour. In 24 hours, there were\nmore than 20,000. It was crazy,\u201d says Laura in conversation with this\nnewspaper. Since then, her community has exceeded 32,000 followers.\n\nWhen asked about the potential for controversy as a result of her\npublications, she says that \u201cby not focusing on anyone\u201d in particular, she has\nnot made any enemies, although \u201cthere has been someone who has come in to\nargue for the sake of arguing, and I don\u2019t waste much time there.\u201d Mac\u00edas, who\nhas been blocked on Instagram by some of the content creators she has alluded\nto in her publications, cannot say the same. However, anger is the exception:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same for me to parody a gaffe or a memeable pose as it is for me\nto publicly point out that you are reselling the products that a brand sent\nyou yesterday, because that speaks of your professionalism and your ethics.\nAnd that, naturally, doesn\u2019t sit well with anyone,\u201d says Mac\u00edas, who as a\nresult of the success of the profile has set up her own advertising agency and\na podcast to address issues related to the sector from a more serious\nperspective.\n\n### An industry under construction\n\nIn Barreda\u2019s experience, not all influencers react the same way to criticism.\n\u201cFashion and lifestyle profiles are the ones that are attacked or criticized\nthe most, and, therefore, I think they have the worst time with these types of\nmessages,\u201d he says. \u201cHumor or entertainment profiles take criticism in a\ndifferent way, less personally.\u201d\n\nDespite its growing visibility, the public calling out of Hazme una foto as\u00ed\nhas not had too many consequences. \u201cIn some cases, brands have contacted me\nprivately to inform me that they have terminated the contract with an\ninfluencer as a result of a flagrant catch, but these are very specific\ncases,\u201d says its founder. \u201cThe most significant consequence is that the people\nwho follow me are able to identify these unethical practices, which previously\nwent unnoticed.\u201d In this sense, Barreda says these kinds of profiles can help\nprofessionals in the sector to identify bad practices: \u201cWe must acknowledge\nthat some of these messages and publications sometimes help us to improve and\ndetect profiles that are not doing well, or campaigns that are not well\nexecuted and, therefore, make us keep a close eye on our own. Even so, as in\neverything, there are profiles that I like and others that I think cross the\nline. This sector is still very new and we have learned a lot from mistakes.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### \u2018Cleanfluencers\u2019 or why we are fascinated by content about cleaning on\nsocial media\n\nSusana Molina | Altea\n\n### Fitness, butts and Instagram stories: How exercise is sexualized on social\nmedia\n\nEnrique Alpa\u00f1\u00e9s | Madrid\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Instagram\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So wenig kosten Treppenlifte 2024 wirklichTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nUndo\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nUndo\n\nCheckfox\n\nGeheimer Tipp f\u00fcr Privatversicherte: So sparen Sie bis zu 50%!Checkfox|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nUndo\n\nAnd Also...\n\nUS pressure forces Israel to make first concession in six months of Gaza warEl\nPa\u00eds\n\nUndo\n\nAS\n\nShocking video: Taiwan earthquake creates waterfall from rooftop swimming\npoolAS\n\nUndo\n\nAS\n\nDashcam footage shows car crash involving Rashee RiceAS\n\nUndo\n\n_\n\n### newsletter\n\nSign up to EL PA\u00cdS in English Edition bulletin\n\nAp\u00fantate\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
