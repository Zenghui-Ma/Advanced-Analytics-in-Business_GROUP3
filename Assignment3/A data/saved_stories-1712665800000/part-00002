Until now I have usually responded by handing around Blickensderfer\ntypewheels or Hammond typeshuttles, in an effort to make the point that there\nwas nothing really new in the golfball \u2013 it was \u201cvery old typewriter\ntechnology\u201d.\n\nBlickensderfer typewheel\n\nYet many people today do, oddly enough, identify typewriters in general with\nthe golfball. It\u2019s almost as if it seems, to some, that the story of the\ntypewriter began and ended with the golfball. And in some ways, that\u2019s\nactually quite true.\n\nBut not the way IBM tells it. According to that mighty conglomerate, \u201cfor the\nfirst 90 years of typewriter technology, typebars proved to be the only\nefficient way to make an impression on a page\u201d. Try telling that to James\nBartlett Hammond and George Canfield Blickensderfer, if you dare!\n\nHammond typeshuttle\n\nIBM goes on, \u201cIn 1961, IBM introduced a revolutionary way to make a typewriter\nwork, and work well. This was the IBM Selectric typewriter, which replaced\ntypebars and moving carriages with a printing element, a sphere no larger than\na golfball, which bears all alphabet characters, numbers and punctuation\nsymbols.\u201d\n\nWow! Revolutionary? \u201cA sphere no larger than a golfball, which bears all\nalphabet characters, numbers and punctuation symbols\u201d Um, didn\u2019t Robert Thomas\ndo that in 1854? And John Pratt in 1866? And James Hammond in 1881? And Lucien\nStephen Crandall later that same year? And Charles Spiro (below) in 1885? And\nGeorge Blickensderfer in 1893? And Charles Bennett on a pocket typewriter in\n1907?\n\nCrandall typesleeve\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more: \u201cThe IBM Selectric typewriter, the machine that\nswitched typeface styles by changing its golfball ... quite simply\nrevolutionised the way in which the world typed. By using various Selectric\ntyping elements, a user could type away in Hebrew (done many years before on\nmanual portable typewriters) or in modern Greek (done years before), or in\nJapanese phonetic Katakana (done years before).\u201d\n\nCome on, IBM, tell us what really was so new about the Selectric! An electric\ntypewriter with a typewheel? Blickensderfer did that in 1902, almost six\ndecades before the Selectric.\n\nWell, OK, in terms of the \u201cend\u201d of typewriters, IBM\u2019s introduction of the\nSelectric a little more than half a century ago, on July 31, 1961 - almost\nexactly 87 years from the day the Sholes and Glidden first went on sale -\nprobably did spell the beginning of the end of production of the manual\ntypewriters that we all know and love.\n\nIn that regard, it's not surprising some people today see the Selectric as the\nbe all and end all of typewriters.\n\nMany seem to have been brainwashed by the bombardment of 1960s IBM propaganda,\nits heavy duty promotion and advertising for the Selectric, the so-called\n\u201cCadillac of typewriters\u201d. Indeed, the US Postal Service featured the\nSelectric in a \u201cPioneers of American Industrial Design\u201d stamp series.\n\nBut as for the \u201cbeginning\u201d of typewriters, regardless of what IBM might say\nnow, the IBM golfball\u2019s true genesis is officially recorded as dating back to\nJohn Jonathan Pratt, inventor of the 1866 \u201cPterotype\u201d (\u201cwinged type\u201d).\n\nPratt (above) patented his machine in the US on yesterday\u2019s date, August 11,\nin 1868, describing it as a \u201cmechanical typographer\u201d. Some historians regard\nthe Pterotype as the first practical typewriter ever produced, predating the\nSholes and Glidden by as many as five years. See\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/06/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\nxxxii.html\n\nIn its history of the creation of the golfballed Selectric, IBM passingly\nacknowledges the influence of the truly revolutionary Blickensderfer, the\nclassic styling lines of Olivetti (see\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/05/100-years-of-olivetti-\ntypewriters_04.html) and its need to buy the design patent for Louis Marx\u2019s\n1940s toy typewriter.\n\nThe Marx toy typewriter in question, by the way, was designed by Ray Lohr, who\nwas educated Xavier University in Cincinnati, where noted typewriter collector\nand historian Richard Polt, one of oztypewriter\u2019s best friends, is now\nprofessor of philosophy.\n\nIBM even overlooks the efforts of one of its own finest servants, the\nbrilliant and uber prolific Frederick Merchant Carroll. As the Selectric was\nbeing developed by much younger men in Poughkeepsie, a little further north-\nwest in New York, at IBM\u2019s laboratory in Binghamton, the then 86-year-old\nCarroll was working on a \u201cmoveable drum typewriter\u201d, using a much more\nconventional typewheel on an IBM electric typewriter. Carroll\u2019s design (below)\nwas patented on this day in 1958, when he was 89.\n\nCarroll died on October 30, 1960, aged 91. The Selectric was still nine months\naway from the marketplace. In the excitement of that final period of a 15-year\ndevelopment program to produce the Selectric, Carroll\u2019s input, the last\nripening of fruit from 64 years of inventing, was sadly forgotten.\n\nOther than its slight nod to the Blick, Olivetti and Marx, IBM keeps the\nbackground information on the Selectric \u201cin-house\u201d, in Poughkeepsie,\nmentioning the IBM design and mechanical engineers involved but ignoring the\noriginal ideas that flowed into the Selectric from such legendary great\ntypewriter inventors as John Pratt and Charles Spiro.\n\nIBM\u2019s official history has the genesis of the golfball dating from 1946. IBM\nsays: \u201cThe pedigree for the golfball element goes back to 1946 and an\numbrella-shaped development model in Poughkeepsie, New York, called a\n\u2018mushroom printer\u2019.\u201d But that is only partially true. The people who actually\npatented the golfball itself, on July 21, 1959, referenced a design Pratt had\nassigned to James Bartlett Hammond on June 21, 1892 (below).\n\nPratt had, of course, used a typewheel in his Pterotype and sold the rights to\nit to Hammond in 1878. Ensuing legal action by Hammond against Lucien Stephen\nCrandall forced Crandall to adapt the typewheel into an elongated typesleeve,\ncoming up with something typewriter historian Michael Adler links to Robert\nThomas\u2019s 1854 Typograph (below). See\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/07/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\nli.html\n\nThe \u201cinventors\u201d of the golfball were John E. Hickerson, Ralph E. Page and\nJames A. Weldenhammer, working for IBM in Poughkeepsie. They had applied for\nthe patent on November 17, 1955 (below). IBM workers initially referred to it\nas the \u201cflying walnut\u201d, or \u201cbouncing ball\u201d.\n\nApart from Pratt\u2019s design for the Hammond, this team also referenced a\ntypewheel typewriter designed by George H. Treadgold (1859-1925), of Port\nHuron, Michigan, in 1898, and a typographic machine designed in 1902 by the\nfamous Hartford, Connecticut, inventor Francis Henry Richards (born 1850)\nwhich Richards had assigned to the American Typographic Corporation of New\nJersey.\n\nRichards\n\nThat\u2019s another part of the real heritage of the Selectric, at least as far as\nthis particular style of single type element is concerned. The technology of\nhow to operate it is an entirely different story. IBM largely gives the credit\nfor this to Horace Smart \"Bud\" Beattie (1909-1993).\n\nAccording to a 1961 advertisement for the Selectric, Beattie's Ploughkeepsie\nteam \u201cbegan their search by forgetting the past 50 years of typewriter\ndesign\u201d. Judging by its patent references, however, that is a very long way\nfrom the truth! Or maybe it forgot the immediately preceding 50 years, then\nremembered the previous 50 years, going back to the 1850s? Under Beattie\u2019s\ndirection, Hickerson \"revised the typehead toward its ultimate spherical\nconfiguration\". Beattie (above), who was to become vice-president of\nengineering in the office products division of IBM, graduated from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He started with IBM in June 1933,\nworking under Carroll, and retired after more than 40 years. Beattie worked\nsubsequently as a consultant. He received the American Society of Mechanical\nEngineers Medal in 1971 and the Engineering Citation of the Society of\nManufacturing Engineers in 1973. He was elected to the National Academy of\nEngineering in 1976.\n\nDescribed as \u201cthe proverbial engineer's engineer [and] well ahead of his\ntime\u201d, Beattie was IBM\u2019s lab director at its new Electric Typewriter Division\nin Lexington, Kentucky, in 1957. There he completed what IBM president Thomas\nJohn Watson (below) called \"the most totally distinct invention we've ever\nmade as a company\" \u2014 the single-element printer. \"This,\" Watson said, \"is the\nmost significant change in typing in 120 years.\"\n\nThe Selectric was said to have been \u201cthe basis for countless printers and led\nto IBM's memory typewriters and correcting typewriters. In a 1986 article on\noffice communications, USA Today said Beattie \u2018changed the office landscape\nforever\u2019.\u201d\n\nWatson rated Beattie one of the three best design engineers and inventors ever\nto work for IBM. I wonder if Carroll was another? Beattie recalled later the\nmoment Watson first saw the golfball operate: \u201cWe were in the old Kenyon House\nin Poughkeepsie. [Watson] came in and asked me what I was doing. I said, \u2018I\u2019ve\ngot something I\u2019d like to show you.\u2019 We went down into the bowels of that old\nmansion, to the little room where John Hickerson was tinkering with the\nmushroom [typehead] ... John turned it on, and it started to bob and wobble\naround. Mr Watson sat there mesmerised. Then he broke out laughing and said,\n\u2018Bud, you must have been drunk when you designed that thing!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat Watson saw in 1954 was the operation of a development of the \u201cmushroom\nprinter\u201d (above) to which the IBM history refers - the \u201cumbrella-shaped\ndevelopment model in Poughkeepsie\u201d. IBM says, \u201cThe intent had been to use it\nas a printer on an IBM accounting machine. Earlier versions did see some\naction with the IBM Stretch computer [before being applied to the Selectric\ntypewriter].\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. Beattie had applied for a patent for this\ndevice, calling it a \u201chigh speed printing mechanism\u201d, on February 17, 1948,\nand the patent was issued on December 8, 1953.\n\nIn filing his application, Beattie referred to many earlier inventions,\nstarting with some astonishing typewriter designs from a Charles Hire Perry\n(born Vermont, June 25, 1844), a doctor in Oneida, New York. The designs\n(above) date from 1887, and Perry had assigned them to Thomas Redfield Proctor\n(1844-1920, below), a wealthy Utica, New York, banker and businessman who\nbacked Perry\u2019s enterprises.\n\nCompare the Beattie and Perry configurations:\n\nBeattie (left) Perry (right)\n\nOther earlier typewriter designs to which Beattie referred were by the noted\nFreeport, Illinois, inventor, manufacturer and banker Daniel Carroll Stover\n(1839-1908, below) and London-based Scottish politician James Dundas White\n(1866-1951), as well as another quite remarkable machine, this one from\nLithuanian-born Saul Aronson of New York.\n\nStover\u2019s designs date from 1888 (IBM failed to cite Stover's original\n\"mushroom\" patent, below), White\u2019s date from 1902 and Aronson\u2019s from 1907.\n\nStover 1888\n\nStover's second patent, 1891\n\nAronson\n\nPut aside the claims that Beattie got the idea of the mushroom-shaped type\nelement from changing a light bulb at home. The Perry, Stover and Aronson\nmachines all used convex type elements, giving Beattie the basis for his\n\u201cmushroom\u201d printer. In fact, they are all almost identical to Beattie\u2019s\ndesign.\n\nAdler in Antique Typewriters (1997) called the Perry design (above)\n\u201cinteresting\u201d and said the idea was \u201can index of lenticular section comparable\nto the Lambert but manipulated by means of vertical joy-stick\u201d. Adler said of\nWhite (who he mistakenly called \u201cJ.G.Whyte\u201d) \u201cA machine which typed around a\nvertical platen riding up on a spiral groove\u201d.\n\nBefore Hickerson was issued with a patent for a \u201ckey-operated machine\u201d [the\nSelectric, sans an inking component] on April 4, 1961 (above), Hickerson and\nPage had been part of a team headed by Leon E. Palmer which patented a \u201csingle\nelement printing machine\u201d on March 31, 1959 (below).\n\nThis shows clear evidence of the way in which the golfball \u201cwobbled\u201d on its\nstem. Because the Selectric\u2019s platen remained stationary, the type element\u2019s\nface needed to be curved so that all three lines of type could strike the\nplaten squarely. A straight-edged typewheel could not have achieved this\nwithout the platen moving up and down to accommodate each line.\n\nIt is in these areas that the Lohr-Marx patent (above) came into play. It was\nvery much still in force at the time the Palmer team\u2019s patent was applied for\non November 17, 1955. At that time, Palmer and Co referenced an unusual 1931\ntypewheel typewriter designed by Gustave Teissedre of Strasbourg-Alsace in\nFrance and first patented in Germany (below). The typewheel was rotated by a\ncurved arm.\n\nPalmer and Co also referenced a typewriter (below) designed by Charles A.\nFuchs for the Burnell Laboratory Company of Locust Valley, New York, in 1935.\nThis used as typewheel on a pivoted arm.\n\nThe Palmer team\u2019s patent has a rounded type element inked by adjoining ribbon\nspools. This method was used, for example, on the Teletype Model 26 (see\nbelow).\n\nPalmer developed the character-selection system for the Selectric. IBM says,\n\"This system provided for fixed units of motion controlled by mathematical\nratios. Palmer was made an IBM Fellow \u2014 the highest honor IBM bestows on a\nscientist, engineer or programmer, and an elite group handpicked by the CEO \u2014\nfor his contributions to the Selectric. He holds the majority of the patents\nthat resulted from the development of the original machine.\"\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cback at the ranch\u201d, as they say in the classics: While Beattie and\nhis team in Poughkeepsie were working on their \u201cmushroom printer\u201d, in\nBinghamton, one of IBM\u2019s oldest and most gifted hands was coming up with one\nlast, magnificent design.\n\nFor Frederick Merchant Carroll (above), this \u201cmovable drum typewriter\u201d would\nbe a parting gesture for the company he had served so well, and so profitably,\nfor 41 years. Carroll\u2019s patent, for which he had made an application on\nJanuary 5, 1955, was aimed in the same direction as Beattie\u2019s single type\nelement printing, except it was for a typewriter \u2013 and he was using a three-\nline typewheel, identical to those used on Blicks and Bennetts.\n\nCarroll wrote in his application that his typewriter would have \u201ctype\ncharacters .. arranged on a drum or other printing member which is moved under\ncontrol of selector elements, such as type keys ...\u201d Bear in the mind that at\nthis time, the Poughkeepsie team was headed toward an accounting machine or\nthe massive Stretch computer, not a typebar typewriter. Also, Carroll was\nusing a typewheel (or typeball) that rotated and pivoted. For his references\nin his design, Carroll pointed way back, to Charles Spiro\u2019s 1885 typewheel\ntypewriter (below).\n\nDuring a career spanning 61 years, Carroll took out 97 patents. These included\nan IBM typewriter in 1943. He was still being issued with patents a year after\nhis death. Carroll was born in Union City, Ohio, in 1869, the son of an\ninventor (David Carroll), and he started taking out his own patents in 1896.\nHis first was for a cyclometer.\n\nAt the turn of the century, Carroll moved to New Haven, Connecticut, were he\nworked on adding machines and calculators, then to Dayton, Ohio, to work for\nthe National Cash Register Company. In 1916 he joined the Tabulating Machine\nCompany, one of the organisations which later emerged into IBM, at the Product\nDevelopment Laboratory in Endicott, New York. He subsequently worked in\nYorkers then Binghamton. During his time at IBM, Carroll developed rotary type\npresses, an automatic high-speed rotary card manufacturing machine, the\nautomatic ledger posting \u201ccompensating\u201d carriage, a \"unit counter\", a small\nelectromechanical device that acted as a single adding wheel, and other\naccounting machines. He introduced a photoelectric sensing apparatus. It is\nsaid that he \u201chelped to revolutionise the entire business machines industry\u201d.\n\nAmong the people he had worked closely with at IBM was Eugene Amzi Ford,\ninventor of the Ford typewriter (above). See\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/07/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\nlxvix.html\n\nFred M. Carroll, left, Eugene A. Ford, right\n\nFinally, we come to the Marx toy typewriter (below), designed in 1939 by\nRaymond John Lohr of Erie, Pennsylvania (ironically, George Canfield\nBlickensderfer\u2019s home town).\n\nRobert William Bemer (above), a computer scientist at IBM, recalled, \u201cOne day\nduring initial Selectric production at Lexington, Kentucky, the honoured\ntouring guest was Mr [Louis] Marx, of Marx Toys [see the cover of Time,\nbelow], grinning ear to ear. The reason? IBM had purchased the rights to his\ntoy typewriter for children as a large basis for their [Selectric] design.\u201d\n\nLohr\u2019s design is for an enlarged version of the well-known Junior toy\ntypewriter, the patent for which had been held in Germany. But bear this in\nmind: Marx did not own the patent for the more familiar \u201cstemmed\u201d Marx toy\ntypewriter, which it produced under licence from Samuel I. Berger of Newark\n(apparently Marx and Berger \u201cswapped\u201d a lot of designs in the 1930s). The\npatent on the Berger typewriter had expired in 1949, anyway, while the Lohr\npatent was still very much in force in 1957, at a time when development of the\nSelectric was in full flow.\n\nLohr, who also designed the Big Wheel and Rockem-Sockem Robots for Marx, was\nborn in Cincinnati in 1912. At 23, he was hired as a mechanical designer by\nLouis Marx and Company Toys in Erie, retiring after a 37-year career in 1972\nas chief toy designer in 1972. He died in Erie on October 3, 2005, aged 93.\n\nThe Selectric\u2019s body was the work of influential American designer Eliot Fette\nNoyes (1910-1977), of New Canaan, Connecticut (below).\n\nBoston-born Noyes created a number of design projects for IBM. He studied\narchitecture at Harvard (1932-1938) and worked as a curator at the Museum of\nModern Art and as director of industrial design. After World War II, Noyes was\ndesign director with Norman Bel Geddes, for whom Royal typewriter designer\nHenry Dreyfuss had served his apprenticeship in the early 1920s. When Bel\nGeddes' office closed in 1947, one of the unfinished projects was a Model A\nelectric typewriter for IBM. Noyes opened his own office and finished the job\nfor IBM. He was retained in 1948 by Thomas Watson for IBM product design and\nin 1956 developed a unique IBM corporate style and image similar to Olivetti.\nHe did so with help from Paul Rand, Marcel Breuer and Charles Eames.\n\nIn his design for the Selectric, Noyes referenced earlier IBM machines and the\nwork of Frederic S. Grover, Theodore G. Clement and Carl W. Sundberg. Notably,\nhowever, he also referred to Laird Fortune Covey\u2019s FP design for Royal. See\nhttp://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2011/06/on-this-day-in-typewriter-history-\nxxxvi.html Selectrics and their descendants eventually captured 75 per cent of\nthe United States market for electric typewriters used in business. It is\nestimated 13 million were sold worldwide up to 2002 (though production\nofficially ended in 1987). The Selectric was succeeded by the Wheelwriter in\n1984 and IBM transferred its typewriter business to the newly formed Lexmark\nin 1991.\n\nAt the end of the day, the IBM Selectric was first and foremost a team effort,\ninvolving not just Beattie but Hickerson, Palmer and many other IBM design,\nmechanical and electronic engineers. But there was very little, if anything,\nin its make-up that was entirely unique. Its genes go back to Robert Thomas,\nJohn Pratt and James Hammond \u2013 in other words, more than 100 years before the\nSelectric was actually made.\n\nPosted by Robert Messenger at 16:18\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n#### 9 comments:\n\nRichard P said...\n\n    \n\nOne of your most impressive research articles so far! It far exceeds anything\nelse I've seen about the Selectric.\n\nIt's quite interesting to see the early patents for \"wobbling\" type elements\nthat tilt to use different rows of characters. The only such machine that I\nwas familiar with is the Lambert.\n\nI think from now on I'll call the IBM element a \"flying walnut.\"\n\n    15 August 2011 at 04:37\n\nRobert Messenger said...\n\n    \n\nThank you, Richard, this is very kind (and of course encouraging). As you may\nimagine, a lot of elements, so a lot of time and effort, putting me way behind\nschedule again. But your comments help make it worthwhile. I have added in an\n1888 Stover 'mushroom' design which the IBM people failed to cite, for some\nreason. By sheer luck I stumbled across it while researching August 13. I was\na bit surprised they didn't reference the Lambert. But it is fascinating to\nsee such unfamiliar designs as those by Perry, Aronson etc, and uncover\ncharacters like Ray Lohr of Cincinnati. Like you, when I saw it I thought\n\"flying walnut\" was a far better name than golfball.\n\n    15 August 2011 at 08:19\n\nnotagain said...\n\n    \n\nFabulous research. I get a lot out of these posts. You should bind them\ntogether in book (or calendar) form after a year. I find it interesting that\nthey continued to produce typebar machines competing with the selectric, like\nthe one I found yesterday. http://manualentry.blogspot.com/2011/08/did-not-\nbuy-this-one.html\n\n    15 August 2011 at 09:02\n\nRobert Messenger said...\n\n    \n\nThank you, notagain, you are very kind and I'm naturally delighted and\nencouraged to know that you get something from these posts. I have been\nthinking along the lines of a biographical dictionary on typewriter inventors\nfor 2014, to mark 300 years since Henry Mill. Might have to start saving up\nsomething apart from words for that, though. Yes, it is interesting about the\nmanual IBM. Apparently Bemer wanted to expand the golfball, with ASCI in mind,\nbut IBM told him the Selectric would only ever be a \"correspondence\" machine!\nIBM was actually taken by surprise by its immediate sales success, though it\ndoesn't like to admit that now!\n\n    15 August 2011 at 09:32\n\nUnknown said...\n\n    \n\nThere's a few reasons why IBM continued selling typebar machines after the\ndebut of the Selectric.\n\n1\\. Price - a Model C with a 13\" carriage cost $460 in 1962, a Selectric 723\n(13\" platen, 11\" writing line) cost $475, and a 725 (15\" platen, 13\" writing\nline) cost $495. Fast forward to the Model D (with 12.5\" carriage)'s debut in\n1967, at $490, and the 723 was $500, 725 was $520. And, in 1969, it was $510\nfor the D, $520 for the 723, and $540 for the 725.\n\n2\\. Speed - While the Selectric is faster for ordinary typists that aren't\ntrained in how to run a typebar typewriter properly (myself included), a fast\ntypist can get a burst of speed that out-types a Selectric. 15.5 characters\nper second is the most a Selectric can do - that means that if it takes you\nless than 64.5 ms for a character (or, the other way, if you burst at over 186\nwpm), you're out-typing the machine. (If you do a 2-character burst and then\nslow after that, it's no problem, the machine can absorb that in the\ninterposer system, but a *3*-character burst - that is, selecting the third\ncharacter less than 129 ms after selecting the first character - and now\nyou're slowed down by the machine.) Experienced typebar typists could keep the\ncadence such that multiple typebars were in flight but not colliding, and\nworld records were set on IBM typebar machines (but never the Selectric\nAFAIK). IBM didn't want to lose that market.\n\n3\\. Executive - while the Selectric was IBM's \"flagship\", it was also a mid-\nrange machine (although the cheapest machine they sold, from the day the\nSelectric debuted, was the Selectric 721/711). The bottom of the line was\nshared by the 11\" platen Selectrics and the typebar machines, and the top of\nthe line was exclusively the domain of the proportional spacing Executive\ntypebar machines. The typebar machines didn't go away until IBM came up with a\nproportional spacing Selectric that was suitable for office use (the Mag Card\nExecutive).\n\n    14 October 2012 at 05:06\n\nUnknown said...\n\n    \n\nAnd, of course, I post that before checking...\n\nThe CURRENT world record typing speed (over 1 minute in this case) is 216 wpm.\n\nSet by Stella Pajunas, in 1946... on an IBM electric. That thing was being\ndriven harder than a Selectric's theoretical max.\n\n    14 October 2012 at 05:13\n\nquadibloc said...\n\n    \n\nI have used a VariTyper, and so I know that typing on it is slow compared to\ntyping on a conventional manual typewriter, and the keys require considerably\nmore force to press. So, although I have no direct experience with the\nBlickensderfer, I would dare to tell Mr. Hammond, at least, that the Selectric\ndid bring something new to the table, even if it certainly was not the very\nidea of a single element typewriter.\n\n    15 October 2016 at 13:23\n\nMarcin said...\n\n    \n\nI have not much to add, except: what a fantastic article this is.\n\n    4 May 2017 at 02:30\n\nquadibloc said...\n\n    \n\nCome to think of it, though, the statement by IBM did contain an error. While\nI would dare to say that typebars were efficient in a way that the typing\nelements of Hammond and Blickensderfer were not - unlike the Selectric\ntypeball - that efficiency didn't really encompass the entire \"first 90 years\nof typewriter technology\".\n\nSome time elapsed between Remington and Sholes (which is presumably where IBM\nstarted counting from) and the introduction of the Underwood Five.\n\n    29 January 2019 at 01:23\n\nPost a Comment\n\nNewer Post Older Post Home\n\nSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)\n\n## Translate\n\nPowered by Google \u00dcbersetzer\n\n## Search This Blog\n\n## My Blog List\n\n  * To Type, Shoot Straight, and Speak the Truth...\n\nType-In Report: Chandler Library Type-In - Currently in the earholes:\n\n1 day ago\n\n  * Welcome to the Typosphere\n\nWoz Flint book signing & type-in in Cincinnati, April 29 - Woz Delgado Flint\ndiscussing and signing The Distraction-Free First Draft + type-in!
