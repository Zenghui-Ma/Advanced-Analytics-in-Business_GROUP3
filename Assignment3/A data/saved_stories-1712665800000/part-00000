Hence TSAC compresses a 3.5 minute stereo song to a file of 192 KiB.\n\nAn Nvidia GPU is necessary for fast operation. CPU only is also supported but\nslower.\n\n## Compression Results\n\nThe audio extracts are from here.\n\nWaiting (Pops):\n\noriginal| stereo 7.26 kb/s| mono 5.61 kb/s| stereo 2.99 kb/s  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nGreatest_Love_of_All_2min57 (Pops):\n\noriginal| stereo 6.79 kb/s| mono 5.02 kb/s| stereo 2.84 kb/s  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n9-Have-big-expensive-car.441 (Pops):\n\noriginal| stereo 7.81 kb/s| mono 5.91 kb/s| stereo 3.25 kb/s  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n21-classic.441 (Classic):\n\noriginal| stereo 6.21 kb/s| mono 4.71 kb/s| stereo 2.57 kb/s  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n4-Sound-English-male.441 (Voice):\n\noriginal| mono 6.79 kb/s| mono 3.74 kb/s| mono 2.18 kb/s  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n## Download\n\n  * Linux version: tsac-2024-04-08.tar.gz. (readme.txt)\n  * Windows version (experimental): tsac-2024-04-08-win64.zip.\n\n## Technical information\n\n  * tsac is based on a modified version of the Descript Audio Codec extended for stereo and a Transformer model to further increase the compression ratio. Both models are quantized to 8 bits per parameter.\n  * The Transformer model is evaluated in a deterministic and reproducible way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact GPU or CPU model nor on the number of configured threads. This key point ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a different hardware or software configuration.\n\nFabrice Bellard - https://bellard.org/\n\n", "frontpage": true}
