The earthquake disrupted wafer fab operations, impacting supply as\nMicron, Samsung Electronics, and SK Hynix are among those affected, reports\nDigiTimes. This situation may lead to sharper price increases than\nanticipated, as the industry was already aiming for higher prices before the\nquake, in a bid to recoup losses memory makers incurred in the previous years.\n\nMicron ceased offering product quotes for the second quarter, shortly after\nthe earthquake, with its Korean rivals quickly following suit. Industry\ninsiders revealed that these leading memory chip manufacturers had already\ninitiated measures to maintain a rising trend in their product prices before\nthe April 3 quake. Now, it seems highly probable that the price hikes may be\nmore pronounced than previously expected.\n\nIn the past, memory prices have typically surged following production\ndisruptions caused by natural calamities or accidents. The latest incident\ncould provide the vendors with chances to compensate for the losses incurred\nin 2022 and 2023. Prior to the quake, second-quarter DRAM and NAND flash\ncontract prices were experiencing slower growth compared to the first quarter.\nSpecifically, NAND flash prices had risen by 15% - 20% for the second quarter,\nas opposed to over 20% in the first quarter.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, Micron announced that it would evaluate the impacts\non its local production and supply chain. The company stated that it would\nthen discuss supply schedules with its customers, hinting at potential changes\nin supply. Industry sources mentioned that memory fabs typically halt\nproduction during such strong earthquakes, which affects supply of memory\nwafers.\n\nMemory module manufacturers, who are reportedly low on chip inventory, are now\npreparing for increased chip purchase costs. They had hoped that the rising\nprice trends would decelerate, given the rising capacity utilization rates at\nchip suppliers. However, chip suppliers had significantly reduced production\nto sustain pricing last year, when demand was stagnant. Downstream customers,\nincluding server makers, might become aggressive in stocking memory products\nin anticipation of shortages, further driving up prices.\n\nAlthough contract prices might be soaring, the spot market remains weak due to\nlow demand from the consumer sector following the Lunar New Year. Apparently,\nthere is still an abundant supply in the spot market, despite the disruptions\nand anticipated price hikes in the contract market, the report claims.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Second off, just because the machinery was undamaged, it doesn't mean\na batch didn't get ruined from an unexpected interruption.\n\nBut yes, the earthquake offers plausible deniability to increase prices.\n\nReply\n\n  * DavidLejdar\n\n> Notton said:\n>\n> First off, that was TSMC that sent its workers back to work, and TSMC\n> doesn't do DRAM.

I.e. company A gets supplied from\ncompanies B and C, of which company B has a landslide between them and the\nport, and company C needs to recalibrate a production line.\n\nIn any case, when a company has an annual revenue of $70bn from production\nthere, that comes down to about $8 million per hour. And production being\nhalted for 10 hours, $80 million right there \"lost\".\n\nAdd to this, that in Hualien Port as of yesterday, out of 26 terminals, 18\nwere not operating. This port in particular has seen some damages, such as\nground cracking and sinking, including impact on buildings, where the repairs\ndo not have the same priority as rescuing people trapped in tunnels.\n\nAnd this port last year handled nearly 8.83 million tonnes of cargo (and\nthousands of cruise passengers). This may now mean, that a lot of the cargo\ngets redirected to other ports, which in turn may face some logistical\nchallenges due to that.\n\nAnd all that may quickly mean, that a single company runs hundreds of millions\nof $ short of what they meant to have this year (and already planned for to\nspend), with additional expenses, such as due to logistics.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nBest Buy Geek Squad agents raise specter of mass layoffs in unofficial\ncommunity forums \u2014 some may have been displaced by AI\n\nBy Roshan Ashraf ShaikhApril 07, 2024\n\nChinese gov't pushes Huawei's HarmonyOS hard, sets adoption targets to beat\nWindows, Android, and iOS\n\nBy Anton ShilovApril 07, 2024\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot image tool generates ugly Jewish stereotypes, anti-Semitic\ntropes\n\nBy Avram PiltchApril 07, 2024\n\nRazer Blade 18 comes with an eye watering $4,799 price tag \u2014 comes armed with\ni9-14900HX and RTX 4090\n\nBy Mark TysonApril 07, 2024\n\nMicrosoft stifles third-party interface customization apps in Windows 11\nVersion 24H2\n\nBy Roshan Ashraf ShaikhApril 07, 2024\n\nMicronics' SLS 3D printer aims to take SLS mainstream \u2014 boasts a desktop form\nfactor and a relatively low $2,999 price\n\nBy Christopher HarperApril 07, 2024\n\nAIO workstation has 128 CPU cores and 28,416 GPU cores crammed into\nsurprisingly small form factor\n\nBy Anton ShilovApril 06, 2024\n\nNew thermal paste smells like flowers from heaven\n\nBy Roshan Ashraf ShaikhApril 06, 2024\n\nModder made an IRC client that runs entirely inside the motherboard's BIOS\nchip\n\nBy Christopher HarperApril 06, 2024\n\nNASA is confident it can recover the Voyager 1 but it'll require some time\n\nBy Christopher HarperApril 06, 2024\n\nMSI rolls out a new high-end Nvidia gaming GPU in China \u2014 GeForce RTX 4090D\n24G Ventus 3X comes as a more affordable option\n\nBy Aaron KlotzApril 06, 2024\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
