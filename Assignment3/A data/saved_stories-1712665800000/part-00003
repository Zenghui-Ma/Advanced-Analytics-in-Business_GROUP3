This version comes with the pacsync utility, which lets you automatically download and install packages and otherwise keep your system up to date.\n\nMar 13 - rsync server in place\n\n  * I've set up an rsync server on archlinux.org. This will let everybody keep their /usr/abs tree up to date, and it will also let you easily mirror the ftp site. I'm in need of download mirrors, so please, if anybody would like to volunteer, email me and I'll put you on the mirror page.\n\nIf you don't already have it, create the directory /usr/abs. Then to update\nyour /usr/abs tree, you can do the following:\n\n> >     # cd /usr/abs && rsync -av archlinux.org::abs .\n\nMar 11 - Arch Linux 0.1 (Homer) released\n\n  * I've finally got a bootable iso image on the ftp site. The bad news is that you don't get a pretty interactive installer. But if you wanted one of those, you would have gone with RedHat, right? ;)\n\nHere's a short list of some future plans for 0.2:\n\n    * Document ABS (Arch Build System) and provide a cvs-like update method so people can start building their own packages.\n    * Finish the contrib area and start posting third-party packages.\n    * Finish pacman 1.2 -- this will allow you to update your entire system with the latest stable version of all packages, all with one command.\n    * Add a pretty interactive installer. ;)\n    * Add more documentation -- our docs really suck right now. Please! If you have questions, just ask! Also, if you want to help out in any way, please let me know. I'm a student so my free time comes and goes at the will of my evil profs.\n\nI'll try to get the docs up for ABS (Arch Build System) which, IMHO, is one of\nthe best advantages of Arch. With ABS, you can easily create new packages, and\nit's trivial to rebuild existing packages with your own customizations.\n\nAnd on that note, if you start to use the ABS and build your own packages, I\nwelcome your submissions. My \"development team\" is working on a contrib area\nas we speak. ;)\n\nAbout\n\nArch Linux is an i686-optimized linux distribution based on ideas from CRUX, a\ngreat distribution developed by Per Lid\u00e9n. It is lightweight and contains the\nlatest stable versions of software. Packages are in .tar.gz format and are\ntracked by a package manager that is designed to allow easy package upgrades.\nArch is quite streamlined compared to some other distributions. Things that\nare relatively unused (by me, anyway) are not kept (info-pages, for example).\nA default Arch install leaves you with a solid base; from there, you can add\npackages to create the custom installation you're looking for. Arch has a\npackage build system that allows you to easily create your own packages, which\nmakes it very easy to rebuild a package with your own custom configuration.\nArch also aims to use the newer features available to linux users, such as\nreiserfs/ext3 and devfs.\n\nComponents\n\nAll components are optional, of course. It's your system -- build it however\nyou want.\n\n  * Linux Kernel 2.4.18\n  * XFree86 4.2.0\n  * glibc 2.2.5\n  * gcc 2.95.3\n  * OpenSSH 3.1p1\n  * Mozilla 0.9.9\n  * WindowMaker 0.80.0\n  * Vim 6.1\n  * Reiserfsprogs 3.x.1b\n  * devfsd 1.3.22\n  * ... and more ...\n\nMailing List\n\nThere is a mailing list in place for general discussion about Arch Linux.\nHere, you can post questions, problems, solutions, ideas, etc. To subscribe to\nthe list, send an email to arch-request@archlinux.org with subscribe as the\nsubject.\n\nAlternatively, you can click here to use the web interface.\n\nIRC\n\nThe project is still in its early stages of development. If you are one of\nthose brave souls who has installed it and you're seeking help, you can\nusually find me on #archlinux at irc.openprojects.net. My nick is apeiro.  \n  \nQuestions? Comments? Mail em here!\n\nCopyright \u00a92002, Judd Vinet <jvinet@zeroflux.org>\n\n", "frontpage": false}
