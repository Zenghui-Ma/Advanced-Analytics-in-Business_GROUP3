Nguyen, the FTC\u2019s Chief Technologist. \u201cThese exciting solutions show that a\nmulti-disciplinary approach is necessary to prevent the harms posed by voice\ncloning.\u201d\n\nThe panel of judges\u2014Princeton Computer Science Professor Arvind Narayanan,\nBritt Paris, assistant professor at Rutgers University\u2019s School of\nCommunication & Information, and Beau Woods, CEO of Stratigos Security and a\nCyber Safety Innovation Fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2014chose three top\nsubmissions from individuals and small organizations, who will split a total\nof $35,000 in prize money. They are:\n\n  * AI Detect: The submission from David Przygoda and Dr. Carol Espy-Wilson from the small organization OmniSpeech is aimed at consumer and enterprise apps and devices and would use AI to detect AI. It utilizes AI algorithms to distinguish the subtle differences between genuine and synthetic voice patterns.\n  * DeFake: Submitted by Dr. Ning Zhang, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, this proposal uses a form of watermarking. Given that voice cloning relies on the use of pre-existing speech samples to clone a voice, which are generally collected from social media and other platforms, the proposal calls for adding carefully crafted distortions to voice samples that are imperceptible to the human ear, but that make it more difficult to accurately clone.\n  * OriginStory: Submitted by Dr. Visar Berisha, Drena Kusari, Dr. Daniel W. Bliss, and Dr. Julie M. Liss of the small organization OriginStory, this technology aims to authenticate the human origin of voice recordings at the point of creation. It uses off-the-shelf sensors already integrated into many devices to simultaneously measure speech acoustics and the co-occurring biosignals in the throat and mouth that a person uses when speaking to validate the human origin and embed this authentication as a type of watermark into the audio stream.\n\nThe fourth winning submission is from a large organization, Pindrop Security,\nwhich received the Recognition Award. The Pindrop team was comprised of Dr.\nElie Khoury, Anthony Stankus, Ketuman Sardesai, and Amanda Braun. Pindrop\u2019s\nVoice Cloning Detection technology detects voice clones and audio deepfakes in\nreal time. The technology evaluates each incoming phone call or digital audio\nin two-second chunks and flags those that are potential deep fakes. (Large\norganizations were not eligible for monetary prizes.)\n\nThe four winning submissions demonstrate the potential for cutting edge\ntechnology to help mitigate risks of voice cloning in the marketplace. They\npromote innovative approaches on which key consumer protections can be built.\nAt the same time, the results of the challenge highlight that there is no\nsingle solution to this problem. Given this, in addition to the Voice Cloning\nChallenge, the FTC also has proposed a comprehensive ban on impersonation\nfraud, and has affirmed that the Telemarketing Sales Rule applies to AI-\nenabled scam calls.\n\nThis is the sixth challenge the FTC has launched under the America COMPETES\nAct aimed at spurring the development of innovative solutions to complex\nconsumer protection issues. Voice cloning technology offers potential benefits\nby, for example, providing new ways for those who have impaired speech to\ncommunicate in their own voice with the help of technology. But it also poses\nsignificant risks to consumers and has been utilized by scammers to\nimpersonate others. For example, scammers have used voice cloning technology\nto impersonate business executives in order to fraudulently obtain money or\nvaluable information.\n\nThe lead FTC staffers on this matter are James Evans and Christine Barker from\nthe FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection and Amritha Jayanti and Ben Swartz\nfrom the FTC\u2019s Office of Technology.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and\neducate consumers. The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to\ntransfer money, or promise you a prize.
