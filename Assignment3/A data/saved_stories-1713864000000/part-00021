Since Robarge only sells\ndirectly to customers, leaving out middle-man distributors, you can imagine\nhis surprise when someone contacted him about a faulty valve body they bought\nfrom Summit Racing. Robarge doesn't sell to Summit Racing, so he immediately\nknew something was awry. As he investigated further, he learned that another\ncompany was ripping off his designs and selling them through one of the\nautomotive industry's largest retailers.\n\nOn April 11, Robarge took to YouTube with two different valve bodies in hand:\nhis own and one that he bought from Summit. The latter came in a box with\nSpeedmaster branding, but inside, Robarge found a valve body with \"Broader\nPerformance\" machined into its face. He concluded that Speedmaster machined a\nvalve body identical to his own but either couldn't be bothered to remove the\nengraving or decided to use that branding for its gain.\n\nSpeedmaster is a large, international company. It maintains a presence at the\nannual SEMA show in Las Vegas and even partners with the NHRA. The company's\nCEO Jason Kencevski claims in a YouTube video that his father in Australia\nfounded the business in 1979 and has since sold 25,000 parts. However, he also\nsays \"The catch is, we're not sourcing 25,000 parts. We're actually designing,\nmanufacturing, testing 25,000 parts.\" Robarge's video suggests otherwise.\n\nHow did Robarge know that Speedmaster was machining its own version of his\ndesign? The tooling marks on the face of the valve bodies were different,\nproving that Speedmaster's didn't come from his shop. It's unclear how and why\nthis happened, though. It's possible that Speedmaster bought one of his\nproducts, 3D-scanned it, copied it, and sold it under its own brand rather\nthan licensing the design or developing its own.\n\nSummit Racing commented on Robarge's first video: \"We take the issue of\ncounterfeit and knock-off parts very seriously and were unaware of your\nexample until seeing this video. We put any inventory of the product detailed\nin your video on hold and have made it unsellable. We will review with\nSpeedmaster and take the necessary actions based on those conversations. Thank\nyou for making us aware.\"\n\nHowever, some forum members and Redditors rightly wondered why Summit never\nopened or inspected a Speedmaster parts box before doing business with the\ncompany. If Speedmaster copied Broader Performance, then it's possible that it\ncopies other brands as well.\n\nThe Drive has reached out to both Broader Performance and Speedmaster for\ncomment. We will update this story if either chooses to respond.\n\nIn a follow-up video, Robarge expressed his gratitude for all the support he's\nreceived from fans, customers, and the car-building community in general.\nSummit also followed up with another comment, saying it will no longer do\nbusiness with Speedmaster. \"All Speedmaster products have been removed from\nour website and from our sellable inventory,\" the company said on social\nmedia.\n\nRobarge suggests that Speedmaster is a Chinese company, and Kencevski claims\nthat it has three locations: Sydney, Los Angeles, and Shanghai. It's unclear\nwhere all of Speedmaster's parts come from; maybe different components are\nmanufactured in different countries. However, where the parts are made isn't\nthe issue. The issue lies with a big business like Speedmaster\u2014which has\nhundreds of thousands of followers on social media\u2014selling exact copies of a\npart that was designed and built in-house by a much smaller manufacturer. Not\nonly that, but it then sells those parts through massive international\nretailers like Summit.\n\nIs Broader Performance the only small business Speedmaster has copied? That's\nunclear at the moment. No other reports of such shady activity have been made.\nStill, there are several Reddit posts and YouTube videos of customers\ncomplaining about the quality of Speedmaster's parts.\n\nWithout a Summit customer reaching out to Robarge about a failing product, he\nwould have never known this was happening. Customers also would have been none\nthe wiser since the part still says \"Broader Performance\" on it. So if you're\nbuying a part from a small company that you trust, it's worth buying directly\nfrom that company, rather than a third-party retailer to ensure you know who\nyou're buying from.\n\nGot tips?
