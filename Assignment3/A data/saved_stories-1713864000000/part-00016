Here\u2019s how.\n\nbyAdam Ismail| PUBLISHED Apr 22, 2024 11:00 AM EDT\n\nNews\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nShare\n\n2\n\nAdam IsmailView adam ismail's Articles\n\nEA Sports' next Formula 1 game, F1 24, is set to drop on May 31. Aside from\nenhancements to the Career Mode and a few overhauled circuits (including Spa-\nFrancorchamps), one of the big focuses for this year's installment is\nhandling. Upgrades to the series' Dynamic Handling system go beyond the tire\nmodel, also impacting suspension kinematics, aero, and power unit behavior.\n\nIt starts with the chassis, as physics in F1 24 will now more accurately\nrepresent dynamic changes in camber and toe angle, roll centers, as well as\nanti-dive and anti-squat effects. Steering geometry as it relates to wheel\nloading has been paid attention to as well, and Senior Game Designer and\nVehicle Handling Lead Casey Ringley says the sum of these adjustments makes\nthe cars more predictable and intuitive to drive, \"providing useful feedback\nloops\" that exist in their real-life counterparts.\n\nTires receive more realistic slip curves and contact patch loading, which not\nonly impact feel but also tire wear over the course of a session. Better\nthermal representation and more detailed interaction with the environment\nshould translate to rubber that degrades more authentically than in previous\ngames, while tweaked wet-weather physics increase the grip floor with the\nobjective of making the cars less snappy on slippery surfaces.\n\nElectronic Arts\n\n\"One of the big changes we've made this year, particularly in the wet, is that\nwet tracks affect the tire slip curves,\" Ringley said in a media briefing\nattended by The Drive. \"Last year, we would just kind of scale them up and\ndown, so you had the same kind of performance drop-off post peak slip in the\nwet as in the dry. It made them very difficult to catch in the wet.\n\n\"Now, you're still losing grip, but it sort of rounds out the top of the slip\ncurves so you just have more control,\" Ringley added. The improved thermal\nsimulation will also have a knock-on effect on wet-weather racing, in the way\ncool, damp patches of the circuit off the racing line can extend the life of\ndisintegrating intermediates, for example.\n\nOn the aero side, Codemasters has used computational fluid dynamics data to\nbetter replicate the effect of slipstream and DRS usage, with the latter now\n\"more closely linked to\" rear-wing drag level\u2014as it should've always been,\nsince DRS is literally a mechanism of sacrificing rear downforce for top-end\nspeed.\n\nThe new DRS behavior is also said to vary depending on the aero profile of\neach team's car, meaning players shouldn't expect to see a blanket percentage\nspeed boost or grip loss when DRS is active across all constructors. Ringley\nsays that the strengths and weaknesses of each team's aero package\u2014for\nexample, Williams' predilection for low-downforce circuits in 2023, and Red\nBull and McLaren's relative prowess in mid-speed corners\u2014will be palpable in\ngameplay.\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nEngine braking is now something you can adjust like other parameters in the\ncar setup menu, impacting both energy harvesting and lift-and-coast\ncharacteristics. What's more, all Energy Recovery System mappings are\navailable in all sessions\u2014whether practicing, qualifying, or\nracing\u2014eliminating an odd quirk of previous releases. A new differential\ntoggle in the in-race multi-function display gives players further on-the-fly\nfreedom to enhance or diminish how aggressively ERS is deployed, depending on\nwhat a particular track or race strategy calls for.\n\nTaken together, these changes paint a picture of a comprehensive boon to\nphysics. When asked how the dynamics of F1 24's cars compare to those of\nprevious entries, Ringley highlighted F1 2020 as a \"great balance and good\nreference point for how the cars behave and respond to inputs.\" That should be\nmusic to fans' ears, as 2020 still tops many players' lists as the finest F1\nrelease of the modern era, particularly for its satisfying handling model.\nWe'll have more to say on F1 24 as we near the game's release in little more\nthan a month's time.\n\nGot tips?
