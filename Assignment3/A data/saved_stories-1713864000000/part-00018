And for every person who lives in\none. It does this by supporting the development of open-source projects, and\nopen connectivity and communication standards.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Our principles\n\n### Privacy\n\nControl your personal data.\n\nShare only what you want. With whom you want. Without modifying your behavior\nbecause of an algorithm. To ensure privacy, smart home devices must work\nlocally, and cloud services must be optional and opt-in.\n\n### Choice\n\nMix and match devices.\n\nAcross manufacturers. Without vendor lock-in, or arbitrary barriers to\ninteroperability. To ensure user choice, devices and the management of data\nthey gather should operate via open standards and local APIs.\n\n### Sustainability\n\nRepurpose your hardware.\n\nAnd reduce your environmental impact. To ensure sustainability, devices must\nbe built for durability, open to modification, and part of a system providing\ntools to track, automate, and reduce waste and emissions.\n\n## Our work\n\nThe Open Home Foundation owns and governs over 240 open-source projects,\nstandards, drivers, and libraries like Home Assistant, ESPHome, Zigpy, Piper,\nand more.\n\nIn the future, we aim to play a greater role as a political advocate for smart\nhome privacy, choice, and sustainability.\n\nPiper ESP Web Tools PyChromecast Wyoming BTHome Improv Wi-Fi Zigpy Python\nMatter Server\n\nSee more\n\n## Our collabs\n\nThanks to support from our partner Nabu Casa, we also collaborate on external\nmember projects that align with our principles.
