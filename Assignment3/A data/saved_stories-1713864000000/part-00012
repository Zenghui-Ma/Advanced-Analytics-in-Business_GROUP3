At its\ncore, the excise tax is an acknowledgment of the logistical effort borne by\nair traffic control whenever a rocket is launched\u2014an occurrence that is\nbecoming more common by the day, with the substantial increase in private\nsatellite deployments over the last decade.\n\nThe proposal is not merely a government money grab or a \u201ctax the rich\u201d penalty\nlevied on billionaire space entrepreneurs like Elon Musk\u2014it represents the\nfirst policy steps to address a growing concern that could very well redefine\nhow we allot and afford the use of near-Earth space.\n\nThe situation considered by the excise tax proposal takes a narrow view of a\nlarger problem. While increased burdens on air traffic control are an emergent\nissue, the problem tax policy is going to need to get its arms around in the\nensuing decades is the looming congestion of low-Earth orbit\u2014an unquestionably\nvast expanse that can nonetheless become perilously crowded if deployments\ncontinue at the current pace. An excise tax is a wise and necessary first\nstep, but it must be made with an eye towards a more comprehensive space tax\npolicy.\n\n## Space Tax\n\nThe budget proposal is functional first step to begin internalizing the\nexternalities wrought from private space flight\u2014the short-term costs are\nunquestionably most evident in air traffic control. Using the internalization\nof that cost as a wedge to pursue broader policy initiatives that ensure the\nongoing low-Earth congestion caused by increased satellite deployment is\ncalculated and compensated for is an excellent long-term solution.\n\nSimply applying the policies of property tax here on earth to space is fraught\nwith issues, as the space in low-Earth orbit lacks the metes and bounds one\ntypically expects for purposes of calculating and levying such a tax. Put\nsimply, it is difficult to put a value on a given area of space. But the core\nconcept is sound and translatable: that is, injecting market forces to ensure\nthe cost of deploying a satellite isn\u2019t solely limited to the launch and\ndeployment, but the \u201cspace\u201d taken up by the deployed satellite is also\naccounted and paid for.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Billionaire Mark Cuban Issues Post Halving Bitcoin Warning Amid\nUnprecedented Crypto Fee Price Chaos\n\n### AEW Dynasty 2024 Results Winners And Grades As Swerve Makes History\n\n### Who Is David Pecker Why He s Testifying Against Trump In Hush Money Trial\n\nThus, any space property tax must take into consideration things like the size\nof the satellite deployed, the lifespan of the satellite, and how it\u2019s safe\nremoval from operation has been designed for. The tax would encompass\ncompensation to society for the use of the space and a contribution to a fund\nfor mitigating future issues. The levied tax should thus also account for the\nfrequency of launches, the operational altitude of the satellite, and the\npotential for collision.\n\nOne policy element of a property tax is that it disincentivizes the\nunproductive use of land. A piece of prime real estate in an urban center that\nthe owner leaves as an empty lot will nonetheless have a property tax bill\nattached to it. The higher the property tax, the more motivated the owners are\nto make the most productive use of the property possible. The same can be\ntranslated to space, where an ongoing space property tax charged to the entity\nthat launches a satellite can help incentivize the productive use of that\nsatellite and the space it occupies\u2014and encourage satellite owners to plan for\nend-of-life removal.\n\nEnsuring there is an ongoing cost for a satellite in orbit makes certain that\nthe calculation for a would-be deployment is not simply whether the satellite\nis worth the cost of deployment, but whether it is worth the ongoing cost of\norbit. Such a tax can be part of a larger design and deployment policy,\nencouraging private companies to consider carefully the necessity and design\nof their satellites. These considerations must encompass everything from\nlimiting size to outlining end-of-life debris mitigation strategies, thereby\nmore generally promoting responsible and sustainable use of space.\n\n## International Component\n\nInternational collaboration and cohesive cross-border policymaking will be\nindispensable tenets of any success space tax policy. The challenge of\nmanaging low-Earth traffic and preventing congestion and collisions,\nobviously, transcends the surly bonds of earth\u2014much less national boundaries.\n\nExisting policy frameworks, such as the Outer Space Treaty and other policies\nof the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, already lay out\nfoundational principles for the peaceful use of space. As we venture further\nand the number of satellites multiplies exponentially, these agreements must\nevolve from their Cold War considerations towards sharing the burden of\nmonitoring, mitigating, and compensating for space debris.\n\nThe need for such cross-border cooperation is made clear by the inherently\nglobal impact of space activities\u2014from global communications to weather\nforecasting and defense, the continued productive use of low-Earth space is of\nthe utmost importance to each and every government. Consequently,\noverexploitation causes risks to all, from increasing risk of satellite\ncollision to the potential for significant disruption of satellite services,\nwith all the societal and political challenges that may ensue.\n\nAny successful space property tax policy will need to be developed and\nimplemented internationally, through dialog with the international community,\nnegotiation between stakeholders, and the establishment of shared objectives\nand concerns. This will not be without challenges\u2014after all, cross border tax\nissues have proven a thorny issue even here on boring old earth.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nIn the nascent stages of exploration and development, we seem to have a\nrecurring tendency to view new frontiers and the resources contained in them\nas limitless expanses. Often, unchecked exploitation follows. This has led to\nthe thoughtless consumption of bounties found here on earth\u2014from diverse\necosystems of newly discovered lands to the seemingly inexhaustible fauna we\nfind there. We have, as a species, treated the oceans as bottomless pits for\nwaste and the air we breathe as a relief valve for our toxins of industry.\n\nHistorically we have learned our lessons too late, but in the case of the\nproductive use of space we needn\u2019t\u2014we can make a shift towards sustainable\nstewardship now and head off the issue now, at the relative early days of\nprivate satellite deployment.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
