But good luck if you lose your job.\n\nMarco Bottigelli/Getty, Yevgen Romanenko/Getty, Maskot/Getty, Tyler Le/BI\n\nAki Ito\n\n2024-04-15T09:49:01Z\n\nFacebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link\n\nRead in app\n\nHOMEPAGE\n\nNewsletters\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\nEver since hordes of Americans began fleeing big coastal cities during the\npandemic, I've been wondering when \u2014 or if \u2014 they'd return. Sure, things are\nless expensive in the places they moved to, and the quality of life is often\nhigher. But more and more, urban refugees have been pining for the things they\nleft behind, from culinary excellence to cultural diversity. Every week it\nseems like I see a new story about some former San Franciscan or New Yorker\nregretting their decision to leave.\n\nSo recently, when the Census Bureau released its new estimates for domestic\nmigration, I thought we were finally going to see a reversal of the big-city\nexodus. But I was wrong. From mid-2022 to mid-2023, the bleeding in many big\nmetropolitan areas continued. New York lost 238,000 more people than it\ngained. The numbers read like casualty reports: 155,000 in Los Angeles, 54,000\nin San Francisco, 25,000 in Seattle. Granted, the urban flight isn't as bad as\nthe crisis-level hemorrhaging we saw in the first year of the pandemic. But\nevery day, hundreds and hundreds of people continue to forsake America's\ngreatest cities for smaller, more affordable destinations.\n\nWe've heard a lot about how the mass migration has been bad for major cities,\nsending them into a \"doom loop\" of empty offices and shuttered storefronts.\nBut a new paper coauthored by Enrico Moretti, one of the best thinkers on the\ngeography of jobs, highlights the dangers the migration poses for the very\nprofessionals who are ditching big cities. Moving away from a major city,\nMoretti found, can be terrible for your career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoretti, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, followed\nworkers whose companies shut down between 2010 and 2017. How people fared\nafter that depended on where they lived. Those who lived in small labor\nmarkets were less likely to find a new job within a year than those in large\nlabor markets. To get back on their feet professionally, those in small\nmarkets were more likely to be forced to relocate for employment. They were\nalso more likely to settle for a role that was misaligned with their college\ndegree, or in an entirely different industry.\n\n\"The big takeaway is that market size matters,\" Moretti says. \"It's clear that\nlarger markets improve the quality of the match.\"\n\nThat's precisely why workers and the companies that employ them tend to\ncluster in the same cities. Economists call it agglomeration. Let's say you're\na coder specializing in AI. You're far more likely to find a job in San\nFrancisco than you are pretty much anywhere else in the world, because there\nare a lot of AI-related companies there. And it's because AI specialists flock\nto San Francisco that AI businesses set up shop there in the first place.\nThat's how cities become hubs for particular industries, like finance in New\nYork and fashion in Paris. And that's why people put up with all the downsides\nof cities \u2014 because it increases their odds of growing their careers.\nMoretti's new paper confirms that when it comes to jobs, geography is destiny.\n\nAt first it seemed as though the pandemic had rewritten that rule. With the\nrise of remote work, professionals thought they could afford to leave their\nexpensive cities without a risk to their careers. If you moved to Des Moines\nand wound up losing your job, you could just stay put and get another work-\nfrom-home gig. Your house might be in Iowa, but your job market was still back\nin California or New York.\n\nBut over the past year, more and more employers have stopped hiring for remote\nroles. The market for WFH jobs has cratered, putting everyone who moved away\nfrom big cities at risk. If they wind up getting laid off or they outgrow\ntheir current role, living in a smaller job market is going to severely limit\ntheir career options. As Moretti's paper shows, they'll either (1) wind up\nunemployed for a long stretch, (2) be forced to settle for a local job they're\noverqualified for, or (3) have to make an abrupt and costly move back to the\nbig city they abandoned.\n\nMoretti characterizes being in a large labor market as \"insurance\" against\nfuture shocks. Living in a big city isn't just about having a good job right\nnow. It's what sets you up for success to land your next job \u2014 and the job\nafter that. Those who moved away from big cities effectively gave up their\ncareer insurance.\n\nAnd that's not all they gave up. When you live in an industry hub, you're\nsurrounded by professional peers, making it easier for you to accumulate\nknowledge and skills. That's not just because you get to collaborate in person\nwith your coworkers every day. In a big city, you also run into people who\nwork for other companies in your industry \u2014 on the bus, at the bar, in line at\nthe deli. Those serendipitous conversations not only expand your professional\nnetwork, they also create what economists refer to as \"knowledge spillovers,\"\nhelping you learn new stuff that's relevant to your work. That's why\ninnovation, as measured by patents, is higher in large markets, and why\nbusinesses in big cities tend to have higher productivity.\n\nThese upsides to living in a big hub are less obvious than the low rents and\nnice homes that have lured so many professionals to smaller cities. They also\ntake time to manifest \u2014 you have to lose your job before you realize how hard\nit will be to find another. So professionals haven't come to grips yet with\nwhat they gave up by moving away. \"The benefits of being a big city,\" Moretti\ntells me, \"have been underappreciated\" during the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil recently, I was one of those underappreciators. In 2021, my remote job\nallowed me to move from San Francisco to Sacramento for my then-wife's job. We\ncould suddenly afford a spacious two-bedroom in an apartment complex with a\npool, and I loved the slower pace of life. Even after we split up, my initial\nplan was to stay in Sacramento. But as I started driving into San Francisco\nmore often to meet with sources in the tech industry, I realized that being in\nthe city was helping me come up with better story ideas. So a few months ago,\nI moved back to the Bay Area. Being here makes me better at my job. And if I\nshould lose my job at some point, I know my search will go much better here,\nwhere there are more journalism jobs, than it would if I had stayed in\nSacramento.\n\nOf course, lots of professionals who left big cities during the early days of\nremote work will stay where they are, even if they lose their jobs. After all,\none of the other trends spurred by the pandemic was the realization that\ncareer isn't everything. Plenty of people will be happy to settle for a lesser\njob if it means they don't have to sit in soul-crushing traffic and can have a\nbig backyard for their kids.\n\nBut Moretti thinks the exodus from big cities is nearing an end. As the\noutward migration slows, he predicts, new people looking for career\nopportunities will flood into urban areas, more than making up for the people\nwho left. The big hubs will resume agglomerating, just as they did in the\ndecades leading up to the pandemic. Cities, in short, will be cities again.\n\n\"It's more a matter of when than if,\" Moretti says. \"I never thought this was\ngoing to be a permanent change in the geography of labor.\"\n\nMadison Hoff contributed reporting.\n\nAki Ito is a chief correspondent at Business Insider.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
