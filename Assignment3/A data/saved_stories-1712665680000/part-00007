Earlier that week,\nIsrael had conducted an airstrike on Iran's embassy in Syria, killing two\ngenerals as well as other officers. Retaliation from Iran seemed like a\nplausible occurrence.\n\nSEE ALSO: I\u2019ve been forcibly blue-checked on Elon Musk's X. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s\nlike.\n\nBut, there was one major problem: Iran did not attack Israel. The headline was\nfake.\n\nEven more concerning, the fake headline was apparently generated by X's own\nofficial AI chatbot, Grok, and then promoted by X's trending news product,\nExplore, on the very first day of an updated version of the feature.\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\n## How Musk let this happen\n\nA few years before Elon Musk acquired the platform then-known as Twitter, the\ncompany rolled out a new feature that provided written context for trending\ntopics. The technology powering the written trend descriptions? Humans.\n\nPreviously when a story would break, Twitter's algorithms would catch the\nrelevant keywords being posted and share the trend, but it sometimes wouldn't\nbe obvious why a given set of words was trending.\n\nBut, in 2020, Twitter put together a team of human editors to curate news and\nput trends in context. In addition, the top tweets that showed up under a\ntrending topic would no longer just be algorithmically ranked, but include\nhuman curation as well. One year later, Twitter partnered with AP and Reuters\nto further bolster its efforts to provide human-provided context to trending\ntopics.\n\nShortly after Musk bought the company in October 2022, though, the written\ncontext on trending topics disappeared. Musk had laid off Twitter's human\neditors. As Reuters reported in November 2022, \"Twitter's curation team, which\nwas responsible for 'highlighting and contextualizing the best events and\nstories that unfold on Twitter,' had been axed.\"\n\n## X's newly updated Explore page\n\nEarlier this week, some X fan accounts like @XDaily shared screenshots of X's\nupcoming Explore page relaunch. X's Explore page includes the platform's\ninfamous trending topics list along with specific section breakouts like\n\"News\" and \"Sports\" to provide users with trending stories in each particular\nsubject category.\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\nMusk's updated Explore page looked poised to bring back the written context\nprovided to trending topics and stories.\n\nOn April 4, X began rolling out its newly updated Explore page. The update\nprovides top user posts on each individual trending topic as well as an easy-\nto-digest summary of the subject matter above the user content. At the very\ntop of the page, an X-created headline presents the information to readers\nmuch as if they were about to read an article on the topic.\n\nIn addition, the update also gives Explore a new, prominent location on the\nplatform. Explore's trending stories now appear embedded directly in the\nright-hand sidebar of the main X homepage, where the trending topics list used\nto be located, which hundreds of millions of X's daily users view everyday.\n\nIn a screenshot captured from popular Twitch user Hasan Piker's stream, the\nfake AI-generated X headline can be seen trending on the platform's homepage\nsidebar. Credit: Hasan Piker's Twitch\n\nHowever, Musk has not brought back Twitter's curation team, nor has he hired\nnew human editors to write the context X now provides.\n\nThe context is written by X's AI chatbot, Grok.\n\n## The danger of X depending on AI\n\nWe know that Grok, an AI feature heavily promoted by Musk, powers X's\ncontextualized summaries because X says so itself in the fine print on every\nExplore page.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n  * Elon Musk's X funds lawsuit against Jack Dorsey's Block\n  * Elon Musk's X tests 'adult content' label for X-rated Communities\n  * Elon Musk confirms X accounts with certain subscriber levels will get Premium bonuses\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\n\"Grok is an early feature and can make mistakes,\" reads the tiny note from X\nunderneath the written context provided on the Explore page. \"Verify its\noutputs.\"\n\nMashable observed X's \"Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles\" page which\nspread fake news as it was trending on Thursday.\n\nBased on our observations, it appears that the topic started trending because\nof a sudden uptick of blue checkmark accounts (users who pay a monthly\nsubscription to X for Premium features including the verification badge)\nspamming the same copy-and-paste misinformation about Iran attacking Israel.\nThe curated posts provided by X were full of these verified accounts spreading\nthis fake news alongside an unverified video depicting explosions.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of two separate posts on the X Explore page showing\nfake news posts from blue check users that informed Grok. Credit: Mashable\nscreenshot\n\nFrom there, it appears X's algorithms noticed a potential story trend within\nthese users' posts, and an Explore story page was created. We can deduce from\nX's own claims about its inner workings that Grok must have then created an\nofficial-looking written narrative, along with a catchy headline. It did all\nthis based on select users sharing fake news, in an automated attempt to\nprovide context for what the platform itself seemed to assume was a real\nstory.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time Grok provided users with misinformation.\nPrevious reporting on the early versions of X's chatbot found that it often\ncreated fake news in private chats with the select few users who had access to\nit. However, this recent incident combined with the new Explore feature\npresents the first time X took Grok's misinformation, packaged it as a real\ntrending news story, and promoted it to its entire user base, ostensibly as\ncontext for a real event.\n\nUnder Musk, disinformation has skyrocketed on the platform known as X. Thanks\nto the new Explore product, the company promoted a falsehood, disseminated by\npaying bad actors who stand to make money in exchange for generating\nengagements.\n\nOne day after Grok generated this fake story that X then promoted via its\nExplore page, the company rolled Grok out to all Premium-subscribed X users so\nthey could use the misinformation-creating AI chatbot as well.\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\nTopics Artificial Intelligence Twitter Elon Musk\n\nRecommended For You\n\nXiaomi 14 Ultra review: Does its pro-level camera beat the iPhone?\n\nHey sir, can your camera also make phone calls?\n\n04/05/2024\n\nBy Stan Schroeder\n\nElon Musk's X suspends users who post alleged name of alt-right comic creator\n\n'StoneToss' webcomics frequently feature antisemitism, racism, and anti-LGBTQ\nsentiment.\n\n03/20/2024\n\nBy Matt Binder\n\nElon Musk kills Don Lemon's unaired X show after interview with the former CNN\nhost\n\nMusk has canceled Lemon.\n\n03/13/2024\n\nBy Matt Binder\n\nBest hookup apps and dating sites to find casual sex\n\nFind a casual fling or a spontaneous one-night stand.\n\n04/03/2024\n\nBy Leah Stodart and Tabitha Britt\n\n'Godzilla X Kong' in love?
