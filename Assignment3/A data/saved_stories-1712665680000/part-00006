Lee\n\n  * Add a comment\n  * Share\n\nFacebook Twitter Pocket Reddit Email\n\nWe have long deemed ourselves to be at the pinnacle of cognitive abilities\namong animals. But that is different from being at the pinnacle of evolution\nin a number of very important ways. As Mark Twain pointed out in 1903, to\npresume that evolution has been a long path leading to humans as its crowning\nachievement is just as preposterous as presuming that the whole purpose of\nbuilding the Eiffel Tower was to put that final coat of paint on its tip.\nMoreover, evolution is not synonymous with progress, but simply change over\ntime. And humans aren\u2019t even the youngest, most recently evolved species. For\nexample, more than 500 new species of cichlid fish in Lake Victoria, the\nyoungest of the great African lakes, have appeared since it filled with water\nsome 14,500 years ago.\n\nStill, there is something unique about our brain that makes it cognitively\nable to ponder even its own constitution and the reasons for its own\npresumption that it reigns over all other brains. If we are the ones putting\nother animals under the microscope, and not the other way around,^1 then the\nhuman brain must have something that no other brain has.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

James Balog / Getty Images\n\nSheer mass would be the obvious candidate: If the brain is what generates\nconscious cognition, having more brain should only mean more cognitive\nabilities. But here the elephant in the room is, well, the elephant\u2014a species\nthat is larger-brained than humans, but not equipped with behaviors as complex\nand flexible as ours. Besides, equating larger brain size with greater\ncognitive capabilities presupposes that all brains are made the same way,\nstarting with a similar relationship between brain size and number of neurons.\nBut my colleagues and I already knew that all brains were not made the same.\nPrimates have a clear advantage over other mammals, which lies in an\nevolutionary turn of events that resulted in the economical way in which\nneurons are added to their brain, without the massive increases in average\ncell size seen in other mammals.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWe also knew how many neurons different brains were made of, and so we could\nrephrase \u201cmore brain\u201d and test it. Sheer number of neurons would be the\nobvious candidate, regardless of brain size, because if neurons are what\ngenerates conscious cognition, then having more neurons should mean more\ncognitive capabilities. Indeed, even though cognitive differences among\nspecies were once thought to be qualitative, with a number of cognitive\ncapabilities once believed to be exclusive to humans, it is now recognized\nthat the cognitive differences between humans and other animals are a matter\nof degree. That is, they are quantitative, not qualitative, differences.\n\n> Did the African elephant brain, more than three times as heavy as ours,\n> really have more neurons than our brain?\n\nOur tool use is impressively complex, and we even design tools to make other\ntools\u2014but chimpanzees use twigs as tools to dig for termites, monkeys learn to\nuse rakes to reach for food that is out of sight, and crows not only shape\nwires to use as tools to get food, but also keep them safe for later reuse.\nAlex, the African gray parrot owned by psychologist Irene Pepperberg, learned\nto produce words that symbolize objects, and chimpanzees and gorillas, though\nthey cannot vocalize for anatomical reasons, learn to communicate with sign\nlanguage. Chimpanzees can learn hierarchical sequences: They play games where\nthey must touch squares in the ascending order of the numbers previously\nshown, and they do it as well and as fast as highly trained humans.\nChimpanzees and elephants cooperate to secure food that is distant and can\u2019t\nbe reached by their efforts alone. Chimpanzees, but also other primates,\nappear to infer others\u2019 mental state, a requirement for showing deceitful\nbehavior. Even birds seem to have knowledge of other individuals\u2019 mental\nstate, as magpies will overtly cache food in the presence of onlookers and\nthen retrieve and move it to a secret location as soon as the onlookers are\ngone. Chimpanzees and gorillas, elephants, dolphins, and also magpies appear\nto recognize themselves in the mirror, using it to inspect a visible mark\nplaced on their heads.\n\nThese are fundamental discoveries that attest to the cognitive capacities of\nnonhuman species\u2014but such one-of-a-kind observations do not serve the types of\ncross-species comparisons we need to make if we are to find out what it is\nabout the brain that allows some species to achieve cognitive feats that are\noutside the reach of others. And here we run into another problem, the biggest\none at this point: how to measure cognitive capabilities in a large number of\nspecies and in a way that generates measurements that are comparable across\nall those species.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nA 2014 study tested for self-control, a cognitive ability that relies on the\nprefrontal, associative part of the cerebral cortex, among a number of animal\nspecies\u2014mostly primates, but also small rodents, doglike carnivores, the Asian\nelephant, and a variety of bird species. They found that the best correlate\nwith correct performance in the test of self-control was absolute brain\nvolume\u2014except for the Asian elephant, which, despite being the largest-brained\nin the set, failed miserably at the task. A number of reasons come to mind,\nfrom \u201cIt did not care about the food or the task\u201d to \u201cIt enjoyed annoying its\ncaretakers by not performing.\u201d (I like to think that the reason why it\u2019s so\nhard to train monkeys to do things that are easily learned by humans is their\ndismay at the obviousness of the task: \u201cC\u2019mon, you want me to move to do just\nthat? Gimme something more challenging to do! Gimme videogames!\u201d)\n\nBrainiac: Suzana Herculano-Houzel seeks to learn exactly what it is about the\nhuman brain that allows it to perform much more complex maneuvers than other\nanimal brains seem to. Here, she gives a TED Talk.James Duncan Davidson,\ncourtesy of TED\n\nThe most interesting possibility to me, however, is that the African elephant\nmight not have all the prefrontal neurons in the cerebral cortex that it takes\nto solve self-control decision tasks like the ones in the study. Once we had\nrecognized that primate and rodent brains are made differently, with different\nnumbers of neurons for their size, we had predicted that the African elephant\nbrain might have as few as 3 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 21\nbillion neurons in the cerebellum, compared to our 16 billion and 69 billion,\ndespite its much larger size\u2014if it was built like a rodent brain.\n\nOn the other hand, if it was built like a primate brain, then the African\nelephant brain might have a whopping 62 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex\nand 159 billion neurons in the cerebellum. But elephants are neither rodents\nnor primates, of course; they belong to the superorder Afrotheria, as do a\nnumber of small animals like the elephant shrew and the golden mole we had\nalready studied\u2014and determined that their brains did, in fact, scale very much\nlike rodent brains.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nHere was a very important test, then: Did the African elephant brain, more\nthan three times as heavy as ours, really have more neurons than our brain? If\nit did, then my hypothesis that cognitive powers come with sheer absolute\nnumbers of neurons would be disproved. But if the human brain still had many\nmore neurons than the much larger African elephant brain, then that would\nsupport my hypothesis that the simplest explanation for the remarkable\ncognitive abilities of the human species is the remarkable number of its brain\nneurons, equaled by none other, regardless of the size of the brain. In\nparticular, I expected the number of neurons to be larger in the human than in\nthe African elephant cerebral cortex.\n\nThe logic behind my expectation was the cognitive literature that had long\nhailed the cerebral cortex (or, more precisely, the prefrontal part of the\ncerebral cortex) as the sole seat of higher cognition\u2014abstract reasoning,\ncomplex decision making, and planning for the future. However, nearly all of\nthe cerebral cortex is connected to the cerebellum through loops that tie\ncortical and cerebellar information processing to each other, and more and\nmore studies have been implicating the cerebellum in the cognitive functions\nof the cerebral cortex, with the two structures working in tandem. And,\nbecause these two structures together accounted for the vast majority of all\nneurons in the brain, cognitive capabilities should correlate equally well\nwith the number of neurons in the whole brain, in the cerebral cortex, and in\nthe cerebellum.\n\nWhich is why our findings for the African elephant brain turned out to be\nbetter than expected.\n\nBrain Soup by the Gallon\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe brain hemisphere of an African elephant weighs more than 2.5 kilograms,\nwhich meant that it would obviously have to be cut into hundreds of smaller\npieces for processing and counting since turning brains into soup to determine\nthe number of neurons inside works with chunks of no more than 3 to 5 grams of\ntissue at a time. I wanted the cutting to be systematic, instead of haphazard.\nWe had previously used a deli slicer to turn a human brain hemisphere into one\nsuch full series of thin cuts. The slicer was wonderful for separating\ncortical gyri\u2014but it had one major drawback: Too much of the human brain\nmatter stayed on its circular blade, precluding estimates of the total number\nof cells in the hemisphere. If we wanted to know the total number of neurons\nin the elephant brain hemisphere, we had to cut it by hand, and in thicker\nslices, to minimize eventual losses to the point of making them negligible.\n\n> Why spend $100,000 when a handheld butcher knife would do the job well\n> enough?\n\nAnd so the day started at the hardware store, where my daughter and I (school\nvacation having just started) went looking for L-brackets to serve as solid,\nflat, regular frames for cutting the elephant hemisphere, plus the longest\nknife I could hold in one hand. (Here was an opportunity not to be missed for\na young teenager, who years later could say, \u201cHey, Mom, remember the day we\nsliced up an elephant brain?\u201d) We first sawed off the structural\nreinforcements of the L-brackets then made the elephant brain fit inside.\nSure, there are fancy $100,000 machines that would do the job to perfection,\nbut why spend that much money when a handheld butcher knife would do the job\nwell enough?\n\nI laid the hemisphere flat on the bench top, framed inside the two L-brackets.\nA student held the frames in position while I held the hemisphere down with my\nleft hand and sliced firmly but gently through the brain with the right, in\nback-and-forth movements. Several cuts later, also into the back half as well\nas the cerebellum, and we had a completely sliced elephant brain \u201cloaf\u201d lying\nflat on our benchtop: 16 sections through the cortical hemisphere, eight\nthrough the cerebellum, plus the entire brainstem and the gigantic, 20-gram\nolfactory bulb (10 times the mass of a rat brain) lying separately.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In\nall, we had 381 pieces of tissue, most of which were still several times\nlarger than the 5 grams we could process at one time. It was by far the most\ntissue we had processed. One person working alone and processing one piece of\ntissue per day would need well over one year\u2014nonstop\u2014to finish the job. This\nclearly had to be a team effort, especially if I wanted to have the results in\nno more than six months. But, even with a small army of undergraduates, it was\ntaking too long: two months went by and only one-tenth of the brain hemisphere\nhad been processed. Something had to be done.\n\nCapitalism came to the rescue. I did some math and realized I had some $2,500\nto spare\u2014roughly $1 per gram of tissue to be processed. I gathered the team\nand made them an offer: Anybody could help, and everyone would be rewarded\nfinancially by the same amount. Small partnerships quickly formed, with one\nstudent doing the grinding, the other doing the counting, and both sharing the\nproceeds. It worked wonders. My husband would visit the lab and comment, in\nawe, on the crowd of students at the bench, chatting animatedly while working\naway (until then, they mostly worked in shifts, it being a small lab). Jairo\nPorf\u00edrio took over the large batches of antibody stains, I did all the neuron\ncounts at the microscope\u2014and in just under six months we had the entire\nAfrican elephant brain hemisphere processed, as planned.\n\nAnd the Winner Is ...\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nLo and behold, the African elephant brain had more neurons than the human\nbrain. And not just a few more: a full three times the number of neurons, 257\nbillion to our 86 billion neurons. But\u2014and this was a huge, immense \u201cbut\u201d\u2014a\nwhopping 98 percent of those neurons were located in the cerebellum, at the\nback of the brain. In every other mammal we had examined so far, the\ncerebellum concentrated most of the brain neurons, but never much more than 80\npercent of them. The exceptional distribution of neurons within the elephant\nbrain left a relatively meager 5.6 billion neurons in the whole cerebral\ncortex itself. Despite the size of the African elephant cerebral cortex, the\n5.6 billion neurons in it paled in comparison to the average 16 billion\nneurons concentrated in the much smaller human cerebral cortex.\n\nSo here was our answer. No, the human brain does not have more neurons than\nthe much larger elephant brain\u2014but the human cerebral cortex has nearly three\ntimes as many neurons as the over twice as large cerebral cortex of the\nelephant. Unless we were ready to concede that the elephant, with three times\nmore neurons in its cerebellum (and, therefore, in its brain), must be more\ncognitively capable than we humans, we could rule out the hypothesis that\ntotal number of neurons in the cerebellum was in any way limiting or\nsufficient to determine the cognitive capabilities of a brain.\n\nOnly the cerebral cortex remained, then. Nature had done the experiment that\nwe needed, dissociating numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex from the\nnumber of neurons in the cerebellum. The superior cognitive capabilities of\nthe human brain over the elephant brain can simply\u2014and only\u2014be attributed to\nthe remarkably large number of neurons in its cerebral cortex.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have the measurements of cognitive capabilities required to\ncompare all mammalian species, or at least those for which we have numbers of\ncortical neurons, we can already make a testable prediction based on those\nnumbers. If the absolute number of neurons in the cerebral cortex is the main\nlimitation to the cognitive capabilities of a species, then my predicted\nranking of species by cognitive abilities based on number of neurons in the\ncerebral cortex would look like this:\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nwhich is more intuitively reasonable than the current ranking based on brain\nmass, which places animals such as the giraffe above many primate species,\nlike this:\n\nAs it turns out, there is a simple explanation for how the human brain, and it\nalone, can be at the same time similar to others in its evolutionary\nconstraints, and yet so different to the point of endowing us with the ability\nto ponder our own material and metaphysical origins. First, we are primates,\nand this bestows upon humans the advantage of a large number of neurons packed\ninto a small cerebral cortex. And second, thanks to a technological innovation\nintroduced by our ancestors, we escaped the energetic constraint that limits\nall other animals to the smaller number of cortical neurons that can be\nafforded by a raw diet in the wild.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nSo what do we have that no other animal has? A remarkable number of neurons in\nthe cerebral cortex, the largest around, attainable by no other species, I\nsay. And what do we do that absolutely no other animal does, and which I\nbelieve allowed us to amass that remarkable number of neurons in the first\nplace? We cook our food. The rest\u2014all the technological innovations made\npossible by that outstanding number of neurons in our cerebral cortex, and the\nensuing cultural transmission of those innovations that has kept the spiral\nthat turns capacities into abilities moving upward\u2014is history.\n\nSuzana Herculano-Houzel is a Brazilian neuroscientist.
