While water and\nfood are necessities for all creatures, humans relied on stone tools to hunt\nand butcher animals, as they lack the sharp claws or fangs of other\npredators,\u201d Barkai explains.\n\nBarkai is the senior author of a paper published in the Springer journal\nAchaeologies.\n\nRead More\n\n  * Society\n\n### 50 remarkable and inspirational women in Australian science\n\n\u201cA study of indigenous groups that lived until recently, with some still alive\ntoday, shows that hunter-gatherers attribute great importance to the source of\nthe stone \u2013 the quarry itself \u2013 imbuing it with potency and sanctity, and\nhence also spiritual worship,\u201d Barkai says.\n\n\u201cPeople have been making pilgrimages to such sites for generations upon\ngenerations, leaving offerings at the rock outcrop, while adjacent outcrops,\nequally suitable for stone tool production, remain untouched. We sought to\nunderstand why; what is special about these sites?\u201d\n\nAncient humans have been making stone tools for millions of years. Barkai and\nhis colleagues conducted a study of tool-making sites dating to the\nPalaeolithic (Old Stone Age, 3.3 million\u201312,000 years ago).\n\nThe sites are in the Upper Galilee region in northern Israel and southern\nLebanon. They have large flint reserves for crafting and are within walking\ndistance of major Palaeolithic sites of the Hula Valley \u2013 Gesher Benot Ya\u2019akov\n(790,000 years old) and Ma\u2019ayan Baruch (500,000 years old).\n\nThere are thousands of quarries in the area where, until about 500,000 years\nago, Homo erectus made tools and left offerings. But flint was present in\nother locations untouched by these ancient people.\n\nBarkai\u2019s decided to cross-reference the migration routes of elephants \u2013 a\nstaple in the diet of prehistoric humans \u2013 with the location of flint quarries\nand found a correlation.\n\nIllustration of elephant hunting using spears.
