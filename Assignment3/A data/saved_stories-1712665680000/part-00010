His parents filed for\nbankruptcy when he was just five years old and divorced shortly thereafter. In\nthe years that followed, Adam\u2019s life was a bit turbulent. He would bounce\naround between different schools and different condominiums where he lived\nwith his mother, sister, and whoever his mother was dating at the time. Though\nhis living situation at home wasn\u2019t unbearable, there wasn\u2019t much money to go\naround. His lowest point was living in a cockroach-infested condo where he\nwould regularly steal napkins from fast food restaurants to save money for his\nfamily.\n\nEventually, Adam moved out of that cockroach-infested condo and into a real\nhouse when he was in middle school. And though this was a step up for Adam\u2019s\nliving situation, it was a step down for his schooling situation. The high\nschool Adam would eventually attend was in the top 100 for most dropouts in\nthe state. Nevertheless, Adam studied hard, got good grades, and got into a\ngreat college.\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to my friend Benjamin. Benjamin grew up with a\nnice middle class lifestyle. Though his parents also divorced when he was\nyoung, Benjamin\u2019s father and extended family were heavily involved in his\nlife. In fact, his mother and father got along so well that they would\nsometimes attend each others\u2019 family functions alongside Benjamin. As a result\nof this, Benjamin had a great childhood with lots of love and emotional\nsupport.\n\nAnd while Benjamin\u2019s family didn\u2019t have a ton of money, there were moments of\nfinancial prosperity. For example, when Benjamin was in high school he lived\nin a three story house, had a big screen TV, and his parents owned a sports\ncar. This nice lifestyle provided immense stability for Benjamin to do well in\nschool. As a result, he graduated valedictorian of his high school class and\ngot into a great college.\n\nHere we have two stories about two people with two seemingly different\nupbringings. But what if I told you that, despite their differences, Adam and\nBenjamin went to the same university, got similar jobs after college, and have\nhad roughly similar lifetime earnings? What would you say to that? How would\nthat make you feel? Are Adam and Benjamin equally deserving of their success?\nOr does background matter when taking into account one\u2019s achievements?\n\nYou probably already have your answers to these questions. But, I have a\nconfession to make\u2014Adam and Benjamin aren\u2019t two of my friends. They aren\u2019t\neven two different people. They are both me.\n\nYes, every detail about Adam and Benjamin\u2019s lives come from my life. I just\nselectively chose what to tell you about each of them. For Adam, I emphasized\nthe struggles I had growing up, but with Benjamin I emphasized the immense\nprivileges I had that most others don\u2019t. Neither story is more true, they are\nboth biased in their own way.\n\nBut think about how often this happens without you knowing about it. How many\nstories do we hear from people who overemphasize their struggles and downplay\ntheir privileges to shape their image?\n\nFor example, there is a part in the David and Victoria Beckham documentary,\nwhere Victoria talks about how she grew up \u201cworking class.\u201d That\u2019s when David\nbarges in and says \u201cBe honest...What car did your Dad drive you to school in?\u201d\nTo which Victoria begrudgingly replies, \u201cIn the 1980s my dad had a Rolls\nRoyce.\u201d\n\nMany people want to downplay what advantages they had growing up to make\nthemselves seem more deserving of their current lifestyle. They are always\ntrying to seem less privileged then they really are (or were). For example\nwhen you ask people, \u201cTo which social class do you belong?\u201d only 1%-2% will\never answer \u201cupper class\u201d even though the upper class includes the top 5% of\nthe wealth spectrum.\n\nPeople will also downplay their advantages when they are trying to sell you\nsomething, especially in the financial space. Just think about how many\nfinancial influencers tell their \u201crags\u201d to riches story as evidence of how to\nget rich, only to sell you on how to get rich as well. Unfortunately, often\nthe only thing being sold is their story.\n\nAfter all, wouldn\u2019t you rather listen to the person who was \u201cbroke\u201d and then\ngot rich over the person who was already rich and then came up with a system\nto get rich? It seems logical that the broke-to-rich person\u2019s advice is\nprobably better than the rich-to-rich person\u2019s advice. But how would you know?\nYou wouldn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that every person who went from nothing to something is lying.\nOf course not, but I am saying that many of them are probably overemphasizing\ntheir struggles to help their cause. Why? Because it makes a better story.\nBecause it sells better.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think that someone\u2019s current financial standing or background\nshould hold much weight when determining whether their advice is useful. Just\nbecause someone is rich doesn\u2019t imply that they know how they got rich. The\nsame goes for someone who was \u201cpoor\u201d and then became rich. After all, you\ncould\u2019ve gotten rich in a different way than what you claim publicly.\n\nWhat we should do instead is judge the advice based on its own merits. Could\nthis advice have worked for other people? Does it have any evidence of doing\nso? This is what ultimately matters, not how broke/rich its creator was.\n\nUnfortunately, I know this line of logic won\u2019t sway most people. Because most\npeople do care about someone\u2019s financial background and story before they will\nlisten to them. It\u2019s only natural to want proof of work. But, before you go\nall-in on someone else\u2019s advice, make sure you know why.\n\nBecause it may not be their advice that is selling you, but their story.
