I will again give you some\nexcerpts, full pdf as usual down below.\n\n> Hi, I was actually on the fence of how to respond to this! Other members of\n> the code of conduct team wanted to make sure that you understood that we\n> were being quite serious and were open to discussion\n\nby giving a 6-sentence reply you are not communicating that.\n\n> However, it was brought to our attention apparently you have decided to take\n> to posting about this to your blog.\n\nI have full rights to do so, just like you apparently had the right to post it\nto your mailing list.\n\n> You even dug through my mastodon to find an old post I made?\n\n\"Old\" is quite the statement - the post I reference is Feb 25th, 3 weeks\nbefore your original e-mail. What is old, is your intel, being 1.5 if not over\n2 years old.\n\nNo \"digging\" was necessary - it's a public account. Just like you \"dug\nthrough\" my blog and discord server.\n\n> Anyway, this is beyond unacceptable. I will be disabling your account on\n> Freedesktop after wrting this email. You will be removed from any other FDO\n> spaces as well\n\nWhat is unacceptable is your power trip.\n\n> only one person in this situation has posted libel regarding the other in a\n> public space, specifically you on your blog, and if I am harassed as a\n> result of that libel I will be contacting you with a real lawyer.\n\nFeel free. If posting your own methods of harassment to see by the public is\nlibel, sure. Last time I checked, libel has to actually be unjustly\nunfavorable. I post your own words.\n\n### Final (probably) conclusion\n\nAs we can see, X.org/Freedesktop/RedHat utilizes people who are power-hungry,\nhypocritical and self-obsessed as moderators to say the least. Moderators that\ndo not wish to look at themselves in a mirror, and treat any and all\ndisagreement as a personal attack.\n\nOn one hand, they dig through others' 2-year-old messages on a discord server,\nbut on the other are shocked when someone posts a screenshot of their 3-weeks-\nold post on mastodon.\n\nThey do not accept any discussion, Lyude themselves suggesting that they were\nNOT willing to indulge in any, despite the content of this email:\n\nDear Lyude, before calling this old, please look at the date posted.\n\nBest part is, this post was made shortly before Lyude's 3-weeks-later reply.\n\n### Results\n\nAs of now, I have been banned from the Freedesktop Gitlab instance and related\nIRC channels.\n\nFor Hyprland Development, Hyprland and Hypr*, this doesn't mean much. We are\nstill allowed to use any and all software under the Freedesktop umbrella as\nper their FOSS licenses. What is a shame is that I cannot contribute any\npatches/issues to wlroots, which, well, at least in my opinion, were positive\nadditions. But that's just my opinion, it seems.\n\nFor freedesktop, this means that it's no longer truly appropriate to call it\nfree, as it absolutely is not. The banhammer is wielded by people who\nseemingly only wield it to silence people whom they disagree with.\n\n## Closer\n\nIt's a shame to see such an important pillar of the modern Linux desktop,\nFreedesktop, in such a state.\n\nI truly hope it can improve with time, regardless of whether I am a part of it\nor not. I really do hope so. Not because of me, but because of all the past\nand possibly future instances of similar behavior.\n\nIf anyone here is marring the reputation of Freedesktop, unfortunately, in my\nopinion, it's you, Lyude.\n\nThank you, dear reader, from the bottom of my heart, for reading this thread,\nregardless of whether you agree with me or not. I am now going to go listen to\nBeast In Black.\n\n## Resources\n\nLyude's reply to this post pdf\n\nQuestions, comments, mistakes? Ping me a mail at vaxry [at] vaxry.net and I'll\nget back to ya.\n\nMade with literal caveman technology by vaxry, 2024.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
