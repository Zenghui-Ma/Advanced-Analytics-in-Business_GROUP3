after\ndriving 18-wheeler onstage\n\nPublished Wed, Apr 17 20248:30 AM EDTUpdated 2 Min Ago\n\nJordan Novet@jordannovet\n\nAnnie Palmer@in/annierpalmer/\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Less than eight years after introducing the Snowmobile at its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas, Amazon has taken the 18-wheeler out of service.\n  * Amazon Web Services designed the semi to help customers move large amounts of data to the cloud.\n  * A page on the AWS website devoted to products for large-scale data migration no longer mentions the Snowmobile.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * AMZN\n\nAmazon Web Services Snowmobile Truck\n\nCNBC\n\nAt Amazon's annual cloud conference in 2016, the company captured the crowd's\nattention by driving an 18-wheeler onstage. Andy Jassy, now Amazon's CEO,\ncalled it the Snowmobile, and said the company would be using the truck to\nhelp customers speedily transfer data to Amazon Web Services facilities.\n\nLess than eight years later, the semi is out of commission.\n\nAs of March, AWS had removed Snowmobile from its website, and the Amazon unit\nhas stopped offering the service, CNBC has confirmed. The webpage devoted to\nAWS' \"Snow family\" of products now directs users to its other data transport\nservices, including the Snowball Edge, a 50-pound suitcase-sized device that\ncan be equipped with fast solid-state drives, and the smaller Snowcone.\n\nAn AWS spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company has\nintroduced more cost-effective options for moving data. Clients had to deal\nwith power, cooling, networking, parking and security when they used the\nSnowmobile service, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Since we introduced Snowmobile in 2016, we've released many other new\nservices and features which have made migrating data to AWS even faster and\neasier for our customers,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nAn AWS Snowmobile truck appears in a Seattle parking lot in 2019.\n\nAndrew Evers | CNBC\n\nSnowmobile was priced at $0.005 gigabytes per month, not including other\ncosts, according to a page formerly on the AWS website. For a company with 100\npetabytes of data \u2014 the capacity of a Snowmobile \u2014 a transfer job would cost\nabout $500,000 per month.\n\nAmazon's decision to axe Snowmobile comes as Jassy implements cost cuts across\nthe company to contend with lackluster sales growth. Amazon has slashed more\nthan 27,000 jobs since late 2022 and has discontinued projects in the devices\nand retail units. The cuts have continued this year, with Amazon laying off\nhundreds of jobs in AWS earlier this month.\n\nWhile it's fairly routine for AWS and rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud\nPlatform to get rid of products and services, the elimination of Snowmobile\nstands out due to the splashy way it was introduced at the company's showcase\nReinvent conference in Las Vegas in late 2016.\n\nJassy, who at the time led AWS, was delivering his keynote before tens of\nthousands of people in the crowd, when the 18-wheeler joined him on stage.\n\n\"We're going to need a bigger box,\" Jassy said, as audience members rushed to\nraise their smartphones to capture photos of the spectacle.\n\nJassy told the crowd why the truck was groundbreaking. Over a 10 gigabit-per-\nsecond connection, it would take 26 years to move an exabyte, or 1 million\nterabytes, of data to the cloud, he said. An AWS customer could do the job\nwith 10 Snowmobiles in under six months, he said. Each Snowmobile had a\ncapacity of 100 petabytes on hard disk drives.\n\nIn a blog post coinciding with the launch on Nov. 30, 2016, Amazon cloud\nevangelist Jeff Barr described Snowmobile as \"a ruggedized, tamper-resistant\nshipping container 45 feet long, 9.6 feet high, and 8 feet wide\" that \"can be\nparked in a covered or uncovered area adjacent to your existing data center.\"\n\nBarr helped to convey the supposed simplicity of the process with photos of a\nSnowmobile built out of Lego getting connected to a corporate data center.\n\n\"We intend to make sure that Snowmobile is both faster and less expensive than\nusing a network-based data transfer model,\" Barr wrote.\n\nBut the product didn't take off.\n\nA spokesperson for satellite operator Maxar said the company used Snowmobile\nonce in 2017 to move more than 100 petabytes to AWS from its own servers.\nSnowmobile was an \"ideal solution for that moment in time,\" the spokesperson\nsaid.\n\n\"Since then, we have been uploading our imagery and associated data directly\nto the cloud,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAWS still leads the giant cloud infrastructure market and generated $90.8\nbillion in revenue last year, accounting for 16% of Amazon's total sales. The\ncompany's spokesperson said AWS' Snowball Edge devices, which clients can\nreturn to Amazon by mail after filling them up with data, are smaller than the\nSnowmobile vehicles, cost less and have a shorter turnaround time.\n\nThere's also the AWS DataSync service for moving data, announced in 2018.\nClients generally find that sending data to AWS online is more economical than\nusing Snowmobile, the company said.\n\n\"We couldn't be more proud of the value that Snowmobile has brought to\ncustomers, and we're pleased to see them choosing newer, more efficient\ntechnologies,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Wednesday's analyst calls: Tesla price target cuts, GE spinoff to pop more than 20%\n  * If you're worried about a correction and over-invested in Nvidia, replace it with these steady growth stocks instead\n  * It may be time for investors to sell Nvidia on the next bounce, according to the charts\n  * Wall Street is bullish on copper, thanks to AI.
