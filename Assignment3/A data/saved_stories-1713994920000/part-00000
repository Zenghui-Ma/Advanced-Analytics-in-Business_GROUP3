Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.). (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nListen\n\n8 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nKey federal lawmakers Sunday unveiled a sweeping proposal that would for the\nfirst time give consumers broad rights to control how tech companies like\nGoogle, Meta and TikTok use their personal data, a major breakthrough in the\ndecades-long fight to adopt national online privacy protections.\n\nThe bipartisan agreement, struck by Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria\nCantwell (D-Wash.) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy\nMcMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), marks a milestone in the congressional debate over\ndata privacy. The issue has befuddled lawmakers despite near-universal\nagreement \u2014 in Silicon Valley and in Washington \u2014 on the need for federal\nstandards to determine how much information companies can collect from\nconsumers online.\n\nThe measure, a copy of which was reviewed by The Washington Post, would set a\nnational baseline for how a broad swath of companies can collect, use and\ntransfer data on the internet. Dubbed the American Privacy Rights Act, it also\nwould give users the right to opt out of certain data practices, including\ntargeted advertising. And it would require companies to gather only as much\ninformation as they need to offer specific products to consumers, while giving\npeople the ability to access and delete their data and transport it between\ndigital services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSignificantly, the deal \u2014 one of Washington\u2019s most significant efforts to\ncatch up to privacy protections adopted in Europe nearly a decade ago \u2014 would\nresolve two issues that have bogged down negotiations for years: whether a\nfederal law should override related state laws and whether consumers should be\npermitted to sue companies that violate the rules.\n\nThe bill would achieve a Republican goal by preempting more than a dozen\n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d state privacy laws that have sprung up amid congressional\ninaction \u2014 including a watershed California measure \u2014 while allowing state\nrules on more-targeted issues like health or financial data to stand.\nMeanwhile, it would allow an enforcement method championed by Democrats: civil\nlawsuits that would let individuals seek financial damages if companies fail\nto fulfill data deletion requests or to obtain express consent before\ncollecting sensitive data.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a bright line here where we\u2019re catching bad actors and\npolicing the information age,\u201d Cantwell told The Post in an interview Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn an interview Sunday with the Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Wash., McMorris\nRodgers called it \u201ca historic piece of legislation\u201d that would \u201cestablish\nprivacy protections that are stronger than any state law on the books.\u201d\n\nThe Post and other news outlets reported Friday on the expected deal, but\ndetails of the proposal did not become public until Sunday. As the committees\nreleased two versions of the draft legislation, key lawmakers and industry\nleaders praised the proposal, even as some floated potential changes.\n\nFollow Technology\n\nRep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), the top Democrat on McMorris Rodgers\u2019\ncommittee, called it a \u201cvery strong discussion draft\u201d but said there are \u201ckey\nareas\u201d where it could be \u201cstrengthened,\u201d including children\u2019s privacy.\nMicrosoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith, whose company hails from\nWashington state, called it a \u201cgood deal\u201d that would \u201cprovide clarity by\nestablishing a national standard\u201d on privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nEven with the support of Cantwell and McMorris Rodgers, whose committees bear\nprimary responsibility for privacy legislation, the measure faces uncertain\nprospects, however. It is a \u201cdiscussion draft,\u201d meaning the two committee\nchairs are likely to solicit input from other lawmakers and outside groups\nbefore formally introducing it.\n\nAnd the window for passing any legislation \u2014 much less a complex online\nprivacy bill \u2014 is fast closing before the November elections. With McMorris\nRodgers set to step down from Congress in January, the need for action becomes\neven more urgent. But, Cantwell said: \u201cA deadline is a good thing.\u201d\n\nOver the past half-decade, Congress has held dozens of hearings on data\nprivacy as political scrutiny of technology companies\u2019 alleged privacy abuses\nintensified, with lawmakers unveiling a flurry of proposals aimed at tackling\nthose concerns. But no sweeping privacy legislation has been adopted by either\nchamber of Congress, and few measures have even gained significant traction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDuring the previous Congress, House lawmakers including McMorris Rodgers\nadvanced a sprawling privacy bill aimed at breaking the impasse. But key\nleaders \u2014 including Cantwell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)\n\u2014 spoke out against it.\n\nAt the time, Cantwell said the House measure would impose a multiyear delay on\nwhen consumers can bring their own lawsuits, criticizing that provision as one\nof the bill\u2019s \u201cmajor enforcement holes.\u201d She also expressed concern that\ncompanies could weaken the law by forcing users into arbitration, a process\nthat can require parties to resolve privacy disputes without going to court.\n\nAfter the House bill stalled, privacy talks ramped back up in December,\nCantwell said, when McMorris Rodgers approached her about reviving\nnegotiations directly between the two of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe new legislation mirrors the House proposal in several ways: It would force\ncompanies to minimize and disclose their collection practices and let users\ncorrect or delete their own data. It also would bar companies from using the\ndata they collect to discriminate against protected classes. And it would\nrequire them to appoint executive officers responsible for ensuring compliance\nwith the law.\n\nBut the compromise measure also contains key differences: For example, it\nwould not impose a delay on when individuals can file lawsuits and it would\nbar most arbitration agreements from interfering with the intent of the\nlegislation \u2014 changes sought by Cantwell, who called it \u201cnight and day\u201d\ncompared to the House version.\n\nA senior aide on the Senate Commerce Committee, who spoke on the condition of\nanonymity to preview the legislation, said Cantwell and McMorris Rodgers made\nit a priority to hash out those issues, along with Republican concerns about\nthe ability of small businesses to comply with the measure\u2019s provisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTo that end, the proposal would exempt companies with less than $40 million in\nannual gross revenue from its requirements and would place heightened\nobligations \u2014 including a requirement to conduct regular privacy reviews \u2014 on\n\u201clarger data holders\u201d with more than $250 million in annual gross revenue.\n\nThe measure would not accomplish some other priorities. For example, it would\nnot prohibit companies from targeting minors with ads, as President Biden\ncalled for during his State of the Union addresses. Nor would it create a\n\u201cyouth privacy and marketing division\u201d at the Federal Trade Commission, as the\nprevious House legislation proposed.\n\nWhile the proposal is meant to offer \u201ccomprehensive\u201d privacy protections, the\nsenior Commerce Committee aide said it is seen as \u201ccomplementary\u201d to other\nbills on child safety and privacy that are expected to be taken up in the\nSenate. That includes a measure by Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) that would\nexpand federal children\u2019s privacy laws and another led by Sens. Richard\nBlumenthal (D-Conn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) that would create new\nchild safety obligations for digital platforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe measure would \u201cterminate\u201d the FTC\u2019s efforts to craft new regulations on\nprivacy, though the agency \u2014 along with state attorneys general \u2014 would be\nresponsible for enforcing the measure. It also would largely strip the Federal\nCommunications Commission of any privacy oversight in the telecommunications\nsector, bringing those matters under the purview of the FTC \u2014 a wrinkle that\nhas in the past troubled consumer advocates.\n\nThe privacy compromise is part of a recent surge of activity on new internet\npolicies. In February, Blumenthal and Blackburn announced that they had\nsecured enough support for online child safety legislation to clear the\nSenate, teeing up a potential vote this year. In March, the House passed\nlegislation to force TikTok to be sold by its Chinese parent or be banned in\nthe United States, kicking the issue over to the Senate. A week later, the\nHouse passed a more narrow privacy bill aimed at stopping data brokers from\nselling U.S. user information to \u201cforeign adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing to be a very busy few months,\u201d Cantwell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nShe said lawmakers will try to attach the child privacy and safety bills to an\nupcoming must-pass legislative package, and that her committee plans to take\nup the House data broker bill. As for the broader privacy bill, Cantwell said\nshe plans to contact other lawmakers \u201cin earnest\u201d Monday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how significant the bill\u2019s support could be on\nCapitol Hill. Nor was it clear whether state leaders whose laws would be\npreempted by the measure would rally against it \u2014 something that muddled talks\nover privacy on Capitol Hill in the past.\n\n\u201cI do think people think a comprehensive policy is better as long as it can\nreach a strong, beefy standard,\u201d Cantwell said, \u201cwhich I think this does.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nGoogle fires more workers after CEO says workplace isn\u2019t for politics\n\nDating apps are collecting more of your information than you think\n\nTesla profit slumps on price cuts but unveils plans for affordable models\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": true}
