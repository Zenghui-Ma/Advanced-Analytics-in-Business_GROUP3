It\u2019s supposed to spurn investments and\ncapital growth. The issue is it\u2019s just another form of printing money that\nartificially inflates assets since these banks turn around and invest that\nmoney into the stock market (or whoever they lend it to does).\n\nA shocking chart came across my screen just now that shows that when you\ndivide the S&P 500 vs the Fed\u2019s balance sheet (which is to say how much money\nthe Fed has printed), the correlation is almost exact and the value of the\nmarket is also flat.\n\nThanks for reading Innovation Nation!

Asset\nprices are simply inflated due to an overabundance of capital to be invested.\nPerhaps the worst part is this only has benefit the holders of stocks, which a\nlarge majority of are banks and wealthy individuals. None of this money has\ngotten to Main Street.\n\nI cannot understate how horrifying a realization this is as capitalism\nrequires constant growth to survive. This in essence says all the growth since\n2008 was fake. Wow.\n\nThanks for reading Innovation Nation!
