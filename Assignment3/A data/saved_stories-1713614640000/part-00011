This also includes the\nperipherals, such as the Z84C10 range of MPUs. These are currently already\nmarked as EoL on stores like Mouser, with Littelfuse noting that the last\norders with them can be placed until June 14th of 2024. After that you\u2019ll have\nto try your luck with shady EBay sellers and a lucky box of old-new-stock\nfound in the back of a warehouse.\n\nWhat this effectively means is that after just under 48 years since its launch\nin 1976, the Zilog Z80 will no longer be available for sale as discrete\ncomponents, which is likely to primarily impact hobbyists and people who are\ntrying to keep retro systems going. This does not mean that it\u2019s the end of\nthe road for Z80, however, as the eZ80 will be produced for the foreseeable\nfuture.\n\nThese new chips will of course not come in easy to drop in DIPs, making the\nchallenge of breadboarding your own Z80-based microcomputer that much tougher.\nYet one thing that definitely won\u2019t happen is any of us witnessing the end of\nthe era of the Z80, 6502 and 8051 architectures.\n\nThanks to [Techokami] for the tip.\n\nPosted in News, Parts, RetrocomputingTagged z80, Zilog Z80\n\n## 17 thoughts on \u201cEnd-Of-Life For Z80 CPU And Peripherals Announced\u201d\n\n  1.

Will they\ncome for my vacuum tubes too? Wait! What?!\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  2. Bob says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 4:44 pm\n\nMaybe NTE Electronics will start making it. Thay\u2019re currently making the 6502\nand 6809.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Garth Wilson says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 7:14 pm\n\nDoes NTE actually make any ICs or other semiconductors, or do they just buy\nand re-label them? AFAIK, the only source of 6502\u2019s (actually 65C02, as the\nNMOS 6502 ended 20+ years ago) is Western Design Center, plus WDC\u2019s licensees\nthat are putting 65C02\u2019s at the heart of custom ICs, ie, ASICs, for\nautomotive, appliance, toy, and even life-support applications).\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  3. ziggurat29 says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 4:48 pm\n\nall things come to an end, alas. the 555, however, will outlive us all.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Weird that never happened.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  4.
