This was just a bug! A\nproblem with QA! It absolutely, positively wasn't a reflection of corrupted\nculture at Google, which now appeared to put ideology over accuracy. Really,\nreally!\n\nAnyone watching that shit show would be right to wonder whether one of\nAmerica's great technology companies had fallen completely into the hands of\nthe new theocracy. I certainly did.\n\nBut now comes evidence that Google perhaps isn't totally lost, even if an\ninternal war over its origin principles is very much raging. One pitting the\nmission of organizing the world's information and making it useful against the\nnewspeak Trust & Safety goal of controlling narratives and countering\nmalinformation (i.e. inconvenient truths).\n\nThis played out in stereotype as 28 Googlers occupied the CEO of Google\nCloud's office for 10 hours this week, defaced property, and prevented other\nGooglers from doing their work. Because Google provides cloud services to\nIsrael, said the occupiers. And thus The Current Thing demanded it be stopped\nby whatever means possible. (Remember when The Current Thing was that GitHub\nshouldn't offer its technology to ICE because \"kids in cages\"? Same thing).\n\nBut then the most amazing thing happened. There was no drawn-out\ninvestigation. No saccharine statements about employee's rights to occupy\noffices, preventing work from happening, or advance their political agenda at\nwork. Nope. They were just fired. Immediately. All 28 of them.\n\nBravo.\n\nGoogle's bottom line? \"This is a place of business\". And while employees have\nthe lawful right to protest their working conditions, they do not have the\nright to prevent a business from carrying out its normal course of commerce\nover a disagreement in politics. So that was that.\n\nBut it gets better. Google followed up the unceremonious firings by calling an\nend to employees bringing their politics to the office. Just like Coinbase\ndid, just like we did. The language was spot on:\n\n> \"But ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are\n> clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts\n> coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a\n> personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.\n> This is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted.\"\n\nThree years ago, taking a common-sense position like this would have been met\nwith drama and outage in the media and on Twitter. Today I doubt it'll bring\nmore than a ripple outside of a few activist echo chambers on Mastodon.\nAmazing progress!\n\nNote, none of this pertains to what you think about The Current Thing that\nprovided the trigger this time. It could just as well had been BLM,\nRussiagate, climate change, or a million other hot-button topics that have\noccupied the role as The Current Thing, and been used to justify these kinds\nof insufferable activists yelling at their boss.\n\nWe've not just passed the peak of the nonsense that nearly swallowed corporate\nAmerica whole, but we're now seeing them repudiate it head on. If Google, with\nit's employment roster still packed with people sympathetic to the new\ntheocracy, can put its foot down, so can the rest of the Fortune 500 and\nbeyond. It's time they all say: \"This is a place of business\".\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
