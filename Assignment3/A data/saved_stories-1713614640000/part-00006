That\u2019s because a federal court this month granted\nthe government a one-year extension to continue intelligence collection.\n\nSection 702 requires the government to seek approval from the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court for the categories of intelligence it wants to\ncollect. The court has issued \u201ccertifications\u201d for collection involving\ninternational terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and foreign governments\nand related entities. Those certifications are good for one year and were\nrenewed this month at the government\u2019s request.\n\nU.S. officials have long argued that the law is a vital means of collecting\nthe electronic communications on foreign government adversaries and terrorist\ngroups. But its renewal has become an unusually divisive flash point, aligning\nconservative Republicans and liberal Democrats who are wary of granting the\ngovernment broad surveillance authorities without new restrictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe people familiar with the efforts to keep the companies in compliance\ndeclined to name them, but they said their loss would deal a significant blow\nto U.S. intelligence collection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super concerning,\u201d said one U.S. official of the potential loss of\nintelligence. \u201cYou can\u2019t just flip a switch and turn it back on again.\u201d\n\nFollow Technology\n\nU.S. officials began to hear Friday afternoon that the providers were planning\nto stop compliance unless Section 702 was reauthorized.\n\nSenators are attempting to come to an eleventh-hour agreement on amendments on\nthe legislation Friday night to quickly reauthorize the measure and avoid any\nlapse. Last week, the House renewed Section 702, but only for two years \u2014 and\nonly after privacy hawks failed to pass an amendment that would have required\nU.S. intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant to review Americans\u2019\ncommunications collected under the program. That bid failed in a dramatic\n212-212 tie vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe House approval came despite former president Donald Trump\u2019s entreaty on\nsocial media to \u201cKILL\u201d the bill, in part due to the spurious charge that the\nfederal surveillance power had been used to spy on his 2016 campaign.\n\nFirst passed in 2008 and reauthorized several times since then, the law\nenables the NSA to collect without a warrant from U.S. tech companies and\ncommunications providers the online traffic of non-Americans located overseas\nfor foreign intelligence purposes. Communications to or from foreign targets\ndeemed relevant to FBI national security investigations \u2014 about 3 percent of\nthe targets, according to the government \u2014 are shared with the bureau. But the\nlaw is controversial because some of those communications may involve\nexchanges with Americans, which the FBI may view without a warrant.\n\n\u201cThe House bill represents the biggest expansion of surveillance in 15 years\nsince Section 702 was originally created, and a shameful Congress would be\nexpanding surveillance at a time when reforms are needed,\u201d said Jake\nLaperruque, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s\nSecurity and Surveillance Project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nU.S. security officials, for their part, for years have extolled the benefits\nof the law, with White House officials saying that the intelligence collected\naccounts for more than 60 percent of the president\u2019s daily briefing. FBI\nDirector Christopher A. Wray recently disclosed that it helped the bureau\ndiscover that Chinese hackers had breached the network of a U.S.\ntransportation hub, and that it had helped thwart a terrorist plot last year\nin the United States involving a potential attack on a critical infrastructure\nsite.\n\n\u201cFailure to reauthorize 702 \u2014 or gutting it with some kind of new warrant\nrequirement \u2014 would be dangerous and put American lives at risk,\u201d Wray told\nCongress this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nOpinions from our Editorial Board\n\nViews from The Post\u2019s Editorial Board on current events\n\nOpinion|The Supreme Court\u2019s hardest case yet in Donald Trump\u2019s legal saga\n\nOpinion|The Post endorses Angela Alsobrooks in Maryland\u2019s Democratic Senate\nprimary\n\nOpinion|South Africa\u2019s ANC is headed for a reckoning at the ballot box.
