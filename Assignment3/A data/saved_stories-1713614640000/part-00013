In January,\ndisappointed True Detective: Night Country fans spotted and called out a\nclearly AI-generated poster in the background of an episode. Last month, indie\nhorror film Late Night With The Devil endured a similar blowback after using\ncomputer-generated images during a few transitions in the film. (The creators\nlater specified that they did \u201cexperiment\u201d with AI to create the images, but\npersonally edited them after the fact.) Even Pink Floyd made headlines when\nthey selected an AI-generated video as one of the winners for their Dark Side\nOf The Moon anniversary contest earlier this month.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nFor a mere $3 billion, you could've bought indie darling A24\n\nElizabeth Banks finds the prospect of bias in AI scripts \"terrifying\"\n\nNetflix plans to make you freeloaders finally cough up the dough\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nNetflix plans to make you freeloaders finally cough up the dough\n\nUnfortunately, despite outraged fans\u2019 and creators\u2019 attempts at boycotts and\nother direct action, it looks like Reese Witherspoon was right when she said\nthat AI was here to stay, so we should all \u201cjust get used to it.\u201d Case in\npoint: two separate, major studios have made headlines for their unwelcome use\nof the technology in just the past 48 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nFor a mere $3 billion, you could've bought indie darling A24\n\nElizabeth Banks finds the prospect of bias in AI scripts \"terrifying\"\n\nNetflix plans to make you freeloaders finally cough up the dough\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nNetflix plans to make you freeloaders finally cough up the dough\n\nThe first of these studios is A24, which lost a great deal of goodwill amongst\nits normally fervent fanbase yesterday when it published a series of\napparently AI-generated posters for Alex Garland\u2019s Civil War. While all of the\nposters depict war-torn visions of recognizable American cities and\nlandmarks\u2014none of which actually appear in the film\u2014perhaps the most egregious\nis a version of Chicago where the Marina City towers simply aren\u2019t in the\nright place. (Did Wilco teach us nothing?) If you zoom in on the tan building\non the left side of the poster, you can also see some tell-tale signs of AI\nblurring and incorrect doubling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther easy-to-spot mistakes include a wreckage-filled Miami street where one\ncar seems to have three doors, and some abomination that\u2019s either a swan boat\nwith no seat, or the largest swan to ever live. It\u2019s also especially ironic\nthat this is happening to a film by Alex Garland, whose excellent 2015 movie\nEx Machina posits AI as an invention equivalent to the atomic bomb in its\ncapacity (and inevitability) to render humanity obsolete. (Domhnall Gleeson\nactually quotes Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201cI am become death\u201d speech in the film.) A24 did\nnot immediately respond to The A.V. Club\u2019s request for comment on this piece,\nbut it\u2019s pretty safe to assume this was a marketing decision made by higher-\nups without consultation from Garland himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s not just A24. A recent Futurism article pointed out that Netflix also\nused the technology to commit an objectively worse sin. In the true crime\ndocumentary What Jennifer Did, which follows a young woman named Jennifer\nPan\u2019s alleged plot to kill her parents, a number of pictures depicting Pan as\na \u201cbubbly, happy, confident, and very genuine\u201d person before her arrest appear\nto have been artificially generated, or at least manipulated. The photos\n(depicted in more detail in the linked article) also have the tell-tale signs;\nPan\u2019s hands and ears aren\u2019t quite right, objects in the background are muddled\nnonsense, and in one image\u2014actually used on the documentary\u2019s poster\u2014she has\none impossibly long tooth. The fact that AI was used was not disclosed\nanywhere in the film\u2019s credits. (Netflix did not immediately respond to The\nA.V. Club\u2019s request for comment on this story.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the presence of AI in movie posters is frustrating (and perhaps a suable\nexample of false advertising), its use in a documentary is downright\nterrifying. As 404 Media reported, filmmakers and Archival Producers Alliance\nco-founders Jennifer Petrucelli, Stephanie Jenkins, and Rachel Antell actually\npresented draft guidelines for the ethical use of AI in documentary work just\nthis week. While their suggestions revolve more around practicing complete\ntransparency than curtailing the use of AI altogether (it isn\u2019t going away any\ntime soon, after all), the filmmakers\u2019 main fears rest in the fact that\nartificial photos and video deepfakes could imminently lead to a warped\narchive not even historians will be able to trust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve realized is once a piece of media exists, even if it\nis disclosed [that it\u2019s AI generated], it can then be lifted out of any\ndocumentary, make its way onto the internet and into other films, and then\nit\u2019s forever part of the historic record,\u201d Antell said (via 404). \u201cArchival\nmoves at a human pace and GenAI does not move at a human pace, and so for\nhumans to keep up with it, that\u2019s a very unlikely thing to be able to happen.\u201d\nIncreasingly, it seems the race may already be lost.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
