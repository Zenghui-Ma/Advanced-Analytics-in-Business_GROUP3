That has of course not stopped keen inventors\nfrom trying either more or less, and here you see some of the results.\n\nThis page confines itself to the unconventional. Goods vehicles with six or\nmore wheels are of course very common. Tracks are not counted as wheels; this\nmatters because there are various vehicles with a mixture of wheels and\ntracks.\n\nONE WHEEL\n\nI don't think there is any rational way you could call a vehicle with one\nwheel a car. The Museum has an extensive collection of monowheels, but very\nfew of them have any form of bodywork and the majority can only carry one\nperson. A possible candidate might be the monowheel tank (preferably as the\ncivilian version).\n\nLeft: A civilian version of the monowheel tank: 1933\n\nThis design's claim to be a one-wheeled car is somewhat undermined by the two\nhefty stabiliser wheels at the back. It appears however that these can be\nraised by a lever once you've got up speed. Other objections are that the\nsteering is by handlebars rather than a steering-wheel, and that it seems to\nbe strictly a one-seater.\n\nAnyhow, that's the best I can do for the moment, but I suspect that a trawl\nthrough the covers of Popular Science and similiar journals would soon throw\nup something that could claim more plausibly to be a one-wheeled car.\n\nThis is an artist's impression and it is extremely unlikely that it was ever\nbuilt.\n\nLeft: The Killen-Strait tractor: date unknown\n\nI hope we can all agree that this a one-wheeled vehicle, and it is certainly\nnot a monowheel. There may be an excellent agricultural reason for this\nconfiguration, but I have no idea what it is. Can anyone help?\n\nI am also unsure of the advantage of steering with the little track; it does\nnot appear to be powered.\n\nGoogling \"Killen-Strait tractor\" gets you a lot on the Killen-Strait Armoured\nTractor, built in Britain in 1915, which is often considered to be the first\narmoured tracked vehicle, rather than this one-wheel farming tractor. The\nKillen-Strait Armoured Tractor was all-track (including a little one at the\nfront for steering, again) and it has a Wikipedia page.\n\nLeft: The Killen-Strait tractor: date unknown\n\nThis is taken from a photograph, and is clearly the source of the drawing\nabove. I have so far found no other images or info on what is a most\ninteresting machine.\n\nThis picture shows a helpful direction arrow on the top of the steerable\ntrack. This presumably means that the front track was not visible from the\ndriving position. Steering was by worm and pinion, and so multi-turn; that may\nhave had something to do with it. Research suggests it was a guide to the\ndriver keeping the front track in its furrow.\n\nI wonder if it had that one wheel to save money? Tracks are complicated and\nexpensive to make.\n\nNow, the nwheel vehicle game (Mornington Crescent!) depends on what rules you\ndecide to follow. If you don't count tracks as wheels, then:\n\nLeft: Holt Midget-18 Model-K tractor: 1915\n\nIgnoring the tracks, this is clearly a one-wheel vehicle. This means of\nsteering (one wonders how effective it was) was adopted to avoid the\ndifficulties of steering with just the tracks, which as any tank designer can\ntell you, involves complicated clutches and differentials.\n\nNote the red directional pointer above the front wheel.\n\nLeft: The Yuba Ball Tread 12-20 tractor: date unknown\n\nLike the Holt Midget-18 above, this tractor had twin tracks riding on two rows\nof large steel balls, instead of pins and rollers. The water-cooled engine ran\non petrol (or somewhat heavier 'distillate') and had magneto ignition with\nNewton Automatic spark advance. '12-20' meant a 20 HP engine with 12 HP\navailable at the drawbar.\n\nYou can read the instruction manual here. It gives no clue what 'Ball Tread'\nrefers to, but it seems to mean just the use of ball bearings in the tracks,\nwhich is emphasised in the manual. Manufacture of the Yuba ceased in 1921, and\nby 1931 production of ball-tread tractors ceased completely.\n\nThe Ball Tread Co. began building tracked tractors in Detroit in 1912. The\ntractor shown here is believed to have been the company\ufffds first product. The\ncompany also produced an 18-35 model. In 1914, the Yuba Construction Co. of\nMarysville, California bought out the Ball Tread company and relocated\noperations to California.\n\nLeft: The Beltrail Model-B 12-20 tractor: date unknown\n\nThis machine had the very unusual set-up of just one track running underneath\nthe vehicle. At first sight looks as if it might be another case of just one\nwheel plus tracks, like the Killen-Strait tractor above, but there could very\nwell be another wheel behind the engine. I am suspicious and am searching for\nother photographs.\n\nLeft: The Bean Trackpull tractor: date unknown\n\nThe Bean Trackpull also had a single central track. You can see the advantage;\nif you can make it work you've immediately eliminated dozens of track parts.\nThere are two steering-wheels; the top on does the actual steering by\nswivelling the rear wheel assembly (how effective was that?) The lower wheel\napparently operated the clutch. The engine was rated at 6 to 10 HP. According\nto their adverts, Bean claimed this machine was the equivalent of six horses.\n\nOn the basis of we-don't-count-tracks-here this is a two-wheeled vehicle, but\nI want to keep it next to the central-tracked Beltrail Model-B.\n\nThere is more info here.\n\nLeft: The Bean Trackpull tractor: 1918\n\nThe Trackpull was aimed at orchards and vineyards; it could move between trees\nplanted closely together. The picture shows how the rear wheels could be set\nat 90 degrees to the track, so the machine could turn around in its own\nlength.\n\nLeft: The Bean Trackpull tractor: 1918\n\n2 WHEELS\n\nIf we permit ourselves the luxury of two wheels for a car, then we find\nourselves with a good number of genuine candidates.\n\nTwo-wheeled cars with gyroscopes are dealt with here and here.\n\nTwo-wheeled cars without gyroscopes are dealt with on the 2-wheeled car page.\nThese cars all have one wheel at the front and one at the back.\n\nIf you have two wheels side-by-side then you have a diwheel.\n\nLeft: The Bryant diwheel: 1938\n\nThe Museum has a large collection of diwheels, but this artist's impression is\nthe nearest it gets to an actual car. This design (which I am quite sure no\none attempted to build) certainly has bodywork and clearly seats at least two\npeople; probably more judging by the windows halfway along the cabin. Note the\nrudder at the back for high-speed steering. You can read more this vehicle on\nthis page.\n\nIt is far from clear how you would change a wheel should you suffer a\npuncture. This design has not been tested for practicality.\n\n### 3 WHEELS\n\nThere have been a huge number of three-wheeled cars. Here only a few\nespecially significant or odd designs are displayed.\n\n3 WHEELS: A C SOCIABLE: 1911\n\nLeft: The A C Sociable: 1907-14\n\nThe A C Sociable was a very successful early three-wheeler. It adopted what is\nusually considered to be the most stable configuration- two wheels in front\nand one at the back, like the Morgan. Driver and passenger sat side-by-side,\nmaking conversation easier, and so this was called the 'sociable'\nconfiguration. The original name was Auto Carriers Ltd.\n\nIt had a 5.5 HP 631 cc air-cooled side-valve single-cylinder engine, and a\ntwo-speed epicyclic gearbox, with no reverse gear; final drive was by chain to\nthe rear wheel. The front axle was solid with semi-elliptic leaf springs,\nwhile the single rear wheel had dual quarter-elliptic leaf springs. Brakes\noperated on the transmission and the rear wheel. The wheelbase was 70 inches.\n\nThis model has a luggage-box on the rear body.\n\nLeft: The A C Sociable: 1907-14\n\nAn A C Sociable from the other side.\n\nThe A C Sociable has an entry on the A C Wikipedia page.\n\nLeft: The A C Sociable: 1907-14\n\nEconomical motoring. Date of picture unknown.\n\nLeft: The A C Sociable: 1907-14\n\nWith the hood up. Location and date of picture unknown. This AC Sociable dates\nfrom 1912.\n\nLeft: The A C Sociable: 1907-14\n\nLocation and date of picture unknown.\n\nLeft: Unidentified French tricycle: 19??\n\nThis French tricycle is vaguely reminiscent of a tractor, with its headlight\npeering out from between protective bars.\n\nThe machine remains unidentified. An image search has yielded nothing. Can\nanyone help?\n\nPhotographed at the annual Griffith Park Sidecar Rally, year unknown.\n\nLeft: Unidentified French tricycle: 19??\n\nThis looks like a lot of vehicle to carry just one person.\n\nLeft: Unidentified French tricycle: 19??\n\nGERMAN PHANOMOBIL THREE-WHEELER: 1910\n\nLeft: Phanomobil three-wheeler: circa 1910?\n\nThis beautiful image was sent to me by one of my correspondents. Three\nJapanese ladies sit in a remarkable three-wheeled vehicle, now identified as a\nGerman Phanomobil. A few thousand of these vehicles were produced between 1907\nand 1927. There is an excellent site describing the reconstruction of a\nPhanomobil here.\n\nThe engine is mounted over the front wheel and drives it by a chain. Clearly\nthe whole thing is swivelled by the tiller, which must have been hard work.\nGiven the distance between the tiller and the pivot the turning circle must\nhave been rather large. The cylinder on top of the tiller looks as if it is a\ntelescopic sight for accurately aiming the vehicle, but it is actually a\nlubricating oil tank.\n\nThere appear to be two exhaust pipes leading to a cylindrical silencer under\nthe headlight, and on top there are two tall pillars that appear to have\nsprings around them; they are probably automatic inlet valves. This suggested\na two-cylinder in-line engine, and it is now confirmed that it was a 1290 cc\ntwin in-line unit.\n\nThere are two pipes to the right of the engine that look as if they are for\nwater-cooling, but the engine barrel is finned for air-cooling. There is a rod\non the left side of the engine that looks as if it connects to a magneto (on\nits side) and probably controlled the ignition advance/retard.\n\nThere is more information here and here.\n\nLeft: Phanomobil van: 1912\n\nPhanomobils were produced in many forms, including fire engines and carrier-\npigeon transports. This delivery van is at the Louwman Museum at The Hague in\nHolland.\n\nThere are considerable differences in the engine installation; note the two\nfans, more shrouding of the drive-chain, and a sideways-firing exhaust that\nmust have annoyed people, not least because the exhaust from the cylinders\nappears to go straight into it without any form of silencer. There are two\nspark plugs per cylinder, driven by the magneto sitting just above the exhaust\npipe.\n\nAlso, the two tall pillars (inlet valves?) visible on the picture above and\nbelow seem to be missing.\n\nLeft: A Phanomobil fire engine: date unknown\n\nLeft: A 1912 Phanomobil in a New Zealand museum\n\nLike the Phanomobil van above, there are two cooling fans.\n\n3 WHEELS: CYKLON AND CYKLONETTE: 1899-1924\n\nLeft: Cyklon tricycle: 1899\n\nThis early machine was the forerunner of the Cyklonette described below. It\nwas designed by Franz Louis H\ufffdttel; (1862-??) he went on to design both the\nCyklonette and the Ph\ufffdnomobil. (also below) The front wheel is driven by a\nleather-covered rope; this can be slackened by a lever on the right side of\nthe handle bars to act as a clutch. Somehow leather-covered rope doesn't sound\nas if it would be free from slipping.\n\nThe 4-stroke engine has an automatic inlet valve. The carburettor is of the\nsurface type; the induction stroke pulls air out of the top of the fuel tank,\nthrough an elegantly curved pipe leading to a brass drum with 2 handles;\npresumably a throttle, and a mixture control which admitted extra air. Surface\ncarburettors relied on simple evaporation, rather than atomising nozzles, and\nwere not very effective; they were essentially extinct by 1904. Ignition is\npowered by a battery in the box below the seat and behind the fuel tank.\nAnother curved pipe leads down to the top of the engine cylinder, the\nautomatic inlet valve being inside it. There is pedal drive to the rear wheels\nby a block chain.\n\nThere are some biographical details of Franz H\ufffdttel here.\n\nLeft: Cyklon Cyklonette 3-wheeler from Berlin, out in the country: 1930\n\nUntil now this machine was billed as a Phanomobil. It looks very similiar to\nthe machine in Japan. (above) It has a chain drive on the left side of the\nfront wheel, just like the Phanomobil. I suggest it would have fooled anybody.\n\nHowever, I am informed it is actually a Cyklon Cyklonette, made from 1904 to\n1924. This is a still from the film Die Drei von der Tankstelle (1930) meaning\n\"The Three from the Gas-Station\". There is a brief Wikipedia page.\n\nOf the film: \"The gas station attendant Heinz R\ufffdhmann from the gas station\nKuckuck dedicates himself to a three-wheeled cyclonette. This economical\nvehicle was built in Berlin between 1904 and 1924\".\n\nMany thanks to Nils Moh for pointing out the error and providing the\ninformation.\n\nLeft: Cyklon Cyklonette preserved: 1930\n\nThe location is unknown.\n\nLeft: Cyklon Cyklonette 3-wheeler: 1930\n\nThis is another still from the film, presumably set at the Gas-Station of the\nfilm title.\n\nLeft: Cyklon Cyklonette 3-wheeler: 1930\n\nThis still gives a better picture of the Cyklonette.\n\nJACKSON 3-WHEELER: 1910\n\nLeft: Jackson three-wheeler: 1910\n\nThis car has now been identified by Paul Dunlop as a three-wheeler made by\nRobert Reynold Jackson & Co Ltd in Notting Hill, London. Fifty of these cars\nwere ordered for use in Costa Rica, where the unmade roads were so deeply\nrutted it was impossible to steer a car as the front wheels could not swivel.\nThe idea was that the front wheel would travel on the ground between the two\nruts and so be able to steer. It has not yet been confirmed that the cars were\nsuccessfully delivered.\n\nThe vehicle was considered unusual enough to attract some attention in British\nand German periodicals in 1910. Normally Jackson made conventional four-wheel\ncars, often with parts imported from De Dion in France.\n\nThe signboard in the background carries the address '26 High St, Notting Hill\nGate', presumably close to the location of the Jackson factory.\n\nThe Jackson Company has a page in Graces Guide.\n\nMr Jackson also has a bio page in Graces Guide.\n\nLeft: Jackson three-wheeler: 1910\n\nAnother view at the same location.\n\nSource: Unidentified magazine\n\n3 WHEELS: THE TSAR TANK: 1915\n\nLeft: The Tsar tank: 1915\n\nThe Tsar tank was probably the biggest three-wheeler ever built. It was\nprototyped by Imperial Russia, but proved wholly impractical.\n\nThis image (I am not sure if it is a model or a rendering) gives a much\nclearer view of the Tsar-tank's construction than the few photographs that\nexist. There was a circular turret on top of the main body; it appears to have\nfour guns at 90-degree spacing, so presumably did not traverse. The turret is\ntoo small to hold a decent-sized gun, and the field of fire is restricted as\nthe turret is below the top of the front wheels. There is also a turret with\nat least one gun underneath the main body, with an even more restricted field\nof fire, and two further guns mounted in sponsons on each side.\n\nThe rear wheel, or roller, looks as if it may be divided in three, so\ntechnically you could call it a five-wheel vehicle. I think it's clear\nhowever, that this is basically a three-wheeler.\n\nThere is more on the Tsar tank on the unusual tanks page.\n\n3 WHEELS: HARPER RUNABOUT: 1921\n\nThe Harper Runabout was developed by Robert O Harper, and manufactured by Avro\nproduced from 1921 to 1926. (Around this time Avro were experimenting with\ntwo-wheeled cars)\n\nThe Harper Runabout has a Wikipedia page but it has little information.\n\nLeft: The Harper runabout: 1921-24\n\nThe engine was a single-cylinder two-stroke Villiers of 269cc, which developed\n2.5 HP, and drove the rear wheels by chain, via a three-speed gearbox.\nStarting was accomplished by a pull-up lever on the left hand side of the\ndriver, which could be operated from a sitting position. This lever also\nfunctioned as a ratchet hand brake.\n\nScience Museum collection.\n\nLeft: The Harper runabout: 1921-24 There were quarter-elliptical springs on\nall three wheels, which were of pressed steel. Remarkably for the time, there\nwere disc brakes on all three wheels. It was capable of an economical 100 mpg\nrunning at 40 mph.\n\nA common complaint was that the Harper looked a bit too much like a bath\nchair. (a contemporary invalid carriage)\n\nA total of about 500 machines were produced. This example from 1921 is in the\nScience Museum collection.\n\nLeft: Advert for The Harper runabout\n\nThe 'Brief Specification' gives some more technical details of the Harper.\nNote the acetylene lighting with an intriguing 'shaking grid generator'. I\nwould like to know more about that... but Google is silent on the subject.\n\nAnd it is NOT a camouflaged motorcycle! Definitely not!\n\nLeft: The Harper runabout\n\nThis seems to be some sort of entry in a trade catalogue rather than an\nimpartial article.\n\nThe 'emergency extra seat', which somehow does not sound too alluring, allowed\na passenger to sit behind the driver, facing backwards.\n\n3 WHEELS: THE SCOTT SOCIABLE: 1921-25\n\nThe Scott Sociable was a very odd sort of three-wheeled car manufactured from\n1921 to 1925 by the Scott Autocar Company of Bradford, Yorkshire. This was an\noffshoot of the well-known and respected Scott Motorcycle Company.\n\nIn the course of World War I Alfred Scott developed sidecar machine gun\ncarriers. They were not very successful. After the war he tried a similiar\nconfiguration for civilian transport. There emerged a highly asymmetrical\nthree-wheel car with two wheels in line, with a third wheel out to the side\nand slightly behind the other rear wheel. (Overcoming the puncture drawback\nnoted just above), though that was not the reason)The configuration resembled\nthat of a motorcycle and sidecar combination, but looked very wrong. It looked\njust like a car with a wheel missing, and apparently handled like one. It was\noriginally announced in 1916 as the Sociable, but production was postponed\nuntil 1921. About 200 were made before production stopped in 1924. The cost of\na complete Sociable was \ufffd273 in 1921, falling to \ufffd135 by 1924.\n\nDriver and passenger sat side-by-side; and this was called the 'sociable'\nconfiguration.\n\nLeft: The Scott Sociable: 1921-25\n\nThis picture demonstrates all too clearly that the Scott Sociable just looked\nwrong, as if it was poised on the point of falling on its nose.\n\nThe Sociable had a triangulated tubular steel frame, and a proper steering\nwheel acting by rack and pinion on the front wheel. It was powered the Scott\nCompany's own water-cooled 578 cc twin-cylinder two-stroke engine driving\nthrough a three-speed gearbox to the offside rear wheel only, by shaft; there\nwas no differential, and no reverse gear. It has been recorded that turning\nwas dangerous at speed; I'll bet it was.\n\nThere are many, many, three-wheeled vehicles in the world. This may be the\noddest.\n\nLeft: The Scott Sociable: 1922\n\nThis Scott clearly dates from 1922.\n\nAccording to Timothy Jacobs, author of Lemons- The World's Worst Cars, \"It had\nsome of the characteristics of a motorcycle-and-sidecar arrangement, but\nwithout the flexibility, and could be extraordinarily treacherous to drive.\" I\nbelieve it.\n\n3 WHEELS: THE GOLIATH PIONIER\n\nLeft: The Goliath Pionier: 1931-34\n\nThe very neat Goliath Pionier was manufactured by Goliath Werke Borgward & Co.\nGmbH. in response to the poor economic conditions in Germany at the time. It\ncould be driven without a licence and was exempt from car tax. It was superior\nto its competitors and was successful until an improving German economy made\nit less desirable. A total of 4000 were made.\n\nIt was powered by a single-cylinder two-stroke engine of 198 cc (5.5 HP\nclaimed at 3200 rpm) or 247 cc. (7 HP claimed) The gearbox had three forward\nspeeds\n\nIt has a good Wikipedia page.\n\nLeft: The Goliath F400 freight three-wheeler: 1933-35\n\nThe Goliath F400 was a freight version of the Pionier. It was powered by an\nair-cooled two-cylinder two-stroke engine giving 12 to 13.6 hp from a 396 cc\ndisplacement.\n\nIt has a Wikipedia page.\n\n3 WHEELS IN LINE SLINGER MOTORCYCLE: 1901\n\nLeft: Three wheels in line Slinger motorcycle: 1901\n\nThis unique motorcycle is powered by a 499cc De Dion engine. The radiator is\nthe round thing with the vertical pipes. The actual cylinder is on the other\nside of it. The first stage of the drive is a chain, and the second stage is\nanother chain on the hidden side of the machine. It has a surface carburettor\nand coil ignition. It has no clutch and no gearbox, which must have\ncompromised the performance. Apparently it could reach 35 mph in 1901.\n\nThe exact meaning of 'compensated steering' is opaque, but there is a link\nfrom the front fork of the bicycle to the front fork of the mini-motorbike\nassembly. Note that the mini-motorbike swivels freely with respect to the\nbicycle, and is directed by steering the front wheel.\n\nThe machine was built in 1901, by W. (Billy) Slinger, an electrical engineer\nfrom Settle, Yorkshire. It took six years to build; and no others were\nconstructed. Just what Mr Slinger was aiming at is unclear. The man in this\npicture is J P Smith, who owned the machine in 1949.\n\nThere is more info here here.\n\nLeft: Three wheels in line Slinger motorcycle: 1901\n\nJ P Smith of Keighley sets off on his Slinger 1901 at the start of the 22nd\nPioneer Run of the Sunbeam Motorcycle Club. According to my calculations this\nwas in 1958 or 1962, but I am ready to be corrected.\n\nLeft: Three wheels in line Slinger motorcycle: 1901. Location & date unknown\n\nAmazingly the machine still exists. You can even see a video of J P Smith\nriding it taken during the 1955 Banbury Run, on YouTube. It appears the whole\nmini-bike at the front swivels as a rigid unit, but it is hard to be sure.\nYouTube gives the date of construction as 1903.\n\nThe grey box contains the petrol tank in its upper section, as shown by the\nlocation of the petrol pipe. It is not known what was in the lower section;\nwater for the cooling system, perhaps?\n\nLeft: Three wheels in line Slinger motorcycle: 1901\n\nPretty good proof that it still runs!\n\nLeft: Three wheels in line Slinger motorcycle: 1901\n\nThis is the Slinger at the Finish Line of the London to Brighton Veteran Car\nRun in 2019. It is now owned by Mr Daniel Ward, who is presumably pictured\nhere. Since he is unlikely to have pushed this awkward machine very far, I\nthink we can assume it completed the Run under its own power.\n\nIt is not on the list of entrants for the 2022 Run.\n\n3 WHEELS: PEUGEOT TRIPORTEUR\n\nLeft: Peugeot Triporteur: 1953\n\nThe Peugeot Triporteur was essentially a three-wheeled single-cylinder\nmotorbike for carrying small loads. This is an original example that has been\nfaithfully restored; it dates from early 1953.\n\nThe earlier 53TM 100 cc model could carry 120 kg in the crate at the front;\nthe later 55TN 125cc model could carry 150 kg. Maximum speed was 45 km/hr.\nProduction was from 1939 to 1959.\n\nLeft: Peugeot Triporteur: 1953\n\nThe engines were 2-stroke with flywheel magneto ignition. Lubrication was by\npetroil mixture. There was a 3-speed gearbox by operated by a lever on the\npetrol tank. Primary and secondary transmissions was by chains.\n\nLeft: Peugeot Triporteur: 1953\n\nThis example appears to have a duct for air-cooling around the cylinder.\n\nLeft: Peugeot Triporteur: 1939\n\nContemporary advert for the Peugeot Triporteur.\n\n3 WHEELS: BROUGH SUPERIOR MOTORCYCLE WITH DOUBLE REAR WHEELS\n\nLeft: Brough Superior motorcycle with double rear wheels: 1932\n\nThe Brough Superior Austin Four was a limited-production motorcycle designed\nand manufactured by Brough Superior of Nottingham, Britain; it was built from\n1932 to 1934. Only ten were built, of which nine survive. Unusually, it was\npowered by a proven Austin 4-cylinder sidevalve, water-cooled motor of 747cc.\nBrough increased the Austin engine displacement to 797 cc and replaced the\ncylinder head with a light alloy version which gave more horsepower,\npresumably by increasing the compression ratio. The rear wheels were shaft\ndriven from a standard Austin 7 three-speed gearbox, (plus reverse) with a\ncrown wheel and pinion mounted between the two rear wheels. You might think\nthat twin rear wheels would make the handling tricky, but the Museum Staff\nhave not so far found any evidence for this.\n\nThe twin rear wheels make it a three-wheeled vehicle, though legally it was\nstill classed as a motorcycle because the rear wheel centres were less than 24\ninches apart. The machine was primarily intended for sidecar work, which would\npresumably yield a four-wheel vehicle.\n\nThe Brough Superior Austin Four has a Wikipedia page.\n\n3 WHEELS: MODIFIED M4 SHERMAN TANK: 1944\n\nLeft: M4 Sherman tank modified for mine-clearing: 1944\n\nThis is an M4 T10 mine clearing prototype built by the USA in 1944, based on a\nM4 Sherman tank. The original intention was to install engines in the two\nfront wheels, but initial testing was done without them. It weighed 52 tons,\nand the front wheels were 8 feet in diameter, while the rear roller was 6 feet\nin diameter. It's nickname was indeed 'tricycle'.\n\nI'm prepared to call this a three-wheeler because the 'rear wheel' appears to\nbe a single roller running the width of the vehicle. The big open-tread front\nwheels were designed to set off landmines, like the mine flail vehicles of\nWW2.\n\nThere are a good number of imaginary vehicle pictures that have been created\nby Photoshop, and you have to be careful. This looks like it could one of\nthem, but research confirms it is genuine.\n\nLeft: M4 Sherman tank modified for mine-clearing: 1944\n\nThe front wheels were driven by the tank sprocket-wheels engaging with\ninternal teeth on the inside of the wheel; these can just be seen on the wheel\nat the extreme left. The star-shaped teeth on a shafts engaging with the metal\ntread were for clearing the wheels of debris, incuding explosive debris. There\nis another such shaft for the rear roller. I originally said they were for\npropulsion; many thanks to Bill Todd for pointing out this infelicity.\n\nThe prototype was reconfigured to use the tank's internal engine, and the\nunderside was reinforced with 25mm steel plate. The M4A2 had 55 inches of\nground clearance. The total width of the cleared path was 153 inches. (the\nfront wheels had a width of 36.5 inches each) The tank could only reach 3 km/h\nwhen mine clearing, but on the road it could make 10 km/h. In June 1944 the\nT10 was tested, but it became clear that it was just too heavy to be\npractical.\n\nThe idea never got past this single prototype.\n\n3 WHEELS: RELIANT ROBIN: 2018\n\nThree-wheeled cars are not considered very unusual in Great Britain at least,\nthough they are now becoming rare. Historically, three-wheeler production was\nencouraged by lower road tax than four-wheel cars, and because they could be\nlegally driven with a motorcycle licence. (The latter legal situation changed\nrecently)\n\nThe major 3-wheeler manufacturers in Great Britain were Reliant and Bond.\nUltimately Reliant bought out Bond, and it was Reliant that produced the\nfamous Bond Bug.\n\nLeft: A Reliant Robin: 2018\n\nThe Reliant Robin was first produced in October 1973 to direct replace the\nReliant Regal\n\nThe Reliant Robin had a water-cooled engine (originally only 750cc) under the\nhatch at the front, driving the back axle via a conventional propshaft and\ndifferential. The last Robin came off the production lines in 2002, the last\nbatch of 65 having leather seats, alloy wheels, and walnut dashboards. Now\nthat is class.\n\nThis Reliant lives a couple of steets away from me, and there is (or was)\nanother living only half a mile away. I see one driving around occasionally,\nbut have not so far been alert enough to spot which it is.\n\nThe crash-worthiness of a fibreglass-bodied car is not great. As was\ndemonstrated when a friend of mine was killed in a Robin.\n\nAuthor's photograph: Jan 2018\n\n3 WHEELS: MORGAN\n\nThe Morgan company began selling three-wheelers with one wheel at the rear and\na V-twin engine at the front in 1911, and continued until 1952. The company\nannounced that production of a version using a Harley-Davidson V-twin would be\nrestarted in 2012, but the production models actually used an S&S engine.\n\nLeft: The Morgan three-wheeler: 2012\n\nThis is a three-wheeler of a rather different stamp. It is powered by a big\nV-twin engine at the front (yes, I suppose that is obvious) that drives the\nrear wheel.\n\nThere is a Wikipedia page on Morgan.\n\nA perhaps non-obvious drawback of three-wheelers is that since you are making\nthree tracks on the road, the chances of encountering a randomly-placed nail\nare increased by 50%.\n\n3 WHEELS: LOMAX 223\n\nLeft: The Lomax three-wheeler: 1982\n\nThe Lomax three-wheeler is a British kit car in the same configuration as the\nMorgan, with two wheels at the front and one at the back. It has a fibreglass\nbody mounted on a Citro\ufffdn 2CV or Citro\ufffdn Dyane floorpan. In later versions a\nsteel tube chassis was introduced to replace the floorplan. The first Lomax\n223's were powered by a Citroen 2CV 602cc engine, which is a horizontally-\nopposed air-cooled twin.\n\nThe Lomax is still in limited production at Cradley Motor Works, but\nproduction seems to be winding down.\n\nThe Lomax has a Wikipedia page.\n\n### 4 WHEELS:\n\n4 WHEELS: THE SUNBEAM-MABLEY: 1901\n\nAs noted at the start, there is pretty near universal agreement that the best\nnumber of wheels for a car is four. There's not much point in looking at\nordinary cars here, but you can have four wheels and be unconventional about\nwhere you put them. A classic example is the Sunbeam-Mabley:\n\nLeft: The Sunbeam-Mabley: 1901\n\nThis car was the first produced by the famous Sunbeam company. They bought in\na design from a certain Maxwell Mabley-Smith, whose day job was designing\nornamental ironwork. There is variation in the spelling, with Mabberley and\nMaberley both about on the Web. Mabley is the correct version.\n\nThe Sunbeam had one wheel at the front, one at each side, and one at the rear;\nthis is often described as a diamond configuration, but in fact the front and\nback wheels were not in line. The layout was similiar to that of Starley's\nCoventry Rotary quadracycle. The car was powered by a single-cylinder 2.75 HP\nDe Dion engine mounted next to the front wheel, but it did not drive this\nwheel at all. A belt from the engine ran backwards to a 2-speed gearbox and\ndifferential; chain drives ran from this to the two unsprung side wheels.\n\nThe seating was as unorthodox as the wheel placement. Two people sat close\ntogether on the front seat, facing the side of the road; the driver sat behind\nthem, steering with a tiller and facing the opposite side of the road. This\nall sounds very unnatural; the natural tendency would be to twist round to\nlook in the direction in which you are going. This is especially a good idea\nif you are the driver. Note that extra seat backs have been added at the\ncorners of this version to make the twisting a bit less uncomfortable.\n\nA small-diameter exhaust pipe goes round in an elegant semi-circle, then heads\ntoward the rear. In the previous update I said 'Note the red-lined petrol tank\nmounted on the far side of the car' but it now appears it is a radiator header\ntank. Looking at the fins on the cylinder I assumed that the engine was air-\ncooled, but closer investigation shows that the cylinder head only is water-\ncooled and there is a four-row gilled-tube radiator mounted just above the\nengine. The petrol tank was somehow fitted in between the driver and the\npasssengers; for the time being the exact location remains enigmatic, but it\nmust be reasonably high up for gravity feed to the carburettor.\n\nLeft: The Sunbeam-Mabley: 1901\n\nThis is another Sunbeam-Mabley; the engine here appears to be wholly water-\ncooled. This machine was sold by auction at Sotheby's on 23rd October 1969.\n\nThe auctioneer's blurb states that the engine is partly air-cooled and partly\nwater-cooled, but this does not square with the appearance of the engine,\nwhich looks to be wholly water-jacketed.\n\nThe blurb states that the engine power was 2.75 HP, from a 74mm bore and 76mm\nstroke; the capacity was 327cc and the inlet valve was automatic. It also\nstates that ignition was by trembler coil, but that looks like a magneto on\nthe front to me. Its price when new was stated as \ufffd130.\n\nThe Museum staff have so far not been able to find out what it sold for in\n1969.\n\nLeft: The Sunbeam-Mabley: 1901\n\nThis is a contemporary picture of the Sunbeam-Mabley. No extra seat backs\nhere.\n\nThe engine here seems to have a water-cooled head and a finned cylinder barrel\nfor air cooling. No radiator header tank is visible, and the radiator has six\nrows instead of four. No magneto is visible; I suspect the writer of the\nauctioneer's blurb mentioned above was working from this picture.\n\nRemarkably the Sunbeam-Mabley had some success; several hundred were sold in\n1901 and 1902 at \ufffd130 each. It was still in the Sunbeam catalogue in early\n1904, offering a single cylinder 327 cc engine 74 x 76 mm to run at 1,800 rpm.\nWeight 4\ufffd cwt. (which is very light) The price then was \ufffd120.\n\nLeft: Sunbeam-Mabley AR39: 1901\n\nThis Sunbeam-Mabley was sold at auction for \ufffd65,000 in November 2011, which\npresents a good advance on the initial purchase price of \ufffd130.\n\nThe cylindrical silencer can be seen just ahead of the centre wheel.\n\nAR39 has successfully taken part in the London-Brighton veteran car run.\n\nLeft: Sunbeam-Mabley AR39: 1901\n\nIt was this photograph that made it clear that the engine was partly water-\ncooled and partly air-cooled. It also shows that the tank at the front is a\nwater header tank and not the petrol tank.\n\nOn the top of the cylinder head, in a copper housing is an automatic inlet\nvalve; it opened against a light spring on the induction stroke. Simple but\nnot conducive to good engine breathing. A black right-angle induction manifold\nconnects it to the carburettor; immediately to the right is the polished\ncopper float-chamber.\n\nLeft: Sunbeam-Mabley AR39: 1901\n\nHere the wide pulley on the engine crankshaft can be seen; the belt is not\nfitted.\n\nJust to the left of the cylinder barrel can be seen two control rods;\npresumably they work the throttle and choke on the carburettor.\n\nLeft: A Sunbeam-Mabley at the Sunbeam works\n\nThe engine arrangements look rather different here, but the photograph is not\nclear enough to make out any details.\n\nThe date is unknown but must have been in the period 1901 - 1904.\n\n4 WHEELS: THE VICKERS-WOLSELEY STAFF CAR: 1926\n\nLeft: Vickers-Wolseley Staff Car: 1926\n\nThis is another attempt to combine the advantages of wheels and tracks. It was\na conversion- a rather radical conversion- of a Wolseley touring car. Here the\nwheels are raised so the vehicle travels on its tracks.\n\nSource: Miltary Transport of WW1 by C Ellis and D Bishop, Blandford Press\n1970.\n\nLeft: Vickers-Wolseley Staff Car: 1926\n\nHere the wheels are lowered for road use. The track system is rigidly attached\nto the car body. The design was not a success, proving complicated and\nexpensive; there were doubts about its stability. The idea was tried again in\n1927 on what might be regarded as an armoured car, but that also was not\nproceeded with.\n\nSource: Miltary Transport of WW1 by C Ellis and D Bishop, Blandford Press\n1970.\n\n4 WHEELS: SIDEWAYS PARKING IN 1927\n\nLeft: Sideways parking: 1927\n\nYou can see a video here of a car with the front wheels set at right angles to\nthe usual direction of motion. When the front of the car has been swung out\nsideways, the front wheels swivel outwards to the normal configuration.\n\nThe car is believed to be a Citro\ufffdn B12 Torpedo, and the location Paris.\nHowever there is another video that gives the location as Arras in France.\n\nThis sort of thing has never caught on, presumably because the extra weight\nand complication was too great compared with the limited number of times it\nwould have been useful.\n\nSource: Pathe newsreel issued 2nd May 1927. More info here.\n\nLeft: Sideways parking: 1927\n\nThere is no sign of any extra mechanism around the stub axles; this suggests\nthe wheel-swivelling was done by altering the effective length of the track-\nrod. (tie-rod) There is also no sign of front-wheel drive, which suggests that\nthe car was swivelled by causing the rear wheels to turn in opposite\ndirections, requiring an extra gearbox.\n\nA related concept is the zero-turn lawnmower, which can turn around on the\nspot. Some of these have five wheels...\n\n4 WHEELS: SWEDISH STRIDSVAGN FM/30 L-30 CONVERTIBLE TANK/ARMOURED-CAR: 1931\n\nLeft: Stridsvagn FM/30 L-30 convertible tank/armored-car: 1931\n\nShown here with the wheels down.\n\nThis remarkable vehicle certainly has four wheels, but it also has a pair of\ncaterpillar tracks. It also has a complicated history.\n\nThe vehicle was designed and constructed by the German engineer Joseph\nVollmer, who was at the time co-owner of the German Automobile Construction\nCompany (DAC). The manufacture of tanks was forbidden in the German Reich due\nto the Treaty of Versailles. To evade this, the the GHH (Gute Hoffnungs-H\ufffdtte)\nsteelworks group, based in Oberhausen had acquired the Landsverk company in\nLandskrona, Sweden. Vehicles and engines were designed and then sold as\ncomplete factory drawings against future royalty payments.\n\nThe FM30 had a 150 HP engine, weighed 11.5 tons and could exceed 45 mph (75\nkm/h) on the road using its wheels, and 20 mph (35 km/h) across country using\nits tracks. To convert to tracked operation, both sets of wheels were raised\nuntil the top of them were level with the tank deck. The transition to wheeled\nmode took about 30 seconds and could be done on the move. The armour was proof\nonly against small-arms fire.\n\nLeft: Stridsvagn FM/30 L-30 convertible tank/armored-car: 1931\n\nShown here with the wheels up.\n\nThe armament was a Bofors 37mm gun (122 rounds carried) and 6.5mm machine-gun.\n(4000 rounds carried) For some reason the machine-gun was mounted in a short\nfat cylinder. Note the hatch on each side of the turret.\n\nPerhaps predictably, the dual-drive system was complex to manufacture and too\nfragile for military use. Tests took place in 1935-36, but the single example\nwas relegated to training until 1940. It has been preserved and can be seen in\nthe Swedish Arsenalen Museum in Str\ufffdngn\ufffds. Their website is here.\n\nThere is a very short Wikipedia page for the FM/30.\n\n4/6 WHEELS: SWEDISH FM-29 ARMOURED-CAR: 1932\n\nLeft: The Swedish FM29 armoured car: 1932\n\nThis Swedish armoured car design resembled the German one just below in that\nit had four wheels in normal use, plus two spare wheels which were mounted so\nthey contacted the ground in rough country and prevent the vehicle getting\nstuck; it's another case of 'is this a 4 or 6-wheeled vehicle'?. The four main\nwheels were driven and steered at each end.\n\nThe wheels in the picture are hidden behind the pentagonal armour plates. The\nrear of the vehicle is towards the camera, and tyres contacting the road can\nbe seen at each end- but the middle pentagonal plate has no tyre visible under\nit. The phrase 'rear of the vehicle' is a bit of a doubtful one in this case:\nthe FM29 had a driver and controls at each end, allowing for some\nspectacularly rapid retreats.\n\nYou may be worried that this armoured car appears to be equipped with a pair\nof torpedo tubes. In fact the two circular hatches cover the headlights; the\nheadlights at the 'rear of the vehicle'.\n\nOnly one example was ever completed; the design proved too big and heavy, and\ntoo expensive.\n\nMany thanks to Tulle R\ufffdnnmyr for bringing this vehicle to my attention.\n\nLeft: Swedish FM29 armoured car chassis: 1932\n\nThe FM29 demonstrates its ability to deal with a hump, though the spare wheels\naren't actually doing anything at the moment. It also gives a very good view\nof the front and back driving positions.\n\nThe disc wheels formed part of the protection of the crew. The engine can be\nseen at the rear of the vehicle. (To the right)\n\nMany thanks to Tulle R\ufffdnnmyr for bringing this vehicle to my attention.\n\n4 WHEELS: THE ADMK MULUS: 1935\n\nLeft: The ADMK Mulus with all four wheels up: 1935\n\nThe Austrian ADMK Mulus was a light machine-gun carrier vehicle that, like the\nStridsvagn FM/30 above, could proceed either on its tracks or on its four\nwheels. It does not qualify as a tankette because it had no armour at all.\n\nThe front wheels could be swung upward on their gear-driven suspension arms.\nThey could then be removed and put into brackets at the rear of the vehicle.\nThe rear wheels could also be removed, but this was a more complicated process\nthat required driving the tracks up onto blocks.\n\nIt has been written that a unique feature was that the front arms acted as a\nframework for the driver's seat, but so far no information on how this worked\nhas been found.\n\nIt was first produced in prototype quantities in 1935, and continued in\nproduction until 1938. Total production was 334 units; 302 of them in 1936.\nThe Mulus was taken over by the German army after the 1938 Anschluss, but does\nnot seem to have had much use, probably because it was underpowered, only\nhaving a 20 HP engine to move a 1.5 ton vehicle. Some were used in training\nfor Operation Sealion.\n\nThe Mulus has a short Wikipedia page. In German, but Google Translate does a\ngood job.\n\n* Weight: 1.56 tons\n* Engine: Daimler air-cooled 4 cylinder 20 HP\n* Speed: On tracks 10 mph, on wheels 27 mph\n\nLeft: The ADMK Mulus with all four wheels down: 1935\n\nHere a two-wheeled trailer is towed.\n\n4 WHEELS: THE AUSTRIAN RR7: 1936\n\nLeft: The Austrian RR7: 1936\n\nThe RR7 was another wheeled/tracked vehicle from Austria. It was developed in\n1936 by the Swiss Saurer Company to serve as an artillery tractor. The\nchangeover from wheels to tracks could be done while the vehicle was moving at\na slow speed.\n\nAfter testing, an order was an order was placed in 1937, but only 12 vehicles\nwere built before the 1938 Anschluss. After this manufacture continued, and a\ntotal of 140 units were built; there might have been more, but the RR7 had\npoor handling and was difficult to steer.\n\nThe new German name for the RR7 was Sd Kfz 254. It had a 4-cylinder 70 HP\ndiesel engine.\n\nThere is a short Wikipedia page on the Sd Kfz 254.\n\n4/6 WHEELS: MIDDLE-WEIGHT AND HEAVY EINHEITS-PKW 1936\n\nLeft: Middle-weight Einheits-PKW with central wheels: 1936\n\nBetween 1936 and 1943 the Wehrmacht was supplied with Einheits-PKW (German for\n'standard passenger cars') in the three versions; light, medium and heavy.\nThese vehicles were supposed to provide cross-country mobility. They proved\ntoo complicated and expensive, their place being taken by the Volkswagen\nKubelwagon, which proved capable of dealing with rough terrain despite only\nhaving two-wheel drive.\n\nShown here is the middle-weight version. On each side a spare wheel was\nmounted on a bearing, so it could rotate freely if it contacted the ground and\nso prevented the chassis grounding. While this feature seems rather ingenious,\nit must have failed to earn its keep as it was removed in 1940 to simplify the\nbodywork and make more room inside.\n\nSo- is that four wheels or six?\n\nMany thanks to Bernd F and Pavel Panenka for drawing this machine to my\nattention.\n\nLeft: Heavy-weight Einheits-PKW with central wheels: 1936\n\nThis is very much the same as the middle-weight version, though the spare\nwheels are recessed further into the bodywork.\n\nSo- is that four wheels or six? Nobody's counting the two wheels on the gun\nbeing towed.\n\nMany thanks to Bernd F and Pavel Panenka for drawing this machine to my\nattention.\n\n3/4 WHEELS: THE HAYWOOD LHW SPECIAL: 1938\n\nLeft: The Haywood LHW Special: 1938\n\nThe Haywood special was designed to exploit a feature of the rules in the\nInternational Six Days Trial held in Wales in 1938. The trials were intended\nfor motorcycles and motorcycle-sidecar combinations, the latter having three\nwheels. According to the rules two wheels counted as one providing they were\nless than a foot (30 cm) apart. The special was based on an Austin Seven, and\nwas built by three men called Lloyd, Hughes & Williams, and hence the LHW.\n\nNo information has so far been found as to how successful this scheme was, or\nwhat their fellow-competitors thought about it, but the Museum staff are on\nthe case.\n\nThe car has been preserved and is currently owned by Iain Richardson.\n\nLeft: The Haywood LHW Special: 1938\n\nThe Austin Seven axle was cut down until only the differential remained.\n\nLeft: The Haywood LHW Special: 1938\n\nA contemporary picture of the Haywood LHW Special.\n\n4 WHEELS: HOME GUARD AMBULANCE: 1941\n\nLeft: Home Guard diamond configuration ambulance: 10 August 1941\n\nThe Home Guard was a local defence organisation formed in Great Britain at the\nstart of the Second World War. This one-person ambulance was intended for the\ntransport of victims of war gases. (a threat which never materialised) It\nlooks like a delivery tricycle with a much extended load carrier, supported by\nan extra wheel at the front.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how the steering worked. It looks as though the front\nsection swivelled with respect to the rear of the tricycle, and moving it to\nchange direction would need a lot of muscular exertion; the front wheel\nappears to be simply a castor. The wheels make up a diamond pattern like that\nof the Sunbeam-Mabley at the start of this section.\n\nThere is an odd-shaped box on the front, of unknown function.\n\nNote curtains that can be let down on each side to keep out gas. Also, with\ngas in mind the rider is wearing his box respirator on his chest.\n\nThis picture is about on the Net, with claims it was the first ever ambulance;\nthis is of course nonsense.\n\n4 WHEELS: PININFARINA-X PROJECT: 1960\n\nLeft: Pininfarina-X project: 1960\n\nThe Pininfarina-X project showcased its low-drag body design, with a drag\ncoefficient of only 0.23, far superior to the ordinary cars of the time.\nBatista Pininfarina worked with aerodynamics expert Professor Alberto Morelli.\nTo achieve such low drag the front of the car had to be narrow, leading to\nthis unorthodox layout with one wheel in front, two at the side, and one at\nthe rear. The front wheel did the steering and the rear wheel all the driving.\n\nA 1089cc Fiat engine was installed at an angle in the rear of the car. This\nodd arrangement was made necessary by the rear three wheels being close\ntogether. This must have made for an assymetrical weight distribution and one\nwonders if that affected the handlng.\n\nThe project was a successful technology demonstrator up to a point, but a\nsingle front wheel was never going to be acceptable in mainstream motoring.\nThe car was eventually bought by a collector and still exists.\n\nYou can find more information here.\n\n4 WHEELS: SQUARE-WHEELED PICKUP\n\nYou're not going to get a car with four conventionally-placed wheels on this\npage, unless there's something very funny about the wheels. I think this car\nqualifies; it has four square wheels.\n\nLeft: Square wheels on a four-wheel pickup\n\nThis is from a Mythbusters episode. Interestingly the jolting gets less as\nspeed increases because the wheels are bouncing from one corner to the\nopposite one, the intermediate corner not touching the ground.\n\nThere is a YouTube video, posted in 2016.\n\nIt is slightly disturbing that this is far from a unique occurrence of square\nwheels. Typing 'square wheels' into YouTube produces scooters, bicycles,\ntricycles, tractors, motorbikes and skateboards, all with square wheels.\n\nPresumably the ultimate Perverse Wheel would be an equilateral triangle.\n\n### 5 WHEELS\n\n5 WHEELS: THE PENTACYCLE\n\nThis is not strictly a car or motor vehicle, but when you are looking for\n5-wheeled vehicles you can't afford to be too fussy.\n\nLeft: Burstow's Pentacycle: 1882\n\nThe Pentacycle was designed for delivering the post; it was patented by\narchitect Edward Burstow (1821-91) in 1882. He is otherwise unknown to the\nInternet. It underwent trials with postmen in Horsham, England, and they\napparently liked it, but apparently other areas were less enthusiatic and it\nwas not adopted. Edward Burstow is buried in Denne Road Cemetery, Horsham. He\nwas also responsible for designing the Corn Exchange, West Street, Horsham.\n\nThe thinking behind the design is obscure. The use of a large driving wheel\navoided using gears or a chain to get up a decent speed, as in a penny-\nfarthing, but at that date gearing was starting to be adopted. The use of what\nare essentially four stabiliser wheels to protect the health of the postman\n(going head-first over the front of a penny-farthing could easily be fatal) is\nlaudable, but since there is no suspension, it would seem that it would be\nimpossible to keep all five wheels on the ground, especially given the state\nof the roads at that time. If the centre wheel failed to grip the road you\nwould go nowhere.\n\nThe machine steers on both the front and rear little wheels; otherwise it\nwould probably have never got round corners at all. Note the lever to the\nright and below the pedals that changes the direction of the steering action\nso that the small-wheel axles steer in opposite directions.\n\nThe Pentacycle was often described as the 'hen and chickens' machine because\nit allegedly resembled a hen surrounded by four chicks.\n\nThe Pentacycle has a Wikipedia page.\n\nLeft: Burstow's Pentacycle: 1882\n\nThis cigarette card suggests that the official name for the machine was\n'centre cycle', and other sources confirm this.\n\nLeft: Burstow's Pentacycle: 1882\n\nThis is one of the very few contemporary photograph of a centre cycle in use.\nThe machine appears to be fitted with shelves rather than baskets, and there\nare two pouches strapped to the frame on the left.\n\nAccording to the Postal Museum: \"Postmen complained that the cycle wore out\ntheir trousers in the crotch, leaving them with holes in their uniform. Since\nthey had to pay for their own uniforms, they refused to use the cycle and it\nwas consigned to the scrap heap.\"\n\nSounds like the design of the saddle could have been improved. Why wasn't it?\n\nLeft: The Horsham fleet of centre-cycles: 1882\n\nThere appear to be at least two, and possibly three sizes of centre-wheel\nshown here.\n\nThis photograph seems to have been taken at the same location as the one just\nabove; presumably it was the yard of the Horsham Post office.\n\nLeft: The USA patent for the centre-cycle: 1881\n\nEdward Burstow clearly thought it was worthwhile to get a US patent for his\nmachine.\n\nThe upper diagram shows the levers connecting the steering wheels at back and\nfront. There is however no sign of the lever which caused the small-wheel\naxles to steer in opposite directions.\n\n5 WHEELS: THE PHELPS TRACTOR\n\nFinding a car with five wheels was always going to be a challenge. However the\nMuseum staff are not easily defeated...\n\nLeft: Advert for the The Phelps Tractor: 1901\n\nThe Phelps Tractor was an ingenious idea that failed to become popular. The\nsteam-powered propelling section was a three-wheeled unit controlled by\nsteering rods from behind. Presumably this was to reassure potential\npurchasers who were more used to driving horses and wanted no truck with new-\nfangled notions like steering wheels.\n\nThe propelling unit could be coupled to a carriage (Combination 2) or a parcel\nwagon (Combination 3, with extra storage over the engine compartment) or any\nother suitable trailer unit. This included sledges.\n\nThe advert at left describes how to steer, start, stop, and reverse, with the\nuseful feature that the engine stops if the rods or reins are dropped or\notherwise released entirely.\n\nIt think the top version has a reasonable claim to be a 5-wheeled car; you\ncouldn't drive the tractor unit around by itself. The claim of the lower\nversion to be a 7-wheeled car is more dubious, as the trailer is essentially a\nseparate vehicle.\n\nThere seems to be much doubt as to whether this machine was actually built-\nthere appear to be no photographs. I have grave doubts as to the practicality\nof fitting a 10-HP steam engine, complete with fuel and water tanks, in an\nenclosure the size of that shown in the top picture. Significantly, no chimney\nis shown to carry away the boiler exhaust gases, and there is no sign of an\nair-cooled condenser, which would be a sizable item.\n\n5 WHEELS: A TRUE FIVE-WHEELED CAR\n\nLeft: Car with central fifth wheel: 1911\n\nWhile there could be argument about some of the vehicles in this section, this\nis I think beyond dispute a true five-wheeled car. Details are sadly lacking\nbut it appears that the amount of load taken by the fifth wheel could be\nadjusted as the vehicle moved along.\n\nThe inventor claims \"the elimination of compensating gears and complicated\nmechanism\". I suspect 'compensating gears' means a differential on the driving\naxle; close examination of the photograph shows there is a chain drive to the\nfifth wheel, but no chains going to the rear axle. It therefore appears that\nthe fifth wheel was the sole means of propulsion, which might be expected to\ncause problems with traction. It is not easy to see what good having a\nvariable load on this wheel would do; using a block-and-tackle in the\nmechanism suggests a certain lack of mechanical sophistication. In all, it\ndoes not appear to me to be a good idea.\n\nSource: Popular Mechanics March 1911. Many thanks to Kerry Stiff for drawing\nthis machine to my attention.\n\n5 WHEELS: THE DETROIT TRACTOR\n\nLeft: Advert for the Detroit Tractor: 1913\n\nThe Phelps Tractor was not unique in its rein-control. The Detroit Tractor\n(which judging by these photographs really was built) had a more practical\ninternal-combustion engine. It is not clear why the towing pole was so long-\nit may have been something to do with using unmodified horse-drawn ploughs,\netc.\n\nI appreciate that neither of these configurations qualify as a 5-wheeled car,\nthough they might as 6-wheeled and 4-wheeled. But I thought it best to show\nthem here for comparison with the Phelps tractor just above.\n\nThe Detroit Tractor Company was an overshoot of Baker & Baker of Royal Oak,\nMichigan. It was set up in March 1913 to build Baker tractors, but a few years\nlater moved to Lafayette, Indiana where this machine was built. It was\ndescribed as 'a line-drive tractor of the universal frame design'. Presumably\n'line-drive' refers to the rein-control system, but I don't understand about\nthe 'universal frame design'.\n\nFrom an automobile trade journal 1913\n\nYou wait ages for a 5-wheeled car and then three come along at once... more\nresearch revealed these beauties below:\n\n5 WHEELS: THE SMITH FLYER\n\nLeft: The Smith Flyer: 1917\n\nThe Smith Flyer was a four-wheel buckboard with a Smith Motor-wheel attached\nat the back. It seems to have been intended for fun rather than serious\ntransport.\n\nNonetheless, I feel obliged to point an obvious snag. The fifth wheel is\nclearly hinged to the back of the vehicle, to allow it follow irregularities\nin the road. Thus only the weight of engine and one wheel is available for\nadhesion. The traction abilities must have diabolical.\n\nIt is often cited as the cheapest car ever sold, but that means stretching the\ndefinition of 'car' to breaking point. It was no competition for the Model-T\nFord, which could be had for a few hundred dollars more.\n\nLeft: The Smith Flyer: 1917\n\nThe caption is informative. However, in the list of its desirable features (I\nlike the 'natural woodwork') there is no mention of... brakes. There is no\nmention of suspension either; there wasn't any beyond the flexing of the\nchassis. It does however have front and rear mudguards.\n\nI marvel at the idea of raising the whole engine and wheel to declutch; this\nis less practical with a V8. There is no mention of a throttle control, which\nwould have required a Bowden cable; it says 'Control is under the thumb on the\nsteering wheel', which I take to mean an ignition cutout switch. And there\ncertainly wasn't a gearbox.\n\nSorry about the moire. Nothing to be done at this stage.\n\nAbove: The Smith Flyer: 1917\n\nThis magnificent photograph captures a Smith Flyer superbly. The Smith Motor-\nwheel with its distinctive two mounting horns, has in this case a belt-driven\n4-blade cooling fan. The diagonal wire attached to the engine is presumably\nthe 'clutch control' for raising the engine and wheel off the road.\n\nLeft: A Smith Flyer: picture date unknown\n\nPictured at what appears to be a tractor rally. This restored Flyer has a\n5-blade belt-driven cooling fan.\n\nLeft: The Smith Motor Wheel: 1914\n\nThis shows the conventional application of the Smith Motor Wheel; you bolted\nit to the side of your bicycle converting it into a sort of tricycle. The\nSmith Motor Wheel first appeared in 1914.\n\nThe Smith Motor Wheel was an ingenious design. The disc wheel was driven\ndirectly from the cam-shaft, which was geared down 8:1 to give a suitable\ndrive ratio. However the camshaft of a 4-stroke engine must rotate at half\nengine-speed; Smith got round this by having four lobes rather than one on\neach cam. This ingenious idea was borrowed from the Wall Motor Wheel, invented\nin England in 1910, of which Smith had bought the US manufacturing rights. The\nWall Motor Wheel used a 4:1 reduction ratio and a two-lobed exhaust cam; the\ninlet valve was automatic.\n\n5 WHEELS: SIDEWAYS PARKING IN 1924\n\nLeft: Parking with a fifth Wheel: 1924\n\nOnce again an earlier implementation of five-wheel parking has been\ndiscovered. Lowering the fifth wheel and turning it in either direction was\ndone by wire cables and a pulley on the engine. No further details currently\nknown.\n\nSource: Popular Mechanics for Dec 1924, p892\n\n5 WHEELS: SIDEWAYS PARKING IN 1933\n\nLeft: Parking with a fifth Wheel: 1933\n\nIt has emerged that the Brookes Walker Fifth Wheel (see just below) was not\nthe first of its kind. This picture is taken from a video posted on Facebook\nby Road & Track magazine. The mechanism is activated by the driver pulling a\nrod out of the dashboard. Quite what is activated is currently unknown, but\nprobably hydraulics. Close examination shows that the fifth wheel is driven by\na chain.\n\nThe mechanism works quickly and smoothly, and looks like a first-class job of\nengineering.\n\nYou can see the video here.\n\nThe only information in the soundtrack is that the inventor lived in\nCalifornia; this is confirmed by the licence plate, which also gives the date\nof 1933. The car is a four-door Packard.\n\nLeft: Parking with a fifth Wheel: 1930s\n\nThe activating control pulled fully out of the dashboard.\n\n5 WHEELS: RACING CAR IN 1933\n\nLeft: Fifth Wheel for safe tyre testing: 1950s\n\nThe text pretty much says it all.\n\nSource: Popular Science July 1933, p12\n\n5 WHEELS: SIDEWAYS PARKING IN 1938-1952\n\nLeft: The Brookes Walker Fifth Wheel: 1950s\n\nThe huge barge-like cars produced in the USA in the 50's were hard to park in\nspaces of limited size. Here is one attempted solution; a fifth wheel that\nlefts the normal rear wheels off the road and allows the back of the car to go\nsideways. It could be argued that the car was a three-wheeler during this\noperation, as only three wheels were actually touching the road. A hydraulic\ncylinder lowered the fifth wheel, which was then rotated by a friction roller\ndriven from the rear axle.\n\nFor a long time nothing was currently known beyond the existence of this\nphotograph. It can now be revealed that this Cadillac is using the Park-Car\nconcept invented by Brooks Walker in the 1930s. US patent 2,139,341 was\napplied for in 1932 but only granted in 1938.\n\nNow you may object to carrying around the weight of an extra wheel just to\nhelp with parking. But the beauty of the concept is that it doubles as the\nspare wheel, and the only extra weight is that of the raise/lower mechanism.\n\nThere is a video of the fifth wheel in operation on YouTube.\n\n* There are two friction rollers here that need to have a good grip on their respective tyres. How well is that going to work in the wet?\n* The friction roller 41 bears not on the tread of its tyre but on its sidewall. Tyre sidewalls are not designed for that sort of duty and would quickly wear and become dangerous- on the inside sidewall which is hard to inspect.\n* Finally, what about the differential? Once both rear wheels are of the ground, trying to apply power through tyre 40 is just going to make the opposite rear wheel spin uselessly.\n\nLeft: The Fifth Wheel: 1950s\n\nThis installation takes up most of the room in the boot (trunk) and apparently\nthe petrol tank has also had to be moved- quite a major rebuild.\n\nFrom a Life article, 17 Nov 1952 (The issue that reported the victory of\nEisenhower over Adlai Stevenson)\n\nLeft: The Fifth Wheel: 1950s\n\nThis photograph shows chain drive to the fifth wheel, alleged taken from the\npropellor shaft, though it is far from clear exactly how that worked.\n\nNot to be pedantic, but I can only see one hydraulic cylinder here, at bottom\nright. The other tubular things are parts of the bracket holding the fifth\nwheel.\n\nFrom the Life article of 17 Nov 1952\n\nLeft: The Fifth Wheel: 1950s\n\nFrom the Life article of 17 Nov 1952\n\nLeft: The Fifth Wheel: 1950s\n\nMultiple-exposure photography demonstrates the parking process. The car on the\nleft can get into a much smaller parking space by swinging its rear in.\n\nFrom the Life article of 17 Nov 1952\n\nLeft: Fifth Wheel: 1953 Packard\n\nThis 1953 Packard Cavalier was converted by Brooks Walker and used as his\npersonal transportation; it still survives. This time the fifth wheel lives\noutside the boot, (trunk) which leaves the luggage space intact. Presumably\nmoving the petrol tank was also not necessary. Definitely a more practical\nproposition.\n\nLeft: The Fifth Wheel: 1953 Packard\n\nAccording to the latest information I can find, the Packard is currently owned\nby William Swaney of Pennsylvania, who bought it in December 2005. The\nhydraulic system has been rebuilt, and is fully operational, so the car can go\nround in complete circles if the owner so desires.\n\n5 WHEELS BY HOBART BROWN- THE LOWELL KINETIC SCULPTURE RACE: 1969\n\nLeft: Five-wheeler by Hobart Brown: 1969\n\nThe first Lowell Kinetic Sculpture Race was held in 1969 in Ferndale,\nCalifornia. Local artist Hobart Brown modified his son Justin's tricycle by\nadding two more wheels, though it's hard to see much trace of a tricycle here\napart from the two big wheels. There is pedal drive to the front wheel by a\nchain.\n\nThe little wheel at the back seems to be collapsing under the strain.\n\nThere was a 2003 article on Hobart Brown in the North Coast Journal.\n\nLeft: Five-wheeler by Hobart Brown: 1969\n\nThe Brown pentacycle is preserved in the a kinetic sculpture museum. I think\nit's this one.\n\nThat bent wheel still hasn't been fixed. Perhaps it's part of the artistic\neffect.\n\nLeft: Five-wheeler by Hobart Brown: 1969\n\nThe caption says it all.\n\nDon Clausen has a Wikipedia page.\n\n5 WHEELS BY ZARKA AND VINCENT LAMOUROUX: 2001\n\nLeft: Five-wheeler by Raphael Zarka and Vincent Lamouroux: 2001\n\nThis pentacycle was designed with one specific application in mind; it was to\nride along the abandoned track of the French Aerotrain project. It does look\nas if this is a unique case where five wheels really are required. Two of the\nballoon-like wheels support the rear of the pentacycle on the ground, while\nthe single wheel at the front supports it on top of the big concrete rail. The\ntwo wheels on vertical axles guide the pentacycle laterally.\n\nThere is more info here.\n\n5 WHEELS BY MICHAEL SALERNO: 2008\n\nLeft: Five wheeled bike built by Michael Salerno: 2008\n\nThe machine was in course of construction by Michael Salerno when this\nphotograph was taken; the chain is missing. A sequence of photographs describe\nthe construction process on Flickr.\n\nThere seems to be no suspension so the question arises of how often all five\nwheels will be touching the ground.\n\nThis image is also on a site promoting the music of Jaapur and Machoo here.\nThey have a track called Pentacycle. Don't listen it, it's bad. In fact, it's\nterrible.\n\nLeft: Five-wheeler by Michael Salerno: 2008\n\nThe machine in one version of 'finished', with handlebars. They were later\nreplaced by a miniature ship's wheel.\n\nNote the fancy backrest.\n\n5 WHEELS IN EGYPT: 2014\n\nLeft: The Brooks Walker idea reborn.\n\nThis modification was done in Egypt. The car is an old-style Renault 5. I use\nto have a Renault 5TS, and it was a good and fast car. But I was tempted away\nby the Peugeot 205 GTi; (1.6 litre version) lovely car, wish I still had it.\n\nThere is a video of the fifth wheel doing its stuff on YouTube. It was\nuploaded in 2014\n\nThe more fastidious of readers may be complaining at this point that the\nBrooks Walker fifth-wheel and its Egyptian successor may be using a bright\nidea, but it does not have all five wheels on the ground at the same time, and\nso does not count as a five-wheeled car any more than does a four-wheel car\nwith a spare wheel in the boot. See if I care.\n\nBe aware that the term 'fifth wheel' is often used to describe the horizontal\nturntable on which an articulated trailer pivots. See Wikipedia.\n\nThere is also the idiom \"About as much use as a fifth wheel.\" which makes no\nsense because there are times when a spare wheel really comes in handy.\n\n5 WHEELS IN VIETNAM: 2016\n\nLeft: Five wheeled car in Vietnam: 2016\n\nNothing is known about this vehicle except the video on YouTube, entitled '5\nwheel super-car of the man Vietnam', which presumably at least locates the\ncountry. At any rate they drive on the right. If anyone knows any more I would\nbe glad to hear it.\n\nThere is a video of the car driving off at YouTube. It sounds like it's\npowered by a motorcycle engine.\n\nDate of construction currently unknown. The video was posted in May 2016\n\nLeft: Five wheeled car in Vietnam: 2016\n\nThe back wheel looks like the rear wheel from a heavy motorcycle to me.\n\nLeft: More views of the Vietnamese five-wheeled car: 2016\n\nThis article (dated 15 May 2015) when translated, says the builder is a Mr.\nNguyen Van Thang, who apparently has no formal engineering or mechanical\ntraining.\n\nA distinctly impressive achievement!\n\nLeft: Five-wheeled John Deere vehicle: current\n\nThis is a John Deere Gator, in a five-wheeled version. Stu tells me it is most\noften seen transporting injured American football players from the field.\nGator are made in a variety of configurations, with either four, five or six\nwheels. You can see a 5-wheel Gator in the first part of this YouTube video.\n\nThanks to Stu Riegel for bringing this to my attention.\n\n### 6 WHEELS\n\n6 WHEELS: ARTICULATED CARRIAGE PULLED BY HEILMANN TRACTOR: 1898\n\nLeft: Carriage pulled by Heilmann tractor: 1898\n\nEarly cars were naturally based on horse-drawn vehicles, but this design takes\nthat philosophy further than most. The horses are here replaced by a 4-wheel\ntractor unit.\n\nThis remarkable vehicle has now been identified as the landau of Grand Duke\nAlexis of Russia, drawn by a Heilmann electric tractor circa 1898.\n\nThat is the same Heilmann who produced a remarkable steam-electric locomotive.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE PULLMAN CAR 1903\n\nThe Pullman marque was manufactured in Pennsylvania by the York Motor Car\nCompany from 1905 to 1917.\n\nLeft: The Pullman car: 1903\n\nHere's one way to arrange six wheels on a car. This wheel configuration is\nvery rare, and was thought to be unique until the Lorraine Dietrich car\n(below) was discovered. When the middle wheels encountered a high spot in the\nroad, the car had an unhappy tendency to rock back and forwards.\n\nThe Pullman car was not a success. It crashed into a telegraph pole within a\nyear of its construction, very probably due to instability in the steering\nbehaviour. Its parts were used in more conventional cars. The year of building\nis usually given as 1903, which seems to indicate it was prototype built\nbefore Pullman went into mass production in 1905.\n\nPullman went bankrupt and ceased operations in 1917.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE PRATT CAR 1907\n\nCharles T. Pratt of Frankfort, New York, was like Reeves, an industrialist,\nowning the Pratt Chuck Works. He built this 6-wheeled one-off, with a 'triple\nphaeton' body.\n\nLeft: The Charles T Pratt car: 1907\n\nThe car was powered by an unidentified 75 HP engine. Its wheelbase -\npresumably measured between front and rear axles - was 168 inches. The\nHorseless Age wrote:\n\n##### \"The wheels are mounted on lengthwise members, which are pivoted to the\nrear springs in each side. By this mode of support much less shock is\ntransmitted to the body of the car than is ordinarily the case, since\ninequalities in the road, causing a rise or depression of one of the four\nwheels, will raise or depress the body spring by only half that amount,\nprovided the other wheel on the same side remains on the level.\"  \n  \n---  \n  \nPratt told the press that he built the car only for his own use, but\nnontheless he took out two patents: US 842,245 - (Running Gear for\nAutomobiles) in January 1907, and US 888,737 - (Automobile Running-Gear) in\nMay 1908.\n\nUnlike the Sextoauto, this six-wheeler apparently used both forward and centre\naxles for steering and the rear axle for propulsion. Since the 'centre' wheel\nis well towards the back this does not sound like a very practical\nproposition, but that is what is shown in US 842,245.\n\nSearching for Pratt cars will only bring up George and Bill Pratt, who began\ncar production in 1909. There appears to be no connection.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE LORRAINE DIETRICH CAR 1908\n\nLeft: The Lorraine Dietrich: 1908\n\nThis six-wheeled car was produced by the Soci\ufffdt\ufffd Lorraine Dietrich apparently\nin 1908, though one source states 1903/4. The makers described it as an\n'omnibus'. The rear section was stated to be a fourgon or baggage-van.\n\nIt had a 40 HP engine and a maximum speed of 55 to 62 mph (90-100 km/hr) and\naccording to some accounts driven by the four rear wheels. This needs\nconfirmation- the chain drive to the centre wheels can be seen just to the\nleft of the tyre, but not so any chains to the rear axle. However if you had\nrear wheels, surely you would drive them? Other accounts suggest that the rear\nwheels were steerable, but not driven.\n\nThe first and third axles could slide axially, which was claimed to allow a\nvery small turning-circle, equivalent to that of a car half the length. It\nsounds like that might make for some interesting handling. However\ncontemporary writers enquired anxiously about the true size of its turning\ncircle.\n\nJust above the driver's position, a speaking tube can be seen. This allowed\nthe passengers to give the driver instructions without the inconvenience of\nopening a window.\n\nThanks to Pavel Panenko for bringing this vehicle to my attention.\n\nLeft: The Lorraine Dietrich: 1908\n\nAnother view of the Lorraine Dietrich six-wheeled car. It was commissioned by\nBaron Herrmann von Eckhardstein, [1864-1933] who was first secretary at the\nGerman embassy in London from 1891 to 1901. Though never the ambassador, as\nthe first secretary he performed most of the functions of one.\n\nThe car boasted a silver sink with hot and cold running water, electric\nlighting and heating, and a dashboard fitted with every imaginable instrument.\nThe fourgon actually held a fully equipped kitchen in which Emil, the chef,\nprepared gourmet meals. Entry to this kitchen was naturally via a tradesman's\nentrance at the rear of the car.\n\nThe car is said to have had a wheelbase of 3.80 metres; this is presumably the\ndistance between adjacent axles, rather than the overall wheelbase. The six-\nwheel suspension was based on a patent owned by Turcat-M\ufffdry, motor\nmanufacturers from 1899 until 1928.\n\nLeft: The Lorraine Dietrich: 1910\n\nThis diagram of the six-wheel arrangement was published in a book in 1910.\nThere are four linked leaf-springs on each side. The inner pair of springs\npivot on the chassis at their centres.\n\nThe sprocket for the chain drive is shown as a circle just to the right of the\ncentre wheel; the chain is not shown.\n\nLeft: The Lorraine Dietrich: 1908\n\nThe six-wheeled car appears to have been preceded by this unconventional six-\nwheel lorry.This is one of the many Lorraine-Dietrich lorries that brought\nsupplies to the 400,000 troops engaged in the Grandes Southwestern maneuvers\nin France in 1907.\n\nThe four leaf springs visible are arranged as in the diagram above; in this\ncase the driving chain sprocket is ahead of the centre axle. No drive chain to\nthe rear wheel is visble.\n\nThe centre wheels are bigger than the front and rear, and their tyres are\nbigger too, supporting the idea that only the centre wheels were driven. Also,\ndifferent size wheels at the back would have required a different gear ratio\nto drive them. Add to this that if the rear wheels HAD to be steerable, to get\nan acceptable turning radius with the axle layout, applying power to them as\nwell is going to give you all the difficulties of front-wheel drive\ntechnology- specifically a need for constant-velocity joints. Perhaps this is\nwhy the idea did not thrive- it limits you to just driving the centre axle,\nwhich is not going to give good traction.\n\nLeft: Turcat-Mery six-wheel charabanc: 1905\n\nThis six-wheel prototype was built by Turcat-M\ufffdry in 1905. The patent involved\nwas actually granted to Charles Lindecker of Briancon in France. Presumably\nTurcat-M\ufffdry had bought the patent or taken out a licence to exploit it.\n\nThis photograph shows the middle axle in a hole; note how the inner ends of\nthe springs on the front and rear axles have been raised, reducing the load on\nthem.\n\nLeft: Six-wheel suspension from Charles Lindecker's US patent 838,343: 1906\n\nThe patent shows four methods of interconnecting the suspension of the three\naxles so that they will take equal shares of the load even if the ground is\nuneven; all are the same in principle but the fourth method, shown here, is\nthe simplest mechanically, and the one used by Turcat-Mery and Lorraine\nDietrich.\n\nHere the springs 4 do double duty as balance levers, transferring loads to and\nfrom the front and rear axles; they are pivoted on the chassis at their\ncentres, indicated by two small circles. The centre axle is located by the\nradius arm 9; when the centre axle encounters a hole, it tends to sink, which\ncauses springs 4 to swivel on their pivots and raise the inner ends of springs\n3 by means of the little links. This reduces the load on the front and rear\naxles.\n\nThe load distribution could be changed by varying the lengths of the\nsuspension components.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE SEXTOAUTO 1912\n\nThe Reeves Sexto-Auto actually came after the Reeves Octo-Auto, described\nbelow. Faced with no orders at all for the Octo-Auto, Reeves claimed he could\n\"Get as good results with six wheels as with eight\" which rather invites the\nquestion of why he used eight in the first place. The Sexto-Auto involved\nrather more rebuilding than just removing the Octo-Auto's front axle, as the\naxle behind it has been moved forward to a position under the radiator.\n\nLeft: The Reeves Sexto-Auto: 1912\n\nI am very doubtful if 'Tire trouble and expense actually reduced' was a\nrealistic claim.\n\nLeft: The Reeves Sexto-Auto: 1912\n\nThe only Sexto-Auto ever built.\n\nLeft: The Reeves Sexto-Auto: 1912\n\nIt's all very well claiming that there is 'No shock, no jolt, no rebound', but\nhow is that actually accomplished? Even if we accept that four wheels at the\nback give a much superior ride, the front two wheels are entirely conventional\nand so you would presumably get the usual amount of shock, jolt, and rebound\nfrom them.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE MELBOURNE FIRE ENGINE: 1916\n\nLeft: Horse-drawn Melbourne fire engine converted to motor drive: 1916\n\nThis bizarre vehicle was built by shortening a heavy touring car, by moving\nits rear axle to just behind the gearbox, removing the rear wheels, and fixing\nit to the chassis side-members. The rear springs were reversed and rested on\nthe front axle of the fire engine. That is the middle set of wheels visible;\nthey were chain-driven from what had been the car rear axle.\n\nThe original front axle of the fire-engine swivelled, and this was presumably\nretained to avoid a long rigid wheelbase, so it was effectively an articulated\nvehicle. It was built because there had been a spate of serious accidents when\npeople tried to tow fire-engines with cars.\n\nFrom the Melbourne Herald (Australia) for Monday 23 Oct 1916. See here.\n\nThanks to Ben Hurkett for drawing this to my attention.\n\nLeft: Horse-drawn Melbourne fire engine converted to motor drive: 1916\n\nHere's a rather better picture that hasn't been through newspaper rotogravure.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE CLARIN-MUSTAD: 1917\n\nLeft: The Clarin-Mustad: 1917\n\nThis Norwegian car was a one of two six-wheelers built in the years 1916-1917\nby Hans Clarin Hovind Mustad, one of the earliest automotive pioneers in\nNorway.\n\nThe front wheels steered, the middle wheels were both steered and driven, and\nthe rear wheels simply driven. This car is supposed to be the first to be\nfitted with directional headlights swivelled by the steering, though it is not\nmentioned on the Wikipedia page.\n\nThe wheelbase between the front and rear axles was 4.37 m and the weight was\nabout of 3 tons.\n\nOne of these cars is said to be in the Norwegian Museum of Science and\nIndustry in Oslo, though it appears not to be viewable on their website.\n\nLeft: Clarin-Mustad chassis: 1917\n\nYes, it can deal with three bricks.\n\nThe Clarin-Mustad shamelessly displays its front beam axle. Such axles were\ncommon in early cars because of their simplicity, but the disadvantages are\nthe lack of independent wheel movement and the high unsprung weight as the\nwhole axle is unsprung.\n\n##### Left: Open Mustad car: 1927  \n  \n---  \n  \n6 WHEELS: THE HISPANO-SUIZA H6A: 1922\n\nLeft: The Hispano-Suiza H6A: 1921\n\nBased on the standard H6 Hispano-Suiza, this unique car was built for\nConstantine I, the King of Greece. Regrettably he had to abdicate in 1922\nbefore taking delivery, and it was bought by the film director D. W. Griffith\nfor $35,000. It appeared in the 1933 film \"My Lips Betray\" and some war films.\nIt is now at the Forney Museum in Denver.\n\nThe car is believed to have been built in Barcelona, and the body designed and\nbuilt by Leon Rubay.\n\nThe H6 in general has a Wikipedia page.\n\n6 WHEELS??: THE FRENCH AMC SCHNEIDER P 16: 1925\n\nLeft: The AMC Schneider P16: 1925\n\nI don't think there is any rational way you could call this a 6-wheeled\nvehicle, but the very prominent nose-roller on this half-track relates to the\nFrench vehicles further on in this section. Of course once you let in tracked\nvehicles, you could have endless discussions as to whether you should count\njust the big wheels/sprockets at each end or all of the track roadwheels as\nwell. Let's not bother.\n\nThe P16 was developed in 1924 by Citro\ufffdn from the earlier Citro\ufffdn-K\ufffdgresse\nMod\ufffdle 1923. Both employed the K\ufffdgresse track, A K\ufffdgresse track uses rubber or\ncanvas in a continuous flexible belt rather than interlocking metal segments,\nas in conventional tracks. Adolphe K\ufffdgresse was a French military engineer.\n\nThis half-track was classified by the French as an armoured car rather than a\ntank.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE GAZ-21 6X6 PROTOTYPE: 1927\n\nLeft: The GAZ-21 6x6 prototype: 1927\n\nThe GAZ-21 6x6 was a Russian off-road prototype based on the GAZ-21 civilian\nsaloon car. Very little information is available.\n\nReferring to Wikipedia's List of GAZ vehicles we also find the GAZ-AAA - 6x4\n2-ton truck, produced from 1934 to 1943. It was a three axle version of the\nGAZ-AA.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE MERCEDES-BENZ G4 W31: 1934\n\nLeft: The Mercedes-Benz G4: 1934\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz G4 Type-W31 was a six-wheeled staff/command car built for\nthe Wehrmacht in 1934, designed to cope with off-road conditions. Only 57 were\nbuilt, of which only three completely original specimens are known to exist,\none of them belonging to the Spanish royal family.\n\nAll versions had eight-cylinder inline engine, driving the rear four wheels\nthrough self-locking differentials. The rear wheels were attached to two rigid\naxles suspended by semi-elliptic leaf springs. The first three years of\nproduction had 5018 cc engines delivering 100 HP. Later engine capacity was\nincreased to 5252 cc and then 5401 cc.\n\nThis car has a Wikipedia page.\n\nThanks to John Bevan for drawing this car to my attention.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE LORRAINE MILITARY VEHICLES: 1931/34\n\nLeft: Lorraine-Dietrich VLTT 72: 1931\n\nIt should be simple enough to say how many wheels a vehicle has; and then you\ncome across something like this. Does this count as six wheels or eight?\n\nThis vehicle is a VLTT (Voiture de Liason Tout Terraine) Lorraine 72, built\nunder licence from Tatra by Lorraine-Dietrich for the French forces. Images of\nthis vehicle and others with the same chin-mounted axle are not hard to find\nif you know what you are looking for, but nonetheless none of the sources\nexamined by the Museum staff even mention the very obvious extra wheels. It\nappears the idea is to make crossing ditches easier, as the extra wheels would\nhelp the front of the car to rise up the far side of the ditch.\n\nPresumably the two chin wheels were not powered, as they have no tread on;\nthey are purely to stop the vehicle burying its nose in the ground. There also\nappears to be no room under the extended starting-handle for any drive\nmechanism.\n\nWe have met the Lorraine-Dietrich company before, making six-wheeled lorries.\nSee 1908 above.\n\nLeft: Lorraine-Dietrich VLTT 72: 1931\n\nAt least one VLTT 72 has been preserved; location and date of photo not\ncurrently known.\n\nLeft: Lorraine-Dietrich VLTT 72: 1931\n\nThe rear of the preserved VLTT 72.\n\nLeft: Lorraine-Dietrich VDP 24: 1934\n\nThis vehicle, a fast troop transporter, was also built under licence from\nTatra. Testing began in 1934 and the VDP 24 was issued to the services in\n1937.\n\nNow there are four wheels on the chin axle, much more heavily constructed. So\nis that six wheels or ten?\n\nHere the chin wheels are treaded. It is not currently known if they were\npowered.\n\nThe weight was 3.78 tonnes loaded and 2.72 tonnes empty. Length was 4.84m and\nheight 2.08m. Ithad a four-cylinder engine of 4710 cc giving 55 HP and a\nmaximum speed of 65 km/hr. It could carry ten men in total. It had no built-in\narmament but two hatches in the roof allowed for possible mounting of AA guns.\n\nVDP srands for 'Voiture de Dragons Port\ufffds' which Google translate renders as\n'Car of dragons worn'; this is unhelpful. I think it means 'car for mechanised\ndragoons'.\n\nLeft: Lorraine-Dietrich 28: 1938\n\nThe Lorraine 28 radio truck was a variation on the VDP 24. Here is one taking\npart in a parade in Paris in the ominous year of 1938. Note white-wall tyres\non both the big and the little wheels.\n\nAn inherent problem with this idea is the need to carry around two sizes of\nspare wheel.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE SKODA 903 1936\n\nLeft: Skoda 903: 1936\n\nThis military vehicle, the Skoda 903 (page in Czech) was developed from the\nSkoda Superb. (1934-1949) for the Czech Army. Three were built initially; a\nlater version was built in 1939, totalling 42 vehicles..\n\nThe Skoda plant at Mlad\ufffd Boleslav is the largest production plant in the Czech\nRepublic.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE GAZ-AAAA Prototype: 1936\n\nLeft: GAZ-AAAA prototype: 1936\n\nThis Russian military prototype, the GAZ-AAAA, had six normal wheels plus two\nmore just behind the front pair. Images of this vehicle are very rare, but\nthere is a YouTube video that shows the GAZ-AAAA in action for a few seconds\naround 38:35, and this image is taken from there.\n\nPresumably the extra two wheels are spares; those carried on the middle and\nheavy Einheits-PKW did double-duty as while they did not normally contact the\nroad, they stopped the vehicle grounding on humps. These extra wheels are\nclose behind the front pair and it is hard to see how they could have\nfulfilled an anti-grounding function.\n\nReferring to Wikipedia's List of GAZ vehicles it appears that only one\nprototype was built.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE LAFFLY S35T ARTILLERY TRACTOR: 1937\n\nLeft: Laffly S35T 1937\n\nThis Laffly S35T artillery tractor also challenges definition. Do you call\nthis six wheels or ten?\n\nIt has six normal wheels, two little wheels on the chin like the Lorrain\nvehicles- plus another two little wheels between the front and middle main\naxles, presumably to stop the chassis grounding on bumps. The first vehicles\nwere delivered to the French army in 1937.\n\nAll six of the main wheels were driven, but only the front two steered.\n\nThe Laffly Company, founded in 1912, were major manufacturers of of heavy\nvehicles like trucks and buses in the 1920s and 1930s. Laffly made other\nmilitary vehicles with one or two extra little-wheel axles, such as the S15\nand the W15 TCC.\n\nLeft: Laffly S35T 1937\n\nThis picture of a Laffly S35T demonstrates that there were four wheels on the\nchin axle. So, do you call this six wheels or twelve? I am assuming the axle\nunder the cab carries only two little wheels because of restricted space. The\nlittle wheels had no suspension, but were rigidly attached.\n\nThis Laffly S35T is still in the hands of the French- note the caps on the\nmen. After the fall of France they were used by the Germans.\n\nThe main wheels are here fitted with snow chains. Since it's not winter (the\nmen are in their shirt-sleeves) I wonder if there some traction problems.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE VAUXHALL VILLIERS: 1938\n\nAnother approach to putting six wheels on your car is double tyres on the rear\naxle. The Vauxhall Villiers racing car had a 3000cc 300 HP supercharged\nengine, and dual rear wheels were tried by driver and entrepreneur Raymond\nMays in the hope of better traction in hill-climb races.\n\nLeft: The Vauxhall Villiers: 1938\n\nThe Vauxhall Villiers was sucessful at hill-climbing and sprint races, but it\nwas known to be a very tricky car to handle. Here Raymond Mays grimly clutches\nthe steering wheel.\n\nYou could argue all day if this really counts as six wheels rather than four\nwheels, but let's not.\n\nWhy anyone thought that holding up a grimy sheet behind the car would make a\nbetter picture is unknown.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE PAT CLANCY SPECIAL: 1948\n\nLeft: The Pat Clancy Special: 1948\n\nThis six-wheeled car was built to compete in the Indianapolis 500. The Clancy\nSpecial made its first appearance in the race in 1948, driven by Billy DeVore;\nit qualified 21st and finished 12th, 10 laps behind the winner but\nunquestionably a brave effort for an unconventional car.\n\nIn May 1949 it raced at the Indy 500 again, but retired after 65 laps with a\nbroken driveshaft. It was then converted to a four-wheeler.\n\nPat Clancy was a Memphis trucking fleet operator. His thinking was that since\ndual rear axles worked well on heavy trucks, they would also work well on\nracing cars.\n\nLeft: The Pat Clancy Special replica: build date unknown\n\nThis is a replica of the six-wheeled Clancy car, built by A J Watson. It has\nan Offenhauser engine.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE HANNIBAL TWIN-8: 1964\n\nLeft: The Hannibal Twin-8: 1964\n\nThis is Professor Fate's Hannibal Twin-8 car from the 1965 movie The Great\nRace. Jack Lemmon played the evil Professor Fate, opposite good guy Tony\nCurtis. (I saw it when it came out and I remember it as a good film) Sources\ndiffer as to whether three, five, or six were built, which is at least two\nmore than some of the machines in this gallery. However it seems likely that\nonly two of the cars were fully functional.\n\nUnusual features are that the bodywork really can be raised 9 feet above the\nchassis by hydraulic rams, and there was a fully functional smoke screen\ngenerator. However, the retractable brass cannon pointing out of the front is\nnot likely to fire anything other than a small pyrotechnic, and the nose that\ncould be made to glow red-hot (for melting snow drifts) was just a lighting\neffect.\n\nThis machine is worth studying, because it was rather more than just a movie\nprop. The Hannibal Twin-8's were custom built by Warner Bros from the ground\nup at a cost of $150,000 in 1965 money, which was about three times what a\nhouse went for back then. (It is not currently clear if that was the cost each\nor for the three; I suspect the latter)\n\nPower is from a Corvair flat-6 with a 3-speed manual gearbox; all four of the\nrear wheels are powered by a chain drive. The Hannibal Twin-8 remains in its\noriginal and un-restored condition just as it was last used on the movie set.\nIt is still fully operational, and it actually runs and drives. It even has a\n1965 assigned VIN and could be titled, registered and driven over the road.\n\nThe exact significance of the name is obscure. I seem to recall that the\nfictional car was supposed to have twin engnes, but attempts by the Museum\nstaff to confirm this have so far failed. As for the '8' surely they didn't\nmean twin V8 engines?\n\nThere is a video of Jack Lemmon extolling the features of the Hannibal Twin-8\non YouTube. The car appears at 0:40.\n\nLeft: The Hannibal Twin-8: 1964\n\nDemonstrating the Hannibal Twin-8's ability to rise above things.

After much\ntesting, Tyrrell decided to build two more 6-wheel cars to race in the 1976\nseason.\n\nThe idea behind the P34 was the use of front tyres that would fit in with the\nstreamlining. This would have two effects; this would be to lower overall drag\nand also provide smoother airflow to the rear wing. The wheels were only 10\ninches (250 mm) in diameter, and because of the small contact patch with the\nroad, four were required to give good cornering.\n\nLeft: Tyrell P34 driven by Depailler: 1976\n\nThe high point of the P34 story was the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix; Jody\nScheckter and Patrick Depailler finished first and second in their P34's.\nScheckter remains the only driver ever to win a race in a six-wheeled car.\n\nHowever various handling problems emerged and Tyrell's design for the 1978\nseason had four wheels. One P34 has survived and is often seen at historic\nracing events.\n\nLooks like daylight under that rear wheel.\n\nThere is a Wikipedia page for the P34.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE PANTHER SIX: 1977\n\nThis Six was built by the retro-sportscar manufacturer Panther, owned by\nRobert Jankel. Top speed was claimed at 200 mph, but Panther went bankrupt\nbefore any were sold.\n\nLeft: The Panther Six: 1977\n\nThe Panther Six is mid-engined with a 8.2 litre Cadillac V8 powerplant with\ntwin turbochargers. Only two cars were built, one white and one in black, and\nboth are known to still be in existence. The rear wheels are fitted with\n265/50 VR16 tyres, and the two pairs of steering front wheels with 205/40 VR13\ntyres. In the tyre codes the 16 and the 13 give the diameter of the wheel rim;\nit is therefore necessary to carry around two spare wheels of different sizes.\n\nThe Panther Six has a Wikipedia page.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE WOLFRACE SONIC: 1981\n\nLeft: The Wolfrace Sonic: 1981\n\nThis remarkable vehicle was built by Wolfrace to promote their alloy wheels.\nAnd what better way to do that than produce a car with more wheels than\nnormal?\n\nIt was powered by two Rover V8 engines, apparently controlled by a throttle-\nby-wire system. There was a spaceframe chassis, and rear-wheel drive through a\nJaguar rear-axle and differential. Despite the immense length of the\nBatmobile-style body, it was only a two seater. It was designed by Nick Butler\nand was a big budget project costing about \ufffd100,000.\n\nOn the 2nd of March 2015 the Sonic was sold on Ebay for \ufffd18,100 to an unknown\nbuyer.\n\nI am glad to report that Wolfrace are alive and well.\n\n6/8 WHEELS: THE CHRYSLER VOYAGER III: 1989\n\nLeft: The Chrysler Voyager III concept car: 1989\n\nThe idea here was to combine a small car suitable for solo commuting with a\nbig van that could haul the whole family around on vacations. It was shown at\nthe 1990 North American Auto Show.\n\nThe front car detached and ran on four wheels; it had seating for three in\nindividual bucket seats, arranged in a single row. (which surely must have\nmade the 'small car' rather wide) It was powered by a three-cylinder engine\nfuelled by propane and driving the front wheels.\n\nThe detachable rear section provided seating for eight more passengers, making\n11 occupants in all. It was to be powered an independent 2.2 litre four-\ncylinder engine, with the two engines were linked electronically. For maximum\nfuel economy, use of the rear engine was intended to be optional when the\nsegments were joined, but it is hard to believe a three-cylinder engine could\nsafely move the combination. When both engines were in use the two-engine\nconfiguration gave the Voyager all-wheel drive traction, so presumably both\nrear axles were driven.\n\nYou are probably wondering what happens to the rear wheels of the front unit;\nthey retracted underneath the Voyager III when the two halves were joined,\nwith aerodynamic skirts covering the open wheel wells. So... is that four\nwheels, six wheels, or eight wheels?\n\nAll of this was obviously heavy and expensive to manufacture, and had the\ncrippling snag that it would certainly have been cheaper to buy a small car\nand a big van separately; having two complete vehicles is clearly far more\nflexible.\n\nLeft: The Chrysler Voyager III concept car: 1989\n\nThis is the small-car section, with its rear wheels in action. It was powered\nby a three-cylinder engine running on propane. The wheelbase of the fully-\nassembled Voyager III was 122 inches, and the overall length 199 inches.\n\nThere is a Wikipedia page, where the car is referred to as 'the Plymouth\nVoyager 3'.\n\nThe car is referred to as the 'worst concept car of all time' here. I'm not\narguing.\n\n6 WHEELS: THE COVINI C6W: 2004\n\nThe Covini is a The Covini C6W is a six-wheeled Italian sports coup\ufffd. It is\nclaimed that it was directly inspired by the 1976 Tyrrell P34 above.\n\nLeft: The Covini C6W: 2004\n\nIn 2004 the C6W was first shown in prototype form. Small-scale production\nbegan in 2005 at the rate of 6-8 cars per year, and is believed to be still\ncontinuing. The car has 4200 cc 8-cylinder engine mounted at the rear and a\nclaimed top speed of 186 mph. The transmission is a 6-speed manual box.\n\n6 WHEELS: FAB-1: 2013\n\nLady Penelope was the posh piece of tottie in the Thunderbirds TV show. She\ndrove around in a shocking-pink Rolls-Royce with six wheels, usually\nchaffeured by Parker, a reformed burglar.\n\nLeft: Lady Penelope's FAB-1: 2013\n\nThere were various versions of FAB-1; this late version is at a show in Toykyo\nin 2013. Note Parker driving and Lady Penelope in the back.\n\nIn case you're wondering, 'Fab!' short for 'Fabulous!' was a common\nexclamation in the Swinging Sixties.\n\n### 7 WHEELS\n\nLeft: Car with one axle supported by a four-wheel truck: date unknown\n\nIt has taken a long time, but at last we have what can fairly be called a\nseven-wheeled car. Not surprisingly the man looks rather thoughtful. One hopes\nhe was not expected to do any rear-wheel steering.\n\nThe car is left-hand drive so this is presumably somewhere in Europe, in a\nplace where traffic regulations are not taken too seriously. Obviously it is\nfront-wheel drive as well. Stu Riegel says it is a Lada Oka and it appears to\nhave Russian plates.\n\nThe Oka was a reasonable cheap car, except that it was famously uncrashworthy.\nIt was nicknamed \"The capsule of death\". In a crash test, done by by the\nRussian ARCAP safety assessment program, the car received a 0 stars rating out\nof a possible 4.\n\nLeft: Seven-wheeled vehicle in Indonesia: date unknown\n\nIf you are unconvinced by the example above, here is a vehicle that has all\nseven wheels permanently attached. There are two wheels on the far side of the\nvehicle and five wheels on this side. The engine can be seen above and to the\nleft of the rear wheel, and below the green frame. Note the petrol can.\n\nGood to note that they are all wearing helmets.\n\nIdiosyncratic modifications are common in Indonesia.\n\n### 8 WHEELS\n\n8 WHEELS: THE OCTOAUTO: 1910\n\nLeft: A magnificent photograph of the Reeves Octo-Auto: 1910\n\nThe Reeves Octo-Auto was a 1910 Overland modified by Milton Reeves. It had a\n40 HP engine and was more than 20 feet long, carrying four passengers. It was\na commercial failure.\n\nUnfortunately this picture reveals nothing about how the suspension was\narranged.\n\nLeft: The Reeves Octo-Auto: 1910\n\nThis is not much more informative about the suspension, though we can see a\nconventional axle for the front two wheels.\n\nClearly taken at the same time as the photograph above.\n\nLeft: The Reeves Octo-Auto: 1910\n\nThis suggests that the front axle was simply held by two struts running\nbackwards. (see left front wheel)\n\nLeft: The Reeves Octo-Auto: 1910\n\nThe ad copy claims 'blowouts practically eliminated', though I would have\nthought that having twice as many tyres could only increase your chance of\npicking up a nail.\n\nLeft: The Reeves Octo-Auto: 1910\n\nAnother picture of the Octo-Auto at an unknown location.\n\n8 WHEELS: MERCEDES-BENX PERSONNEL CARRIER\n\nLeft: Mercedes-Benz eight-wheeler: 1927\n\nThe MTw 1 amphibous personnel carrier from Mercedes-Benz. All eight wheels\nwere driven, and it looks as though both front and back wheels were steerable.\nThis is a test chassis from 1927/28.\n\n8 WHEELS: MAGIRUS PERSONNEL CARRIER\n\nLeft: Magirus ARW eight-wheeler: 1927\n\nThis vehicle was designed to the same spec as the Mercedes above; it was\namphibous. All eight wheels were driven, and both front and back wheels were\nsteerable. There were once again driving positions at both front and back to\nfacilitate rapid retreats.\n\nIt never went into mass production as it was too expensive to build.\n\n8 WHEELS: THE RIMMEK CAR\n\nLeft: The Rimmek eight-wheeler in Berlin: 1935\n\nIn 1935 German engineer Gotthard Rimmek patented his first eight-wheeled\nmodel. The first prototype was a converted Brennabor car in 1925.\n\nThis was followed by a more sophisticated conversion of a German Adler\nDiplomat, a big six-cylinder 3-litre saloon introduced in 1934. The conversion\nboasted 'oscillation parallelograms in a progressive suspension\" and when I\nfind what that means I'll let you know.\n\nThose steering arms look a bit flimsy...\n\nLeft: The Rimmek eight-wheeler in Berlin: 1935\n\nRimmek applied for a German patent in March 1926, and patent DE452836C\n'Kraftfahrzeug mit zwei vorn und hinten angeordneten abgefederten\nRadachsenpaaren' was granted in November 1927. The title just means 'Motor\nvehicle with two front and rear sprung pairs of wheel axles' which tells us\nnothing more.\n\nApart from this no further history of the Rimmek cars has been discovered by\nthe Museum Staff.\n\nLeft: The Rimmek eight-wheeler: Magazine article\n\nThis looks as though it came from Popular Mechanics, or a similiar\npublication.\n\nLeft: The Rimmek eight-wheeler in Siemensstadt, Berlin: 1935?\n\nThe location is the intersection of Goebelstra\ufffde and Quellweg in Siemensstadt,\nin the north-west of Berlin. The area is called Siemensstadt as it was\npurpose-built housing for the employees of the Siemens electrics works. As for\nGoebelstra\ufffde it is named after the inventor Heinrich Goebel.\n\nThings have not changed much there; see Google streetview.\n\nFor some reason the photograph was taken on the tilt.\n\nThis remarkable piece of geographical detective work was done by Bernd F, to\nwhom much thanks\n\nLeft: The Rimmek eight-wheeler as reported in an Australian newspaper: 1935\n\nThe report claims that \"...most road shocks in motoring are caused by rebounds\nfrom the bumps as the wheels drop into potholes, these are almost\neliminated... as one wheel passes over the pothole, its neighbour is still on\nlevel ground, holding the car on its straight, smooth passage.\"\n\nI appreciate that road-building standards in Australia in 1935 may have been\ndifferent from what they are now, but I am not wholly convinced this is an\naccurate description of car suspension dynamics. It does however seem to give\nsome insight into what Rimmek was aiming at.\n\nHowever this is contradicted by the magazine piece just above, which suggests\nthat improved traction in mud and sand was the aim.\n\nFrom the Northern Times (Carnarvon, WA) for 18 Sept 1935\n\n8 WHEELS: THE T-13 HORNET B TRACKLESS TANK: 1940\n\nLeft: The T-13 Hornet B Trackless Tank: 1940\n\nThe T-13 Hornet B was a heavy eight-wheel armored car/tank, developed in the\nlate 30's as a private venture by the Trackless Tank Corporation. The rear six\nwheels were driven, giving an 8\ufffd6 format. The Hornet weighed 7.5 tons with a\nturret fitted. The prototype (seen here) did not have the turret mounted, just\na small machine-gun position.\n\nThe Hornet was trialled by the USA, British and Australian armed forces, but\nonly a few were sold.\n\nMany heavy armoured cars had eight wheels. Examples are the German 8-Wheeled\nSd.Kfz.232 and the Panhard EBR 75.\n\nThere is more information here. There does not appear to be a Wikipedia page.\n\n8 WHEELS: THE RAIL TRUCK: 19??\n\nLeft: The rail truck: 19??\n\nThis vehicle is included here because it has many odd features. Whether it was\nintended for rail and road use, or just rail, is hard to determine. It is\ncertainly sitting on tracks, but it looks as though it has tyres inside the\nrailway wheels. The railway wheels seem to have outside flanges, which is not\nhow railways usually work, as it makes constructing points etc much more\ndifficult.\n\nThe two rear axles are coupled with a rod exactly as in steam engine practice.\nThe two front axles with the small wheels look rather like a locomotive bogie,\nbut there seems very little room for such a bogie to swivel. How would it\nsteer when on the road?\n\nIt says \"RAIL TRUCK\" on the door but no other text is legible. The location is\nprobably the USA, judging by the transformer on a pole in the centre\nbackground.\n\nNothing is known about the machine; a reverse image search yields no info. If\nanyone knows anything about this odd machine, I will be very glad to hear it.\n\n8 WHEELS: ADVERTISING FANTASY: 1950s\n\nLeft: Advert for Goodyear Super Cushion tyres: 1950s?\n\nThis wholly imaginary vehicle is designed to emphasise how much testing went\ninto the tyres' development.\n\nI wrote here: 'Despite diligent googling of 'super cushion tyre company' no\ntrace of a 1950's company has been found.' The next day several emails arrived\npointing out that Super Cushion was not a tyre company, but a brand of bias-\nply tyre sold by Goodyear from the mid-late 1950s to the early 1960s.\n\nHowever you can buy super cushion tyres today, though interestingly they are\nsolid tyres for earth-moving equipment.\n\nThanks to Yukisdad for the image, and to all my Super Cushion correspondents.\n\n8 WHEELS: THE HOME-BUILT OCTO-ROD: 1961\n\nLeft: The Octo-rod eight-wheeled car: 1961\n\nThis vehicle has been identified by Paul Dunlop as the Octo-rod, built by\nEnoch Johnson of Red Wing, Minnesota, between 1946 and 1961.\n\nOne can only speculate as to why the driver (presumably Mr Johnson) is looking\nso grim.\n\nThe design of the wheels suggest Mercedes parts may have been involved.\n\nThanks to Paul Dunlop for identifying this vehicle.\n\nLeft: The Octo-rod eight-wheeled car: 1961\n\nThe Octo-rod was powered by a 1951 Dodge Red Ram Hemi V8 engine of 5.4 Litres,\ndeveloping 180 HP. No other mechanical details are known; there's no doubt\nthat all four front wheels steered but it is not known if both rear axles were\ndriven.\n\nLeft: The Octo-rod eight-wheeled car: 1961\n\nThe Octo-rod 8-wheel car is today on display at the Pioneer Auto Museum in\nMurdo, South Dakota.\n\nMany more pictures of the Octo-rod can be see here. The car was featured in\nHot Rod magazine at some point.\n\n8 WHEELS: THE ELIICA: 2004\n\nThe Eliica was and is (the project appears to be in continuous development)\nelectric car developed by Keio University in Japan, first shown in 2004. It\nuses lithium-ion batteries. It is allegedly faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo.\nDespite its large size it only seats four people.\n\nLeft: The Eliica: 2004\n\nThe Eliica has eight wheels, supposedly to improve traction. They are smaller\nthan normal car wheels, allowing the vehicles to be closer to the ground for\nbetter aerodynamics and stability. Each of the eight wheels is driven by a 60\nkW (80 hp) electric motor, giving 480 kW (640 hp) eight wheel drive in total,\nwith regenerative braking to recover energy. The four front wheels steer. Each\nof the eight wheels has a disc brake.\n\nEight-wheel drive might in theory allow the Eliica to deal with all kinds of\nroad surfaces, but the low ground clearance suggests that off-road operation\nis not a sensible option. Smooth acceleration of about 0.8 g is claimed.\n\nThe Eliica is a development of the earlier KAZ (Keio Advanced Zero-emission\nvehicle), which was a 6.7 m (22 ft) limousine-sized 8-wheel 8-person electric\nvehicle prototype announced in 2003.\n\nEIGHT-WHEELED TRACTORS\n\nLeft: Ford eight-wheeled tractor\n\nIf you're dealing with soft soil, one solution is a four-wheel-drive tractor\nwith two tyres on each axle. This is a Ford\n\nLeft: Eight-wheeled tractor by International\n\nNote that the wheels here are spaced about a foot apart, presumably to spread\nthe weight out as much as possible.\n\n8 WHEELS: THE OSHKOSH M1070 TRACTOR: 1992\n\nLeft: Oshkosh eight-wheeled tractor\n\nThis tractor unit is in service with the US and British Armies, usually\nhauling tank-transporter trailers.\n\nBoth front and the rearmost axle are powered and steer. Production commenced\nin 1992. The M1070 has a Wikipedia page.\n\n### 9 WHEELS\n\nThe search for a nine-wheeled vehicle is over.\n\nLeft: The Nonacycle: 2001\n\nThis semi-recumbent 'bicycle' was built by Rick Unger in Autumn 2001, to be\nauctioned off at a Patchwork Central Holiday Sale in November 2001. However,\nthe reserve price of $500 was not met. The frame was built up from twenty feet\nof exhaust pipe.\n\nAt the front there are four small wheels on each side, plus one normal one at\nthe back, making nine. Steering is by the two levers. It is not practical\ntransport; the tiny wheels will be stopped by the smallest obstruction, and\nsince they appear to have solid tyres, it's going to be a rough ride.\n\nLeft: The Nonacycle: 2001\n\nCall me picky, but I don't see any sign of brakes here. Maybe that's why it\ndidn't sell.\n\nNo sign of gears either.\n\n### 10 WHEELS\n\n10 WHEELS: THE MILLES-PATTES\n\nNo problem at all. This car- and I submit it is more a car than anything else-\nwas built by Michelin in 1972, when they were major shareholders of the\nCitroen company. It is officially called the Citroen DS PLR break, where PLR\nstands for Poids Lourd Rapide meaning heavy fast truck. It was built as a way\nof safely testing of truck tyres at speed on a real road. Unofficially it is\nknown as the mille pattes or 'thousand paws', which is the French word for\ncentipede, not, as you might expect, millipede. I feel obliged to point out\nthat no millipede has as many as 1000 feet; the record is up to 750, for\nIllacme plenipes.\n\nLeft: The mille pattes tyre-testing car: 1972\n\nThe mille pattes has four wheels at the front, and six wheels at the back. Why\nso many? Because the vehicle was loaded down with lead until it weighed 9.5\ntons; this was so that realistic truck loadings could be placed on the tyre\nunder test. A strong metal casing retained tyre fragments if it disintegrated,\nand the ten other wheels allowed control to be maintained if that happened. In\nfact it was only ever used on a closed test circuit.\n\nThe car used as many standard parts as possible, and so bears a distinct\nresemblance to a Citroen DS. The tyre to be tested was installed in the centre\nof the car, shown open in this picture.\n\nIt is powered by two 454 Big-Block Chevrolet engines, one of which drove the\nrear six wheels, and the other the tyre under test. Top speed is over 110 mph.\n\nThe mille pattes has a Wikipedia page.\n\nLeft: The mille pattes tyre-testing car: 1972\n\nHere one of the side-panels has been removed, showing the enclosure for the\ntyre under test.\n\nYou can learn more about this wonderful vehicle here.\n\nThere is a video on YouTube.\n\nDie cast models were made in 1972 and sometimes surface on Ebay.\n\nThe mille pattes is no longer used for tyre testing but remains in use as a\npromotional vehicle. It spends most of its time at the Michelin Museum in\nClermont-Ferrand.\n\nMany thanks to Sean O'Brien for bringing this remarkable machine to my\nattention.\n\nLeft: The Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle: 1967\n\nThe Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle (SPV) is a fictional 10-wheeled attack and\npursuit vehicle that featured prominently in Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's\nscience-fiction television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. (1967)\nOnly the first, third and fifth axles were powered, and these carried larger\nwheels. The maximum speed was a rather unlikely 200 or 250 mph, depending on\nepisode. A notable feature was that the crew of two faced backwards (for\nbetter crash protection) and drove using a television screen and front-mounted\ncamera; this was an awkward decision as it had to be explained several times\nin the series.\n\nThe SPV was usually manned by Captain Blue and Captain Scarlet; Captain Blue\nwas a skilled SPV driver, but Captain Scarlet crashed several times.\nFortunately he was Indestructable.\n\nThe SPV has a Wikipedia page.\n\n10 WHEELS: THE 45-FOOT CADILLAC LIMOUSINE\n\nLeft: 10-wheeled 'Cadillac'.

The milles-pattes car has eleven\nwheels on the road when a truck tyre is installed for testing. In the YouTube\nvideo a test tyre is fitted.\n\n12 WHEELS: THE DESERT RENAULT MH\n\nLeft: The desert Renault MH car: 1923\n\nThe Renault MH was designed to cope with desert conditions, having three\naxles, each carrying four wheels, to give low ground pressure. It also had a\nlarge ground clearance. Only the rear two axles were driven. Note a spare\nwheel either side of the bonnet, and two more spare tyres on the roof. Renault\nwere doing things throughly.\n\nI think this is indisputably a 12-wheeled vehicle. It was a response to\nCitroen, who in 1922 sent out tracked vehicles to cross the Sahara. At the\ntime there were no railways joining north and southern Africa.\n\nIf you're wondering about the forward-facing louvres on the bonnet sides, they\nare to let air into the radiator, which in Renault cars of this era were\nbehind the engine.\n\nAt the end of 1923, the first mission was accomplished\ufffdan overland drive from\nTouggourt in Algeria to Tozeur in Tunisia in two days. In January 1924 the\nGradis-Estienne expedition linked Algeria to Niger.\n\n12 WHEELS: THE AUSTRIAN ADGZ\n\nLeft: The Austrian ADGZ armoured car: 1934\n\nThe ADGZ was a heavy armoured car developed by the Austrian firm of Steyr. It\nwas intended for 'internal security duties' which no doubt covered a multitude\nof sins. A total of 27 were built between 1935 and 1937; after the 1938\nAnschluss they were taken over by the Germans.\n\nThis vehicle caught the attention of the Museum Staff because of the unusual\nconfiguration with the two middle axles close together. Investigation showed\nthat in fact it had not eight wheels, as it first appeared, but twelve, as the\ntwo middle axles each carried four wheels. I'm certainly prepared to accept\nthis as a twelve-wheeled car.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the ADGZ, which it shared with the Swedish FM29\narmoured car of 1932, was that it was designed with rapid retreat in mind. The\nbody was essentially symmetric with a driver, headlights, and an M34 machine\ngun at each end, with a dual transmission so that the drivers could rapidly\nswitch roles. The engine was at the rear. The turret carried a 20mm KwK 35\nL/45 autocannon.\n\nLeft: An ADGZ armoured car in the Sudetenland: 1938\n\nHere it is just possible to make out the second wheel on one of the middle\naxles. The turret had a double hatch on top, which could be fully opened, as\nshown here.\n\nThe Sudetenland was the northern, southern, and western areas of what was then\nCzechoslovakia. It was annexed by Germany in 1938\n\n12 WHEELS: THE MAZ-547 MISSILE TRANSPORTER\n\nLeft: 12-wheeled Russian missile transporter: 2009\n\nThe MAZ-547 transporter is a six-axle version of the MAZ-7310 8x8 artillery\ntractor, designed to carry the RSD-10 Pioneer medium-range missile.\n\n14 WHEELS: MULTI-RIDER DELIVERY BIKE\n\nLeft: 14-wheeled delivery bike: date unknown\n\nAs far as I can tell there are seven wheels at the back as well, but it's not\nvery clear. Nothing known at present. And yes, it is stretching the definition\nof a car.\n\nGoogle reverse image search yields nothing.\n\n16 WHEELS: RUSSIAN MISSILE TRANSPORTER\n\nLeft: Russian 16-wheel missile transporter: Moscow Parade rehearsal 2012\n\nIt has only just occurred to me that missile transporters have a lot of\nwheels. This is a Russian MZKT-79221 transporter. It is powered by a 800HP V12\ndiesel engine.\n\nIt carries a RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM.\n\n18 WHEELS: THE 72-FOOT CADILLAC LIMOUSINE\n\nLeft: Jay Ohrberg 18-wheel Cadillac: date unknown\n\nHere we have six front wheels, and twelve rear wheels, for a meritorious total\nof eighteen. You may be wondering why twelve wheels are required to support\nthe rear of the car; it's because that's where the swimming pool is.\n\nBuilt by Jay Ohrberg. (see below) Unfortunately no technical details are\ncurrently available.\n\n24 WHEELS: THE AMERICAN DREAM LIMOUSINE\n\nJay Ohrberg of Burbank, California, is an American constructor of special\ncars, including several Batmobiles and KITT from Knight Rider. This 100-foot\nvehicle is accepted by the Guinness book of Records as the world's longest\ncar.\n\nLeft: The American Dream 24-wheel car: 1986\n\nHere we have six front wheels, eight middle wheels, and ten rear wheels, for a\ngrand total of 24 wheels.\n\nThis is not photoshopping. Many more pictures of the American Dream can be\nseen at Jay Ohrberg's website. There is a helipad at the rear of the limo,\nover the rear wheels, with a helicopter sitting on it.\n\nThe car deteriorated in storage for some time.\n\nJay Ohrberg has a Wikipedia page.\n\nI asked Mr Ohrberg by email for permission to post a pic or two, but have had\nno answer so far.\n\n26 WHEELS: THE AMERICAN DREAM LIMOUSINE\n\nI am glad to report that the American Dream has been fully restored. An\narticle in topspeed.com says several times that wheels have been added to make\na total of 26, buy this cannot be seen in contemporary photographs.\n\nLeft: The American Dream 24-wheel car: 1986\n\nHere we still seem to have six front wheels, eight middle wheels, and ten rear\nwheels, for total of 24 wheels. There are only three axles at the front, there\nis not another wheel hidden behind the golf cart. Perhaps the answer is that\none axle now has 4 wheels on it.\n\nThe car is now officially the longest car in the world. At the right (rear)\ncan be seen the helipad, the swimming pool, and the miniature golf course.\n\n30 WHEELS: COZAD TRACTOR & TRAILER\n\nLeft: Cozad 9-axle-stretch-deck-booster-trailer: 2022\n\nThis tractor-trailer combination is designed to move big loads weighing up to\n80-85 tons. There are two single wheels at the front of the tractor and two\naxles carrying a total of 8 wheels at the rear. The trailer has six axles,\neach carrying four wheels; on each side there are two wheels outside the\nchassis side-member and two inside. That adds up to 30 wheels\n\nThere are more pictures and technical drawings at the Cozad website.\n\n40 WHEELS: M1000 TRAILER\n\nLeft: M1000 trailer: 2022\n\nThe M1000 has 40 wheels (215/75R 17.5 tires) on five axles, with four wheels\non each side of of each axle. Each axle has hydraulic suspension providing a\n254 mm travel. The M1000 is weighs 22,882 kg. Payload according to the US Army\nis 63,560 kg, though the manufacturer quotes 80,000 kg at reduced speeds.\n\nThe overall length is 15.8 m, deck length 10.58 m; deck width 3.05 m, or 3.66\nm for a wide deck version.\n\nThe M1000 is hauled by the M1070 8-wheel tractor\n\n72 WHEELS MINIMUM: THREE TRACTORS & A TRAILER\n\nLeft: Rotran Set headed by a Nicolas Tractomas Truck: South Africa 2015\n\nThis Abnormal Vehicle is a Rotran Set headed by a Nicolas Tractomas Truck, and\ntwo International Pacific tractors [Ex South African Railways] with a Girder\nBeam carried on two Multi Axle Nicolas Trailers.\n\nIf I've counted correctly, 38 wheels are visible in the picture, on one side.\nSo there must be at least 76 wheels when we include those on the other side.\nHowever most of the wheels will be at least double and may very well be\nfourfold as in the 30-wheeler shown above. If we assume all wheels are double\n(and none fourfold) except for the single steering wheels on the two\nInternational Pacific tractors, we get a total of 76 - 4 = 72 wheels.\nImpressive.\n\nNow all we have to do is decide if this train counts a 'one vehicle'.\n\nThis may not be the limit; there may be bigger trailers out there.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
