The restraining order, which Manhattan federal Judge Paul\nEngelmayer denied, was aimed at stopping Millennium from using a top-secret\ntrading strategy Jane Street says two ex-employees pilfered to make money for\nMillennium.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nIt was the first hearing over a lawsuit representing a clash of two of Wall\nStreet's most formidable and lucrative trading firms. In a heavily redacted\ncomplaint filed April 12, Jane Street accused former senior index options\ntrader Doug Schadewald and his direct report Daniel Spottiswood of taking\nhighly valuable trading IP with them when they left to join Millennium in\nFebruary. Most details about the trade were redacted. Even the country the\nstrategy focused on is highly confidential, according to Jane Street.\n\nAt Friday's hearing, Jane Street attorney Deborah Brown, a partner at Quinn\nEmanuel, argued that revealing the country would enable competitors to start\ndigging into the signals and hedging strategies and figure out the trade.\n\nOver the course of Friday's nearly two-hour hearing, however, it emerged that\nthe strategy revolved around short-term options trading in India. Lawyers also\nrevealed that the trade earned Jane Street $1 billion last year and was on\npace to earn even more for the firm this year.\n\n## Name of secret country inadvertently revealed\n\nJane Street claims the trade, its most profitable, is highly confidential\nintellectual property. The firm even sought to have the hearing closed to the\npublic, a motion Judge Engelmayer quickly dismissed.\n\nEngelmayer said he wasn't comfortable with the level of secrecy, calling the\npresumption of confidentiality \"way too broad.\" He specifically called out the\nredaction of the country where the trade takes place, allowing it to remain\nunnamed but suggesting the plaintiffs take a \"more realistic view\" of the\nstandard of public disclosure in US federal court.\n\nBrown argued that if more details emerge, the strategy, which Jane Street\nspent tens of millions of dollars building, \"could evaporate\" as new\ncompetitors pile in. But she also indicated that the strategy is related to\nshort-term options, telling the judge the market in question \"is not something\npeople invest in long-term, more like a day.\"\n\nOn multiple occasions attorneys for the defendants appeared to slip up and\nmention the trade is tied to \"India,\" apologizing afterward.\n\nAttorneys for Millennium as well as Schadewald and Spottiswood said the trade\nis not so secret, arguing that the media has written about it extensively in\nthe past year and that the government of the country overseeing the market has\nissued reports detailing the market's opportunities and inefficiencies.\n\n\"It's one of the largest if not the largest options trading markets in the\nworld,\" Dechert attorney Andrew Levander, who is representing Millennium,\nsaid.\n\nA March news report in The Wall Street Journal found options trading in India\nhas exploded, with 78% of all global equity options contracts tied to the\ncountry in 2023. More than 84 billion stock index options contracts were\ntraded in India last year \u2014 the vast majority short-term options \u2014 up 153%\nfrom 2022.\n\n\"In India, er, in this country \u2014 I apologize \u2014\" Levander started to in\nresponse to a question about why Jane Street's broker temporarily stopped\nprocessing its trade after Millennium entered the market. The defendants'\nattorneys argued that brokers in India have tighter margin restrictions than\nother markets.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"It's not unusual for brokers in India to hit margin limits,\" said Rollo\nBaker, a partner at Elsberg Baker & Maruri, who is representing Schadewald and\nSpottiswood. He referenced a news report from February that found 35% of the\nmarket's options trading is conducted by retail, or amateur, investors, while\nthe rest is handled by institutional investors \u2014 professionals like Jane\nStreet and Millennium.\n\n## A trade worth more than $1 billion\n\nJane Street is understandably antsy to keep its trade under wraps and out of\nthe grasp of competitors. The firm made $10.6 billion in net trading revenue\nlast year, according to bond issuance documents reported on by Bloomberg, and\n$4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe firm, which trades with its own capital instead of managing other\ninvestors' money like a hedge fund, began researching the trade in 2018 and\nspent tens of millions developing it in the succeeding years, reaching full\nmaturity in 2023 and 2024. It became its most successful strategy, producing\n$1 billion in profits in 2023, according to statements from the attorneys and\nJudge Engelmayer in court Friday.\n\nOther statements Friday suggest the trade was on pace for multiples of that\namount in 2024.\n\nJane Street worried about extinguishing the trade's viability, Brown said,\nintentionally leaving short-term profits on the table to maintain its long-\nterm viability. It endeavored to size its trades such that it avoided sending\nsignals to the rest of the market.\n\nBut the company's profits from the strategy plummeted in the month after the\ntraders joined Millennium, Jane Street says, falling 50% in March. The firm\nalleges the decline is attributable to the emergence of a new competitor \u2014\nMillennium \u2014 whereas previously they were aware of no other firm executing a\nsimilar strategy.\n\nSchadewald and Spottiswood were Jane Street's most profitable traders last\nyear, Baker said.\n\nJane Street is one of the rare Wall Street trading firms that doesn't impose\nnoncompetes on departing employees \u2014 which would require them to sit out\nmonths or years before joining a rival \u2014 instead relying on its\nconfidentiality and trade secret agreements. The firm claims to have never\npreviously sued a departing employee in its 24-year history.\n\nJane Street is not alleging the traders stole computer code or data \u2014 it's not\na formula or software, Brown said, but rather trading signals and techniques\nthat can be remembered in your head.\n\nAttorneys for Millennium and the traders say they breached no trade secrets,\narguing that external factors explain the drop in profit. Baker said a decline\nin volatility \u2014 a key factor in options trading \u2014 compared to prior months was\nto partially to blame. He also said that Millennium was trading at a fraction\nof the scale as Jane Street \u2014 50-times less exposure \u2014 noting that Jane Street\nmade $185 million during the relevant time period and Millennium made $4\nmillion.\n\nThe $185 million figure, if accurate, suggests that Jane Street's Indian\noptions strategy was on pace to generate multiple billions in 2024, even at\nthe decreased monthly figure.\n\nWho is ultimately right likely won't be decided until summer, when the parties\nindicated they'd be ready to go to trial.\n\nMillennium is free to continue trading in the meantime. Engelmayer denied the\ntemporary restraining order, saying Jane Street did not establish irreparable\nharm. Jane Street's claims are \"undeniably serious,\" Engelmayer said, adding\nthat the company has \"identified smoke but hasn't established a fire.\"\n\nJane Street may believe irreversible harm has already taken place, given its\ndesire to keep details of the trade secret, including the country it operates\nin.\n\nBut more disclosure about the trade seems inevitable as the firms head toward\ndiscovery.\n\nJudge Engelmayer asked for updated filings from the parties by mid-next week\nwith far fewer redactions.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Why Sam Bankman-Fried is facing up to 110 years in prison\n\nFinance\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
