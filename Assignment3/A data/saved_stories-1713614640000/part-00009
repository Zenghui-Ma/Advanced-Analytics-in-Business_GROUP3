(August 2019) (Learn how and when to\nremove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nAs presented by Hao Wang (1954, 1957), his basic machine B is an extremely\nsimple computational model equivalent to the Turing machine. It is \"the first\nformulation of a Turing-machine theory in terms of computer-like models\"\n(Minsky, 1967: 200). With only 4 sequential instructions it is very similar\nto, but even simpler than, the 7 sequential instructions of the Post\u2013Turing\nmachine. In the same paper, Wang introduced a variety of equivalent machines,\nincluding what he called the W-machine, which is the B-machine with an \"erase\"\ninstruction added to the instruction set.\n\n## Description[edit]\n\nAs defined by Wang (1954) the B-machine has at its command only 4\ninstructions:\n\n  * (1) \u2192 : Move tape-scanning head one tape square to the right (or move tape one square left), then continue to next instruction in numerical sequence;\n  * (2) \u2190 : Move tape-scanning head one tape square to the left (or move tape one square right), then continue to next instruction in numerical sequence;\n  * (3) * : In scanned tape-square print mark * then go to next instruction in numerical sequence;\n  * (4) Cn: Conditional \"transfer\" (jump, branch) to instruction \"n\": If scanned tape-square is marked then go to instruction \"n\" else (if scanned square is blank) continue to next instruction in numerical sequence.\n\nA sample of a simple B-machine instruction is his example (p. 65):\n\n    1\\. *, 2. \u2192, 3. C2, 4. \u2192, 5. \u2190\n\nHe rewrites this as a collection of ordered pairs:\n\n    { ( 1, * ), ( 2, \u2192 ), ( 3, C2 ), ( 4, \u2192 ), ( 5, \u2190 ) }\n\nWang's W-machine is simply the B-machine with the one additional instruction\n\n  * (5) E : In scanned tape-square erase the mark * (if there is one) then go to next instruction in numerical sequence.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Codd's cellular automaton\n  * Counter-machine model\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  * Hao Wang (1957), A Variant to Turing's Theory of Computing Machines, JACM (Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery) 4; 63\u201392.

In particular see p. 262ff (italics in original):\n\n    \n\n    \"We can now demonstrate the remarkable fact, first shown by Wang [1957], that for any Turing machine T there is an equivalent Turing machine T_N that never changes a once-written symbol! In fact, we will construct a two-symbol machine T_N that can only change blank squares on its tape to 1's but can not change a 1 back to a blank.\" Minsky then offers a proof of this.\n\nRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wang_B-\nmachine&oldid=1094645783\"\n\nCategory:\n\n  * Turing machine\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * Articles lacking in-text citations from August 2019\n  * All articles lacking in-text citations\n\n  * This page was last edited on 23 June 2022, at 19:14 (UTC).\n  * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0; additional terms may apply.
