Perhaps you thought to\nyourself, \u201cWow, this does that?!\u201d\n\nI asked as many people as I could what that thing was for them. Age, of\ncourse, had a lot to do with the range of replies I received. The older people\ntold me about pull-string \u201ctalking\u201d toys, reel-to-reel tape players, and the\nfamily\u2019s first color television. People my age recalled things that I, too,\nhad used from early on \u2014 gadgets like the Speak and Spell, the Sony Walkman,\nAtari consoles, calculator watches, and more. Younger people seemed to not\nunderstand the question, at least not in the same way those of us of\nGeneration X or prior did. I got answers, but they often came with\nexplanations like, \u201cI dunno...everything was technology...this was just my\nfavorite thing.\u201d And, at least in my observation, most of those favorite\nthings were much closer to the sort of personal device everyone has today.\nThings like the LeapFrog Leapster (a portable gaming system), the Sidekick (a\nmobile phone), and the iPod \u2014 all mentioned \u2014 not only have counterparts still\nin wide use today but were created at a time when personal computing was\nalready ubiquitous.\n\nPerhaps that is the key: there\u2019s a significant generational line dividing\nthose who came of age before the internet transformed what we mean by\n\u201cpersonal devices\u201d and those who came of age after. That we already knew. Its\nimpact on technological worldviews remains to be fully understood.\n\nMy younger brother, born a decade later than I was, mentioned an interesting\nobject. It was the Cybiko, a Russian-made PDA for kids. He recalled that,\nthough it looked cool and could run games and play music, the feature that\nastounded him was that it essentially generated a local social network,\nallowing users to wirelessly chat with one another at a range of up to 100\nmeters. It was like having a text-based walkie-talkie in your pocket.\n\nWhat a cool idea \u2014 especially at a time when a ten-year-old could have freely\ncommunicated over the internet or mobile network but whose parents would have\nwisely prevented it.\n\nI would have been over twenty years old when my brother received his Cybiko.\nBut it would have been just the sort of personal device I\u2019d have found\nfascinating then, and still do today.\n\nThere\u2019s something about the personal device that I have always found\nfascinating and now find to be almost mysterious. But to be personal it has to\nbe a certain kind of device \u2014 the kind that balances access to another world\nwith the kinds of limits and boundaries that make a thing private. That\nbalance is something I\u2019ve always been able to point to in particular objects \u2014\nthis has it, but that does not \u2014 but describing it on its own, as a set of\nrules or characteristics, has always eluded me. But, for me, a personal device\nis defined by this balance, not by virtue of being the thing in my pocket and\nnot the one in yours.\n\nI think this notion of a personal technology is deeply meaningful. So I\u2019d like\nto find a way to explain it.\n\nNearly everyone I asked returned the question \u2014 That was the gadget for me...\nSo, what was yours?\n\nI can point to my own origin-objects \u2014 gadgets like the Fisher Price Movie\nViewer, the Pocket Rocker, the Etch A Sketch Animator, or, from a bit later,\nthe Arion Hot-Watt II \u2014 and describe why they had that thing. Besides being\nquirky, niche products, they all let me enter another world that, at times,\nseemed both bigger and smaller than this one. It was as if that world was\noutside of this one, made accessible by the push of a button and, at the same\ntime, that it sprang into existence as a me-sized bubble universe, Population:\n1. This is the paradox of the personal device.\n\nThe tension between knowing that the world a personal device creates has\nboundaries defined by its code and materials and not knowing exactly what they\nare is one that, when kept in balance, activates the imagination. It allows\nfor exploration, both of the object and through the object.\n\nPeople of a certain age who remember spending hours exploring Hyrule, the\nworld of The Legend of Zelda, will immediately understand this feeling. You\ncould explore the world, and you could play the game. I\u2019m not sure I ever\ntired of exploring enough to actually play the game.\n\nThe most magical of personal devices are those which offer access to the\nexperience of infinitude without measuring it for you. The unknown is the\nstuff of imagination.\n\nThat is the opposite of our most common device-based experiences today.\nWhether you use a phone, tablet, laptop, or any other computer, the digital\n\u201cworld\u201d today is always defined by an acute awareness of measure. Of more. But\nmore is the easiest way to obstruct the imagination. Persistent input keeps\ncognition at its lower levels \u2014 maintaining attention, storing memory,\napplying perception, and processing language \u2014 without allowing a transition\nto thought and learning.\n\nThe best personal device supports thought \u2014 with it, within it, and most\nimportantly, within you. Carl Jung once wrote that \u201cin each of us there is\nanother whom we do not know.\u201d The purpose of introspection, for Jung, was to\nbecome acquainted with that person \u2014 to deepen our understanding of ourselves\nso that we may be more fully ourselves.\n\nWhat if technology had the same purpose?\n\nWhat if personal technology saw imagination \u2014 open, unresolved, interior, and\nsubjective as it is \u2014 not just as a byproduct of use but as a purpose for it;\nas equal to utility, communication, or entertainment?\n\n## Solutions to Complexity\n\nI have been thinking about these pages \u2193 for two decades.\n\nThey come from Bruce Mau\u2019s Massive Change, a text that \u2014 unlike so many other\nbooks about design, systems, technology, and human culture that speak loudly\nto their time and then never again \u2014 remains important. Has as much to say to\ntoday\u2019s world as it did nearly twenty years ago, if not more. Was prescient.\nIs prophetic.\n\nRead what Mau and those who comprised the Institute Without Boundaries had to\nsay here, and then remember that it was written twenty years ago \u2014 when the\nmost popular mobile phone was the Nokia 1100, Windows XP had just been\nreleased, the iTunes Store had opened for the very first time, and few people\nhad ever experienced mobile computing. It would take a few years until laptop\nsales would exceed desktop; a few more before smartphone sales would exceed\ncomputers. It was a different time.\n\n> \u201cThe interface: We need technological enhancements because the world is\n> complex. But sometimes the complexities we encounter are a result of the\n> technologies themselves. Good design augments human possibility and reduces\n> complexity...Think of the delight in experiencing finely crafted musical\n> instrument, paintbrushes, mountain bikes, cars. Now think about computers.\n> They too have incredible potential to augment human capacity. But to do it\n> well, our expertise about humans must at least match our knowledge of\n> engineering. The human must be balanced with the technological or else\n> invention becomes, as Henry David Thoreau said, \u2018an improved means to an\n> unimproved end.\u2019 The challenge is as great as the potential.\u201d\n\nThese words were a powerful prompt. They could have easily opened the pitch\nfor any number of devices of the time \u2014 either imaginary or in production.\nSteve Jobs could have cited them three years later, in between the refrain,\n\u201can iPod, a phone, an internet communicator\u201d. He could have pointed to these\npages when he said, \u201cAre you getting it? These are not three separate\ndevices!\u201d\n\nFrom the view of twenty years ago, the solution to complexity was complexity\ndressed up like simplicity. A better machine was one that replaced three and\nstill \u201cjust worked.\u201d Our expertise about humans suggested that we wanted to do\nmore with less and our knowledge of engineering was able to deliver that.\n\nBut twenty years of increasingly technological everyday life has me\nreinterpreting Mau\u2019s words on the interface.\n\nNow, when I read of the need for technological solutions to complexity, I\nthink less of gathering power at my fingertips and more about getting distance\nfrom it. When I think about the delight in experiencing a finely crafted\nobject, I think less about features and more about feel.\n\nWhen I read that passage, the words that once stood out \u2014 enhance, augment,\nengineering \u2014 recede, while others protrude with a new urgency: possibility,\nhuman, balance.\n\nIn hindsight, the smartphone tipped the scales in favor of technology. It did\nnot balance the human with the technological. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t really\nknow that until later, and truth be told, plenty aren\u2019t sure it\u2019s even so\ntoday. For me, however, it is so; the debate is no longer interesting. But an\neffort to continue the process of invention, continue to calibrate our balance\nof the human and the technological, continue to imagine what the things we\ncarry can and should do for us and what worlds they create \u2014 that is\ninteresting.\n\nIn 2003, the idea that a music player, a phone, a computer, and a camera would\nall be the same object small enough to fit in your pocket was a dream worthy\nof pursuit. In 2023, it isn\u2019t the object that is the problem, it\u2019s the world\nthat object has created around it. It\u2019s a world of perpetual access and\npersistent distraction, of vamping and voyeurism, of want and waste, of noise\nand never being alone. That one little object wraps us in an inhuman aura that\nwe are socially-pressured to deny as a luddite metaphor. But it is there. It\u2019s\ninvisible, but it may as well be a mechsuit. The world we make now is for\nliving like that.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be. It wasn\u2019t always.\n\nOur identity as humans-who-compute is probably irreversible. But our\nexperience as slaves to the everything machine can be changed \u2014 should be.\n\nWhich, after all, is the more appealing metaphor to wrap oneself in \u2014 a\nmechsuit or a bubble universe of one? Which affords the greatest mobility?\nWhich is most pliable to the growth of the interior \u2014 to the person inside?\n\n## \u201cThe Dream of the Personal Machine\u201d\n\nKyle Chayka is working on a book that sounds like it may make a good case for\nmy invisible mechsuit world. In a post titled, \u201cThe dream of the personal\nmachine,\u201d Chayka writes:\n\n> \u201cMy book is so much about how technology dictates culture. The devices that\n> we use aren\u2019t just accessories to culture or windows that we consume things\n> through; they are collaborators, gateways, and molds...the idea of a\n> personal computer had to be invented, manufactured, and marketed. We had to\n> imagine computers as personal machines.\u201d\n\nThis is an important point. We could live in a world where computing is a\npublic works \u2014 where terminals to central processing work like telephones used\nto. You can pick them up or put them down, but nothing inside of them is\nyours. But we don\u2019t live in that world. As soon as the first computer booted\nup in the first home, the computer became a personal object. And when an\nobject becomes personal, it is difficult to leave it behind. We want it with\nus.\n\nPerhaps that one thing \u2014 a simple desire for a personal machine \u2014 set us on\nthe course we have followed since. Not Moore\u2019s Law, not Capitalism, but\npersonhood.\n\nLater, in the same post, Chayka writes of the Palm Pilot \u2014 an early attempt at\nportable computing \u2014 that, despite it not providing much in the way of \u201cfun\u201d\nfeatures for a kid, there was still an \u201cineffable appeal to holding a gateway\nto a digital world in your hand.\u201d\n\nA world. There\u2019s that word again.\n\nWhy a world? There is a sense of dimensional transcendence to computers. As\nC.S. Lewis wrote of the wardrobe, \u201cIt\u2019s inside is bigger than its outside.\u201d In\nthe early days of mobile computing, it was hard to not compare the\ncapaciousness of a computer you could carry with you to something like a book.\nOf both you could say their insides were bigger than their outsides, but when\nit came to information, you\u2019d have to settle for figurative capaciousness in a\nbook; their actual contents are literally cover to cover. A digital machine\u2019s\ncontents are an entirely different thing.\n\nIn the time of the Palm Pilot, a tiny door to a vast digital world was more\npowerful as an idea than a tool. The digital world just wasn\u2019t as big back\nthen as it is now. But to Chayka\u2019s first point, we built the digital world\nusing these little devices that didn\u2019t do very much. We made it worth the\njourney. And meanwhile, the object was our companion, and inside was a tiny,\npersonal digital world \u2014 our notes, our messages, our few digital texts. It\nwas not much, but it was ours.\n\nChayka attributes his fascination with the personal machine to the anime he\nwatched as a kid. He writes:\n\n> \u201cWhat these fantastical, technological objects have in common is their\n> ability to modify carriers\u2019 immediate surroundings, flattening together the\n> actual and the virtual and forming a window from reality into the\n> unreal...Where Pokemon and Digimon depicted wholly alternate realities \u2014\n> virtual realms that were fun and cool, lol \u2014 the virtual world of today\u2019s\n> devices has simply overlaid the physical like a dense fog...I want a device\n> that is truly personal, in that it is a reflection of the self (unique,\n> changing, unstable).\u201d\n\nChayka\u2019s personal machine is one we probably believe we have already made \u2014\ndozens of times over. But have we? We\u2019ve made things we can carry that do more\nthan we ever dreamed they could. But we\u2019ve also made a world that consumes\nthat power uniformly. There\u2019s an assimilation to what the aura of technology\ndoes to us. If we could see the mechsuits, they\u2019d all look the same.\n\n## Design Fictions and Mind Objects\n\nI began with the simple idea that a single object can begin a lifelong\nfascination with technology. I still think that is true. But Kyle Chayka\ntraces his lifelong interest to both real objects, like his Palm Pilot, and\nfictional ones.\n\nJust as we all probably have that origin-object, we also probably have similar\nmemories of design fictions that filled us with wonder and expectation.\n\nMine have to be standard among people of a certain age: the communicator used\nin the original series of Star Trek (its gold mesh exterior always intrigued\nme, not to mention the sound it made when flipped open), or the tricorders and\nPADDs of The Next Generation. They were so fully-formed and so well designed\nthat they felt like prototyped inevitabilities, not props.\n\nAnd yet, the Star Trek devices weren\u2019t exactly personal, were they? The idea\nthat these objects were interchangeable was telegraphed regularly. Crew\nmembers would hand each other PADDs. Tricorders were retrieved from general\nstorage locations. Nothing had signs of the wear and tear that comes from\ndaily use or even the hint of a personal patina. It was a communicator, not my\ncommunicator.\n\nChayka points out that the personal machines from anime were not only unique\ncompared to the machines of our world and its glass-slab device vernacular,\nbut were unique to the owner. There was not only a sense of the personal that\ncame from a device being a person\u2019s one device, but also from it being theirs\n\u2014 inside and out. As if the manufacture of the device was simply its birth;\nfuture growth came from its use and user. Nature and nurture.\n\nI love that idea.\n\nIt\u2019s also what makes me sad \u2014 still to this day \u2014 that modular concepts like\nGoogle\u2019s Project Ara never caught on. It\u2019s what makes exploring the Mobile\nPhone Museum so fascinating. Browsing its collection makes clear the aesthetic\ntimeline leading directly to the current slab of glass in your hand right now.\nBut you can also follow the strange tributaries that came from who-knows-where\nbut were ultimately absorbed into the status quo. When I look at the diversity\nof form shown in that museum, I see an attempt to nurture the idea of a\npersonal device.\n\nBack to fictions for a moment.\n\nIn Inspector Gadget, Penny has a computer book (thanks for sending me, Robin)\nthat feels as bespoke as such a thing could be.\n\nIn Mary Doria Russell\u2019s Children of God, a human character born on a distant\nplanet after his mother\u2019s mission was marooned there grows up using a decades-\nold tablet recovered from her derelict ship. It becomes as precious and\npersonal to him as a diary or a family Bible of old \u2014 beginning not with the\nprinted scripture but with the hand-etched names of one\u2019s family tree. I\npictured his tablet with an exquisite patina.\n\nIn Quantum Leap, the protagonist is regularly visited by the hologram of his\nfriend, Al \u2014 somehow projected to him across time \u2014 who retrieves help every\nnow and then from a handlink device connected to... something somewhere. As\nthe show progressed, the handlink became so abstract I often wondered how Al \u2014\nor any human \u2014 could actually use it. It had no screen, no discernible\nbuttons. It was a handheld grid of pulsating color. It didn\u2019t occur to me\nuntil decades later that perhaps the handlink was a visual metaphor \u2014 a\nprojection within a projection \u2014 coming entirely from the mind of Al. That\nwould make it a mind-object. A totem. Entirely imaginary, yet with real power.\n\nMy interpretation of Al\u2019s handlink may tip the balance too far toward the\nmetaphysical. But tipping is part of the calibration process, and if anything,\nwe\u2019ve tipped too far the other way for too long.\n\nWhile I wait for the real world to shift in its personal machine culture, I\u2019d\nbe happy to see that happen in fiction first. All of my good examples are old!\nContemporary science fiction is still replete with design fictions. But as\nsophisticated and believable as they have become \u2014 I\u2019m especially thinking of\nthe foldable of Westworld \u2014 they\u2019re products. Regardless of the imagined\neconomic conditions of these futures, the same old material supply chain and\nassembly line manufacturing seems to be at work. Show me someone making\nsomething of their own. Show me an imaginary imagined device in an imaginary\nworld.\n\n(If there are any young industrial designers reading, I feel like I\u2019m writing\na manifesto charged with just the right amount of practical ignorance.)\n\n## Building a personal machine is not just a design problem.\n\nMany of the examples I\u2019ve looked at so far align with my ideas of what makes a\nmachine personal because they were designed with limitations imposed upon\nthem, and many of the examples I\u2019ve discussed that no longer feel personal\nhave been designed to surpass those limitations. If machines were designed to\nbe more personal, we\u2019d have very different machines.\n\nSometimes it feels like it is simply a matter of whether a machine is\nconnected to the internet or not. But of course it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s as\nmuch about what we do with our machines as it is about what they were designed\nto do.\n\nI think we can still experience the personal machine by choosing to experience\na machine that way.\n\nIn a way, the continued popularity of vinyl is a good example of this. For the\nsame price as a single record, you can get several months of access to more\nmusic than you could ever hear in that time. Still, some people choose records\nover digital files. It\u2019s too easy to dismiss this as an affectation. It\u2019s a\nchoice to experience music in a particular way. It\u2019s also a choice of a\npersonal machine \u2014 a record player rather than a phone.\n\nOne benefit of personal technology reaching the maturity it has is the\nabundance of choices. It may seem like you must use an iPhone \u2014 perhaps\neveryone you know and care about is group messaging with iMessage \u2014 but you\ncan choose something else. Every choice has benefits and costs. Ten years ago,\nI chose to leave Facebook. The benefits were many; the costs were not having\neasy access to where people I cared about shared information I wanted to know.\nA few years ago, I stopped using an e-reader \u2014 I had used a Kindle, and then a\nKobo, both great machines. The cost was no longer being able to send articles\nfrom the web to my machine and reading them, as well as books, in bed. The\nbenefit was not having too many choices in front of me when I just want to\nread one thing. I went back to the printed book. You could say that\u2019s as much\nof an affectation in 2023 as playing a vinyl record. Maybe. But it\u2019s a choice.\n\nI haven\u2019t owned a laptop for many years. My primary machine is a Mac Mini set\nup in my home office. The cost is I can\u2019t work from my couch or the local\ncoffee shop. The benefit is I have some separation in my life between work and\nnot work.\n\nFor me, these choices turn using the same machines everyone uses into a more\npersonal experience.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I can spend a lot of time indulging nostalgia for old\nmachines that did less and imagining collecting them and using them again. In\nsome cases, I\u2019ve done that. I started using a minidisc player again recently.\nIt\u2019s much more work and has many more limitations than just opening up Apple\nMusic on my phone. But, it\u2019s fun and it\u2019s mine. I own a few other pieces of\nold tech that mean something to me \u2014 my old Gameboy, my first cellphone, an\nold Handspring Visor. I keep these things running not for primary use, but to\nperiodically re-experience that old feeling of using something that did less\nand required more of my imagination. Friction is underrated.\n\nI also notice that when I look at these older machines and the old media they\nuse, I often find myself feeling like I\u2019m looking at a door to a world. I look\nat a book \u2014 there\u2019s a world. Every playable disc in our house \u2014 each a world.\n\nOnce you become accustomed to worldspotting, you can see them in anything.\nEvery object is a world.\n\n## In the World; of the Worlds\n\nPerhaps the days of personal machines are over. Maybe the complexities that\nMau and his cohort wrote about are not safely reducible. Maybe we can\u2019t\ndecomplexify the world of things. Maybe. And if we can, I wouldn\u2019t dare\nimagine it could happen quickly.\n\nBut if we can, where do we start? What do we look at? What do we use again,\ndespite there being sleeker, faster, frictionless options available? What\nlimits do we embrace so that we can re-balance the human with the machine?\n\nI have spent the last few years slowly disconnecting in various ways. I\u2019ve\nchosen to use things that only do a part of what readily available\nalternatives do and more. I\u2019ve chosen to stop using some things altogether. I\nhave found that these choices have enhanced my experiences because they\u2019ve\nsupported true insight; they\u2019ve helped me be more aware of what I\u2019m doing, why\nI\u2019m doing it, and who I am becoming. I have found that they change the world\nbecause they change my world.\n\nJung said that in each of us is another. I think that in each of us is another\nworld. A good personal machine reveals that world and helps us shape it.\n\n###### Written by Christopher Butler on July 9, 2023, In Essays\n\n###### Next Entry\n\nThe Big Picture When your clients are persuaded by your point of view and\nexpertise, they will not care what tools you use or what processes you follow.\nThey will\n\n###### Previous Entry\n\nGestalt Principles of Design \u2013 Symmetry The Gestalt Principles of Design are a\nset of concepts and guidelines drawn from gestalt psychology, which theorizes\nthat the mind tends to process\n\n###### \u2328 Keep up via Email or RSS\n\n###### \u273a Impressum\n\n###### \u00a9 Christopher Butler.
