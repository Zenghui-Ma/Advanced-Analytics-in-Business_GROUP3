In the meantime,\niPad users have relied on calculator apps in the App Store, such as PCalc and\nCalcbot.\n\nAppleInsider last week reported that macOS 15 will feature a revamped\nCalculator app with integration with the Notes app, a resizable window, a\nsidebar that lists recent calculations, and more. While we have not\nindependently confirmed those details, it is possible that the updated Mac app\nwill be based on the new iPad app.\n\nThe first beta of iPadOS 18 is expected to be released immediately following\nthe WWDC keynote, and the update should be widely released in September.\n\nNow, if only we could get Instagram and WhatsApp for the iPad...\n\nRelated Roundup: iOS 18\n\n[ 92 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nsniffies\n\n2 hours ago at 09:09 am\n\nFinally, Apple is able to bring Calculator app to iPad thanks to technological\nadvancements in AI and quantum computing.\n\nScore: 42 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nabatabia\n\n2 hours ago at 09:08 am\n\nIt\u2019s a miracle!!\n\nScore: 17 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\naUniqueName\n\n2 hours ago at 09:10 am\n\nHow bout the Health app on Mac?
