Stay tuned.\n\n## # 2024-04-01 - seL4 on AArch64 is now verified for functional correctness\n\nProofcraft has completed the formal mathematical proof that the seL4 code\nbehaves exactly as its abstract specification mandates on AArch64, thanks to\ncontinued support from NCSC.\n\nThis functional correctness property is the strongest assurance that can be\ngiven about the correctness of software, orders of magnitude stronger than\nmerely showing the absence of known flaws. Moreover, functional correctess is\nthe corner stone of even stronger assurance like security properties of\nintegrity and confidentiality.\n\nThe latest 64-bit Arm architecture is now on par with Arm 32-bit, RISC-V\n64-bit and Intel\u2019s x86 64-bit architectures with respect to seL4\u2019s functional\ncorrectness proof.\n\n## # 2024-01-26 - Automated proof checks for more verified platforms\n\nProofcraft, with funding from the seL4 Foundation, has extended the seL4 proof\nchecks to automatically include other verification platforms and\nconfigurations. As a result, there are now two further verified platforms\navailable and proof-checked regularly, bringing the total number of verified\nplatforms to six, with more in progress. The proofs are now also automatically\nchecked with and without the domain scheduler feature. This creates a base\nline for further improvements in proof genericity and automated platform\nverification.\n\nSo far the seL4 proof check infrastructure has been targeting only precisely\none platform and kernel configuration for each supported architecture. For\ninstance, for the ARM 32-bit architecture, the proof check only targets the\nimx6 Sabre Lite board (with 16 domains and no FPU). Nevertheless, the\nfunctional correctness proof also holds for any other number of domains and\nfor multiple additional boards, some with FPU.\n\nOur previous work on generating verification configurations from kernel\nconfigurations has made it possible to relatively easily re-run the proofs for\nmultiple configurations.\n\nWe have now extended the proof check infrastructure by adding a GitHub action\nthat automatically attempts to rebase all platform branches over each new push\nto the master branch and run a full proof check for this branch. If the check\nsucceeds, the branch is automatically updated (else, manual intervention is\nneeded, as before).\n\n\u00a9 2024 Proofcraft Pty Ltd\n\nseL4 is a registered trademark of LF Projects, LLC.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
