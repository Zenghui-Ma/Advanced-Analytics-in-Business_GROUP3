Source: DNY59 / Getty Images\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nHow many times has it happened? You\u2019re on your computer, searching for a\nparticular article, a hard-to-find fact, or a story you vaguely remember, and\njust when you seem to have discovered the exact right thing, a paywall\ndescends. \u201c$1 for Six Months.\u201d \u201cSave 40% on Year 1.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s Your Premium\nDigital Offer.\u201d \u201cAlready a subscriber?\u201d Hmm, no.\n\nNow you\u2019re faced with that old dilemma: to pay or not to pay. (Yes, you may\nface this very dilemma reading this story in The Atlantic.) And it\u2019s not even\nthat simple. It\u2019s a monthly or yearly subscription\u2014\u201cCancel at any time.\u201d Is\nthis article or story or fact important enough for you to pay?\n\nOr do you tell yourself\u2014as the overwhelming number of people do\u2014that you\u2019ll\njust keep searching and see if you can find it somewhere else for free?\n\nAccording to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, more than 75\npercent of America\u2019s leading newspapers, magazines, and journals are behind\nonline paywalls. And how do American news consumers react to that? Almost 80\npercent of Americans steer around those paywalls and seek out a free option.\n\nPaywalls create a two-tiered system: credible, fact-based information for\npeople who are willing to pay for it, and murkier, less-reliable information\nfor everyone else. Simply put, paywalls get in the way of informing the\npublic, which is the mission of journalism. And they get in the way of the\npublic being informed, which is the foundation of democracy. It is a terrible\ntime for the press to be failing at reaching people, during an election in\nwhich democracy is on the line. There\u2019s a simple, temporary solution:\nPublications should suspend their paywalls for all 2024 election coverage and\nall information that is beneficial to voters. Democracy does not die in\ndarkness\u2014it dies behind paywalls.\n\nThe problem is not just that professionally produced news is behind a wall;\nthe problem is that paywalls increase the proportion of free and easily\navailable stories that are actually filled with misinformation and\ndisinformation. Way back in 1995 (think America Online), the UCLA professor\nEugene Volokh predicted that the rise of \u201ccheap speech\u201d\u2014free internet\ncontent\u2014would not only democratize mass media by allowing new voices, but also\nincrease the proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy theories, which\nwould then destabilize mass media.\n\nPaul Barrett, the deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and\nHuman Rights and one of the premier scholars on mis- and disinformation, told\nme he knows of no research on the relationship between paywalls and\nmisinformation. \u201cBut it stands to reason,\u201d he said, \u201cthat if people seeking\nnews are blocked by the paywalls that are increasingly common on serious\nprofessional journalism websites, many of those people are going to turn to\nless reliable sites where they\u2019re more likely to encounter mis- and\ndisinformation.\u201d\n\nIn the pre-internet days, information wasn\u2019t free\u2014it just felt that way.\nNewsstands were everywhere, and you could buy a paper for a quarter. But that\npaper wasn\u2019t just for you: After you read it at the coffee shop or on the\ntrain, you left it there for the next guy. The same was true for magazines.\nWhen I was the editor of Time, the publisher estimated that the \u201cpass-along\nrate\u201d of every issue was 10 to 15\u2014that is, each magazine we sent out was read\nnot only by the subscriber, but by 10 to 15 other people. In 1992, daily\nnewspapers claimed a combined circulation of some 60 million; by 2022, while\nthe nation had grown, that figure had fallen to 21 million. People want\ninformation to be free\u2014and instantly available on their phone.\n\nBarrett is aware that news organizations need revenue, and that almost a third\nof all U.S. newspapers have stopped publishing over the previous two decades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable that traditional news-gathering businesses are desperate\nfor subscription revenue,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut they may be inadvertently boosting\nthe fortunes of fake news operations motivated by an appetite for clicks or an\nideological agenda\u2014or a combination of the two.\u201d\n\nDigital-news consumers can be divided into three categories: a small, elite\ngroup that pays hundreds to thousands of dollars a year for high-end\nsubscriptions; a slightly larger group of people with one to three news\nsubscriptions; and the roughly 80 percent of Americans who will not or cannot\npay for information. Some significant percentage of this latter category are\nwhat scholars call \u201cpassive\u201d news consumers\u2014people who do not seek out\ninformation, but wait for it to come to them, whether from their social feeds,\nfrom friends, or from a TV in an airport. Putting reliable information behind\npaywalls increases the likelihood that passive news consumers will receive bad\ninformation.\n\nIn the short history of social media, the paywall was an early hurdle to\ngetting good information; now there are newer and more perilous problems. The\nWall Street Journal instituted a \u201chard paywall\u201d in 1996. The Financial Times\nformally launched one in 2002. Other publications experimented with them,\nincluding The New York Times, which established its subscription plan and\npaywall in 2011. In 2000, I was the editor of Time.com, Time magazine\u2019s\nwebsite, when these experiments were going on. The axiom then was that \u201cmust\nhave\u201d publications like The Wall Street Journal could get away with charging\nfor content, while \u201cnice to have\u201d publications like Time could not.\nJournalists were told that \u201cinformation wants to be free.\u201d But the truth was\nsimpler: People wanted free information, and we gave it to them. And they got\nused to it.\n\nOf course, publications need to cover their costs, and journalists need to be\npaid. Traditionally, publications had three lines of revenue: subscriptions,\nadvertising, and newsstand sales. Newsstand sales have mostly disappeared. The\ninternet should have been a virtual newsstand, but buying individual issues or\narticles is almost impossible. The failure to institute a frictionless\nmechanism for micropayments to purchase news was one of the greatest missteps\nin the early days of the web. Some publications would still be smart to try\nit.\n\nI\u2019d argue that paywalls are part of the reason Americans\u2019 trust in media is at\nan all-time low. Less than a third of Americans in a recent Gallup poll say\nthey have \u201ca fair amount\u201d or a \u201ca great deal\u201d of trust that the news is fair\nand accurate. A large percentage of these Americans see media as being biased.\nWell, part of the reason they think media are biased is that most fair,\naccurate, and unbiased news sits behind a wall. The free stuff needn\u2019t be fair\nor accurate or unbiased. Disinformationists, conspiracy theorists, and Russian\nand Chinese troll farms don\u2019t employ fact-checkers and libel lawyers and copy\neditors.\n\nPart of the problem with the current, free news environment is that the\nplatform companies, which are the largest distributors of free news, have\ndeprioritized news. Meta has long had an uncomfortable relationship with news\non Facebook. In the past year, according to CNN, Meta has changed its\nalgorithm in a way that has cost some news outlets 30 to 40 percent of their\ntraffic (and others more). Threads, Meta\u2019s answer to X, is \u201cnot going to do\nanything to encourage\u201d news and politics on the platform, says Adam Mosseri,\nthe executive who oversees it. \u201cMy take is, from a platforms\u2019 perspective, any\nincremental engagement or revenue [news] might drive is not at all worth the\nscrutiny, negativity (let\u2019s be honest), or integrity risks that come along\nwith them.\u201d The platform companies are not in the news business; they are in\nthe engagement business. News is less engaging than, say, dance shorts or\nchocolate-chip-cookie recipes\u2014or eye-catching conspiracy theories.\n\nAs the platforms have diminished news, they have also weakened their integrity\nand content-moderation teams, which enforce community standards or terms of\nservice. No major platform permits false advertising, child pornography, hate\nspeech, or speech that leads to violence; the integrity and moderation teams\ntake down such content. A recent paper from Barrett\u2019s team at the NYU Stern\nCenter for Business and Human Rights argues that the greatest tech-related\nthreat in 2024 is not artificial intelligence or foreign election\ninterference, but something more mundane: the retreat from content moderation\nand the hollowing-out of trust-and-safety units and election-integrity teams.\nThe increase in bad information on the free web puts an even greater burden on\nfact-based news reporting.\n\nNow AI-created clickbait is also a growing threat. Generative AI\u2019s ability to\nmodel, scrape, and even plagiarize real news\u2014and then tailor it to users\u2014is\nextraordinary. AI clickbait mills, posing as legitimate journalistic\norganizations, are churning out content that rips off real news and reporting.\nThese plagiarism mills are receiving funding because, well, they\u2019re cheap and\nprofitable. For now, Google\u2019s rankings don\u2019t appear to make a distinction\nbetween a news article written by a human being and one written by an AI\nchatbot. They can, and they should.\n\nThe best way to address these challenges is for newsrooms to remove or suspend\ntheir paywalls for stories related to the 2024 election. I am mindful of the\nirony of putting this plea behind The Atlantic\u2019s own paywall, but that\u2019s\nexactly where the argument should be made. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ve\nprobably paid to support journalism that you think matters in the world. Don\u2019t\nyou want it to be available to others, too, especially those who would not\notherwise get to see it?\n\nEmergencies and natural disasters have long prompted papers to suspend their\npaywalls. When Hurricane Irene hit the New York metropolitan area in 2011, The\nNew York Times made all storm-related coverage freely available. \u201cWe are aware\nof our obligations to our audience and to the public at large when there is a\nbig story that directly impacts such a large portion of people,\u201d a New York\nTimes editor said at the time. In some ways, this creates a philosophical\ninconsistency. The paywall says, This content is valuable and you have to pay\nfor it. Suspending the paywall in a crisis says, This content is so valuable\nthat you don\u2019t have to pay for it. Similarly, when the coronavirus hit, The\nAtlantic made its COVID coverage\u2014and its COVID Tracking Project\u2014freely\navailable to all.\n\nDuring the pandemic, some publications found that suspending their paywall had\nan effect they had not anticipated: It increased subscriptions. The Seattle\nTimes, the paper of record in a city that was an early epicenter of\ncoronavirus, put all of its COVID-related content outside the paywall and then\nsaw, according to its senior vice president of marketing, Kati Erwert, \u201ca very\nsignificant increase in digital subscriptions\u201d\u2014two to three times its previous\ndaily averages. The Philadelphia Inquirer put its COVID content outside its\npaywall in the spring of 2020 as a public service. And then, according to the\npaper\u2019s director of special projects, Evan Benn, it saw a \u201chigher than usual\nnumber of digital subscription sign-ups.\u201d\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times, The Denver Post, and The St. Paul Pioneer Press, in\nMinnesota, all experienced similar increases, as did papers operated by the\nTribune Publishing Company, including the Chicago Tribune and the Hartford\nCourant. The new subscribers were readers who appreciated the content and the\nreporting and wanted to support the paper\u2019s efforts, and to make the coverage\nfree for others to read, too.\n\nGood journalism isn\u2019t cheap, but outlets can find creative ways to pay for\ntheir reporting on the election. They can enlist foundations or other sponsors\nto underwrite their work. They can turn to readers who are willing to\nsubscribe, renew their subscriptions, or make added donations to subsidize\nimportant coverage during a crucial election. And they can take advantage of\nthe broader audience that unpaywalled stories can reach, using it to generate\nmore advertising revenue\u2014and even more civic-minded subscribers.\n\nThe reason papers suspend their paywall in times of crisis is because they\nunderstand that the basic and primary mission of the press is to inform and\neducate the public. This idea goes back to the country\u2019s Founders. The press\nwas protected by the First Amendment so it could provide the information that\nvoters need in a democracy. \u201cOur liberty depends on the freedom of the press,\u201d\nThomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cand that cannot be limited without being lost.\u201d Every\njournalist understands this. There is no story with a larger impact than an\nelection in which the survival of democracy is on the ballot.\n\nI believe it was a mistake to give away journalism for free in the 1990s.\nInformation is not and never has been free. I devoutly believe that news\norganizations need to survive and figure out a revenue model that allows them\nto do so. But the most important mission of a news organization is to provide\nthe public with information that allows citizens to make the best decisions in\na constitutional democracy. Our government derives its legitimacy from the\nconsent of the governed, and that consent is arrived at through the free flow\nof information\u2014reliable, fact-based information. To that end, news\norganizations should put their election content in front of their paywall. The\nConstitution protects the press so that the press can protect constitutional\ndemocracy. Now the press must fulfill its end of the bargain.\n\nRichard Stengel is a former managing editor of Time, former U.S.\nundersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, and author of\nInformation Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation and\nWhat We Can Do About It.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
