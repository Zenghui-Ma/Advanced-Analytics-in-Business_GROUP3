Not only does it save space but builders can assemble some creative\nrigs to fulfill their gaming needs. While the industry has seen a lot of\nsupport for the SFF PC segment in the form of DIY components, there isn't an\nexact list of guidelines of what hardware goes best with each other. But\nNVIDIA is looking to simply do this with its new initiative.\n\n##### Related Story NVIDIA To Ship Millions Of Blackwell GPUs, Propelling TSMC\nCoWoS & HBM DRAM Demand To New Levels\n\nWe have learned that NVIDIA is working with its partners which not only\ninclude AICs (graphics card makers) but also chassis, PSU, manufacturers, etc,\nto put together components that are perfect for SFF builds. Why this is so\nimportant because SFF builds are generally more constrained when we compare\nthem to traditional builds. There's the matter of space constraint, airflow &\nthe right PSU choice.\n\nImage Source: NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA will be laying out SFF guidelines which will be passed over to its\npartners & eventually help gamers build these compact PCs. The guidelines will\ninclude the creation of a standard for AICs & chassis manufacturers based on\ndimensions and clearances between enthusiast GPUs and SFF PC chassis.\nFollowing is the main description of the new ecosystem:\n\n> Enthusiasts around the world are choosing Small Form Factor chassis for\n> their dream rigs.\n>\n> However, when building around modern enthusiast GPUs, finding the best\n> components for a SFF (Small Form Factor) build can be challenging.\n>\n> NVIDIA has developed form factor guidelines to help Gamers pick the best\n> GeForce RTX GPU and components for their SFF build.\n>\n> These guidelines provide dimensions and clearances between enthusiast\n> graphics cards and SFF chassis, creating a standard for AIC and chassis\n> manufacturers to help make building SFF Gaming PCs a great experience.\n\nNow you must be wondering if this opens up the space for more Mini-ITX and\ncompact NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs. Well, the answer is both a yes and no. You\nsee, NVIDIA won't be offering any compact variants of its own since this is\nmostly a partner-driven program but partners are free to experiment with their\nsolutions to offer GPUs that comply with the \"SFF Enthusiast GeForce\" label.\n\nThe labels will be applied to both existing and new graphics cards from AICs\nso we can expect the GeForce RTX 4060 & 4060 Ti series to be the first to\nadopt this new standard as a true compact ITX (SFF) solution. But the \"SFF\nEnthusiast GPU\" label isn't confined to ITX options.\n\nImage Source: NVIDIA\n\nThere are also enthusiast GPUs that can be accommodated within SFF PC chassis\nthat support 3-slot wide cards. The new initiative will encourage partners to\ninnovate around high-performance graphics cards which can be paired with ITX\nmotherboards within SFF PC builds and that sounds good for the entire PC\nsegment. Currently, there's no exact date on when we'll see the program go\nlive but it should be made official shortly so stay tuned for more information\nand announcements.\n\nShare this story\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\n### Further Reading\n\n  * #### NVIDIA A100 \u201cAmpere\u201d GPUs With 7936 Cores Being Sold In China, 15% More Cores Than Original A100s\n\n  * #### NVIDIA Partners Raise Price Across Various GeForce RTX 40 & RTX 30 GPUs, Up To 10% Hikes\n\n  * #### NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090D Gaming & H20 AI GPUs Can Be Next on US\u2019s Chopping Block For China As 70 TFLOPs Restriction Goes In Effect This Week\n\n  * #### NVIDIA Continues To Dominate Steam GPU Charts, RTX 3060 Most Popular Followed By RTX 2060\n\n### Comments\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  * #### Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 Flagships Could Feature High-Capacity 5,500mAh Batteries To Compensate For The Chipset\u2019s Increased Power Consumption\n\n68 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) Gives Advice To Concerned Investors on How To Prevent Their Shares From Being Loaned Out For Short Positions\n\n50 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Starfield Is About to Get Some Really Good Updates Soon, Says Howard\n\n48 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Kirin 9010 Is Huawei\u2019s Latest Smartphone SoC With A 12-core CPU Cluster, Is Regarded As A Faster Variant To The Kirin 9000S, Lithography Unknown\n\n37 Active Readers\n\n  * #### PlayStation 5 Pro Is Needed for Advancing Visuals, Performance, as There\u2019s No Untapped PS5 Potential Due to Homogenized CPU, GPU Design\n\n32 Active Readers\n\n### Popular Discussions\n\n  * #### AMD RDNA 4 & RDNA 3+ GPUs Receive Updated Support In Linux Graphics Drivers\n\n1287 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Arrow Lake-S 24 & 20 Core Desktop CPUs Spotted: Core Ultra 200 ES Chips Without SMT, Up To 3 GHz\n\n1130 Comments\n\n  * #### NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 RMA in China Becomes a Huge Issue, Full Refunds Offered To Affectees\n\n1042 Comments\n\n  * #### Jim Keller Criticizes NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell\u2019s $10 Billion R&D Cost, Says It Could\u2019ve Been Achievable In $1 Billion\n\n921 Comments\n\n  * #### AMD Launches Ryzen PRO 8000 Desktop APUs, Bringing Graphics & AI Leadership To Businesses\n\n774 Comments\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your\ninbox\n\n###### Follow us on\n\nFacebook Youtube Twitter\n\n###### Topics\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Gaming\n  * Mobile\n  * Finance\n  * Software\n  * Security\n  * Web\n\n###### Sections\n\n  * Deals\n  * Reviews\n  * Videos\n  * How To's\n  * Analysis\n  * Exclusives\n  * Interviews\n\n###### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise with Us\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Careers\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy & Cookie Policy\n  * Ethics Statement\n  * Appeal Moderation\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
