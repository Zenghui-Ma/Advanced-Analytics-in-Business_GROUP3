Setting up such a European research\norganisation is a longstanding demand by some in the AI community worried that\nthe continent is falling further behind the US and China in the technology.\n\nEDIRAS would give researchers \u201cmassive\u201d high-performing computation power, a\nsustainable cloud infrastructure, high quality data, talent and training, says\nthe advisory group, formally called the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM), in\na report handed to the Commission today.\n\nProbably the most famous example of AI in science is Alphafold, a system\ndeveloped by Google-owned Deepmind, which can predict the structure of\nproteins, although there is some scepticism this will significantly speed up\ndrug discovery.\n\nWith AI capabilities advancing at dizzying speed, the group\u2019s recommendation\nwas developed at an unusually fast pace, a sign of its political importance,\nsaid Nicole Grobert, a nanomaterials professor at the University of Oxford who\nchairs the scientific advice group.\n\n\u201cIt usually takes a year, but here the request came in July and the pressure\nto finish was enormous. The Commission really wanted this report out,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nBut today\u2019s proposal is much narrower than those campaigning for a \u201cCERN for\nAI\u201d would like to see.\n\nHolger Hoos, an Alexander von Humboldt professor for AI at RWTH Aachen\nUniversity and a founder of the Confederation of Laboratories for AI Research\nin Europe (Claire), said that while he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to see the idea gaining\ntraction, it lacked the \u201cambition, vision and the kind of compelling\nmotivation\u201d set out in CERN for AI plans Claire has advanced over the last six\nyears.\n\nToo narrow?\n\nThe chief problem, in Hoos\u2019s view, is that the proposed EDIRAS is focused\nlargely on using AI to speed up science, rather than any broader uses that\ncould benefit industry or government, say.\n\n\u201cWe are all in favour of investing into AI for science, but we believe that\nthis should not be the exclusive or even principal focus of \u2018AI made in\nEurope\u2019\u201d, he said. \u201cFor example, \u2018AI for engineering\u2019, \u2018AI for manufacturing\u2019,\n\u2018AI for public administration\u2019 are all also very important,\u201d he said.\n\nInside the Commission, there\u2019s the view that creating AI tools for scientists\ncould ultimately boost European innovation far more than the current wave of\nchatbots, such as ChatGPT, created by US tech giants.\n\n\u201cUsing AI in science is probably one of the best use cases,\u201d said competition\ncommissioner Margrethe Vestager \u2013 who requested the review \u2013 today in a\ndiscussion of the report. \u201cMe using AI to figure out how to make a dinner plan\n[...] may not be worth the energy used to do it.\u201d\n\nRather than simply trying to ape the large language models of US tech giants,\nthe EU could instead try to carve out AI niches where it can lead the world;\nand tools for AI science is one area in which the bloc has been relatively\nforward-thinking, a Commission official argued.\n\nToo spread out?\n\nThe proposed EDIRAS institute would also be \u201cdistributed\u201d - that is, spread\nout across the continent. \u201cThis has the advantage of bringing everyone on\nboard. All parts of Europe would be included and have transparent and easy\naccess,\u201d said Grobert.\n\nA physical institute in a single location would be outdated in the era of home\nworking, she said.\n\nOne model could be Elixir, a federated data infrastructure set up by the\nEuropean Molecular Biology Organisation, a Commission official said.\n\nKimmo Koski, CEO of CSC-IT Centre for Science in Finland and coordinator of\nthe consortium which manages the LUMI supercomputer, said a distributed\ninstitute would make the most sense, and pointed out that most CERN scientists\ntoday are based around the world.\n\n\u201cIt is much more feasible, cost-efficient and also quality-wise better to\nexpand with the current concepts than to start from scratch,\u201d he said.\n\nSupercomputers like LUMI within the EU\u2019s EuroHPC joint undertaking are already\nwell designed to support the development of AI systems. \u201cI think the win-win\nsituation in Europe and EuroHPC is when we are able to provide different kinds\nof resources for different kinds of needs, with the same ecosystem,\u201d Koski\nsaid.\n\nBut Hoos wants a new central facility with supercomputers used exclusively for\nAI. \u201cI believe any moonshot effort needs a visible focal point,\u201d he said. He\u2019s\nalso worried that the distributed nature of EDIRAS could \u201cfar too easily be\nimplemented by relatively cost-neutral rebranding of rather ineffective\nexisting initiatives\u201d.\n\nGrobert acknowledged that EDIRAS would encompass existing AI facilities, but\nwould also involve \u201cinvesting heavily in new infrastructure\u201d as well.\n\nA Commission source pointed out that it would be difficult to get EU states to\nagree to a centralised location for a new CERN-like facility, given the\nsensitivity of AI.\n\nHoos also said that neither he nor a \u201cmajor part of the AI community\u201d had been\nconsulted on the report, despite championing the CERN for AI idea it takes up.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bode well in terms of making sure that those who would benefit\nfrom or shape it if implemented are on board,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SAM report was based partly on an evidence review by a consortium of\nEurope\u2019s leading science academies, called Science Advice for Policy by\nEuropean Academies. A policy advisor for that group said they had consulted a\nmember of Claire\u2019s extended core team when gathering the evidence.\n\nBudget\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of the budget. Today\u2019s report does not specify a\ncost for EDIRAS, which Grobert said was a decision for the Commission. It\n\u201cneeds to take a bold approach\u201d in order to be competitive, she said. Claire\nand non-profit association euRobotics, meanwhile, have asked for \u20ac100 billion\nover six years.\n\nBut according to a Commission source, the most plausible path was to pilot\nEDIRAS as part of Horizon Europe, with the potential to scale it up from 2028\nin the next framework programme \u2013 a similar path taken by the European\nInnovation Council, which was trialed in the later stages of Horizon 2020.\n\nThis would admittedly mean a delay until 2028 to get it fully off the ground,\nbut there were no other obvious EU funding mechanisms to hand, they said.\n\nMattias Bj\u00f6rnmalm, secretary general of CESAER, an association of European\nuniversities of science and technology, welcomed the science-focused approach\nto AI, and the effort to tackle these issues at a European level.\n\n\u201cPart of the reasoning for CERN from a scientific perspective was the pooling\nof resources to make and advance huge infrastructure, which is difficult to do\non an individual level,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he would have liked to have seen more clarity on the required budget.\nThere is too often a disconnect between political ambitions, and decisions to\ncut programmes such as Horizon Europe which are key to their implementation.\n\nThe SAM report also recommends \u201ccreative\u201d public-private partnerships to make\nprivate data available for research with AI, and to provide financial support\nfor the development of specialised tools for scientists, such as foundation\nmodels and AI research assistants.\n\nThe efforts should focus not only on physical and life sciences, but also on\nhumanities and social sciences, and they should ensure that AI systems are\naligned with \u201cEuropean values\u201d, the scientific advisors say.\n\nIt is now up to the Commission to decide to what extent it will implement the\nrecommendations. It comes after the Commission published its own set of\nguidelines for the use of generative AI in research.\n\nNever miss an update from Science|Business: Newsletter sign-up\n\n#### Related News\n\nViewpoint: FP10 should fund AI for peace, ageing \u2013 and European leadership\n\n09 Apr 2024\n\nEU and US to work together on AI guidelines\n\n05 Apr 2024\n\nUK and US to work together to develop safety tests for advanced AI systems\n\n02 Apr 2024\n\nAleph Alpha, TU Munich, ETH Zurich: how the Dieter Schwarz Foundation is\nattracting Germany's AI elite\n\n21 Mar 2024\n\n#### Get the free Science|Business newsletter\n\nReceive our news bulletin each Tuesday & Thursday and news about bridging\nEurope\u2019s east-west innovation gap twice a month in The Widening.\n\nSign up for the Bulletin\n\nSign up for The Widening\n\n#### Jobs\n\nEureka is seeking a Process Expert Evaluation and Ethics\n\nCSIC is looking for a R&I Internationalisation Technician\n\n#### Climate news\n\nRead our expanding news coverage of climate technologies and policies here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy | T&Cs | \u00a9 2024 Science Business Publishing Ltd.\n\nClose menu\n\n", "frontpage": true}
