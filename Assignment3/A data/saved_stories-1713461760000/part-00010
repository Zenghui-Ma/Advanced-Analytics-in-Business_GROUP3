My brain injury has shaken\nmy confidence in my own personality, my own existence.\n\nBy Hana Schank\n\nMarcus Sch\u00e4fer / Trunk Archive\n\nJune 17, 2021\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up\nfor it here.\n\nThe worst things can happen on the most beautiful days. My family\u2019s worst day\nwas a perfect one in the summer of 2019. We picked my daughter up from camp\nand talked about where to go for lunch: the diner or the burger place. I don\u2019t\nremember which we chose. What I do remember: being woken up, again and again,\nby doctors who insist on asking me the same questions\u2014my name, where I am,\nwhat month it is\u2014and telling me the same story, a story that I am sure is\nwrong.\n\n\u201cYou were in a car accident,\u201d they say. But this cannot be. We\u2019re having lunch\nand then going on a hike. I had promised the think tank where I work that I\u2019d\ncall in to a 4 p.m. meeting.\n\n\u201cYou are in Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital in New Hampshire.\u201d Another ludicrous\nstatement. I started the day in Vermont. Surely if I had crossed the river to\nNew Hampshire I would know it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d they ask me, and I tell them and tell them and tell them.\n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d \u201cNew Hampshire,\u201d I say, except for one time when I say\n\u201cVermont.\u201d \u201cNew Hampshire,\u201d they correct, and I want to say, \u201cReally, we are\nso close to the border here, can\u2019t you just give it to me this once?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were in a car accident,\u201d they tell me again. \u201cYour husband broke his leg\nand your son broke his collarbone.\u201d These do not seem like horrible injuries,\nso I am waiting for the worse news, the news that my daughter is dead. She is\nthe youngest and the smallest. She was born with albinism, and her existence\nhas always felt improbable, and so now it must be over.\n\nBut\u2014thank God\u2014it\u2019s not. \u201cYour daughter has fractures in her spine and damage\nto her lower intestine from the seat belt.\u201d They tell me that my lower\nintestine was also injured, and that I\u2019ve had surgery. I lift up my hospital\ngown and am surprised to see an angry red line and industrial-size staples. I\nremember an article I\u2019d read about seat belts not being designed for women,\nand I ask the doctor if he sees more women with these injuries than men. I\nhave yet to take in the reality of what has happened to me, to my family.\nInstead I am thinking about writing an expos\u00e9 about the sexist seat-belt\nindustry.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### Why Aren\u2019t U.S. Cars Popular in Japan?\n\nAlana Semuels\n\n  * ### Hot Streaks in Your Career Don\u2019t Happen by Accident\n\nDerek Thompson\n\n  * ### A Journey Into the Animal Mind\n\nRoss Andersen\n\nThey wake me up and ask me where I am and what my name is. A doctor asks me\nwho the president is. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say,\u201d I reply. He smiles. I am at\nDartmouth for three days before I am transferred to the University of Vermont,\nwhere my husband and children are. The days pass like minutes, a loop of sleep\ninterrupted by people asking me questions and telling me terrible things.\n\nJoshua Sharpe: We should all be more afraid of driving\n\nOne of the things I am told is that I have a brain bleed and a traumatic brain\ninjury. I wonder if this is why I am slurring my words, but am told that the\nslurring is from the anti-seizure medication I am on. This sounds good. The\nslurring will stop. A doctor tells me I \u201cgot my bell rung.\u201d This is a bad\nanalogy. Bell clappers are meant to slam against the side of the bell. The\nbrain is not meant to slam against the side of the skull.\n\nOf all the injuries my family is suffering from, mine is the worst. This is my\ntotally biased opinion. My husband\u2019s leg will take almost a year to heal. My\ndaughter would have died if not for the surgery to repair her flayed abdomen.\nShe is 10, and one of her friends tells her that because of the scar she will\nnever be able to wear a bikini. She spends many days attempting to suss out\nwhether she cares. She doesn\u2019t yet know if she is the bikini-wearing type.\n\nMy 13-year-old son is the only one who remembers the accident. He remembers a\nwoman in a ponytail calling 911, the smell of gasoline and burnt metal. He\nremembers his father yelling \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d He will have to live with the\nmemory of his sister looking at my body and asking, \u201cIs Mama dead?\u201d\n\nThese are terrible injuries, and yet, the other members of my family don\u2019t\nwalk around thinking, Am I still me? My brain injury has shaken my confidence\nin my own personality, my own existence. This is the worst injury.\n\nWhen we leave the hospital and move into a hotel, I frequently get lost in the\nhallway. The first time I roll into occupational therapy with my walker, I am\ngrateful for the obvious signage pointing me toward the check-in desk. It\u2019s\nalmost as though the clinic is expecting people with brain damage.\n\nMy therapist is a smiling, 40-something woman with dirty-blond hair. She\nreminds me of me before the accident. She asks if I am having any thinking\nproblems or memory problems. I tell her about an incident with Parmesan\ncheese.\n\n\u201cCan you get the Parmesan?\u201d my husband asked.\n\nI opened the fridge and looked. I looked and looked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find it,\u201d I said with a shrug.\n\nMy son opened the fridge and pulled out a block of Parmesan.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t occurred to me that this was a brain issue. Sometimes you just can\u2019t\nfind the Parmesan. Right?\n\nA test confirms that I have trouble scanning a visual field for objects. My\nbrain is struggling to recognize what I see, but without a pre-accident\nbaseline to judge from, there is no way to know how much worse I am at it now.\nHave I always been bad at finding things? Maybe? There are limits to how well\nan injured brain can scrutinize an injured brain.\n\nI have other visual-processing issues. At first I can\u2019t watch television\nbecause my brain is unable to merge the images from my two eyes, so I see\ndoubles of everything\u2014two Phoebes, two Chandlers. I can watch with one eye\nclosed, but I\u2019m distracted, seething at my brain for failing to do such a\nsimple task.\n\nPatricia Voulgaris\n\nIn one session, the therapist tells me we are going to play a game. She pulls\nout a deck of cards and asks me to turn cards over while saying the number or\nthe color or the suit. The game is so difficult, I want to physically remove\nmy brain from my skull and hurl it against a wall. I will never play this game\nagain as long as I live.\n\nEventually I graduate from occupational therapy. But occupational therapy\nisn\u2019t about getting people back on their feet so they can return to think\ntanks. It is about making sure they can run errands without getting lost. I am\nsomeone who has always taken pride in my intelligence, and now I am not so\nsmart. I am just a functional human being, according to occupational therapy.\n\nWhen we go out in public as a family, we are a walking nightmare. \u201cWow,\u201d a\nstranger says, marveling at the device that is bolted into my husband\u2019s femur.\nAnd then my son appears with his arm in a sling, my daughter limps over in her\nback brace. An injured couple is potentially funny. There is nothing funny\nabout an injured family. \u201cWhat happened to you guys?\u201d\n\nWhen we tell the story, we explain that we were in no way at fault, which\nfeels important. We wore our seat belts and drove the speed limit and the\nweather wasn\u2019t bad and yet this happened to us. Someone was driving a pickup\ntruck in the opposite direction. He was late to a job interview or to get his\nkid, or maybe he was just antsy. In front of him was a motorcycle slowing him\ndown. Maybe he\u2019d been behind that motorcycle for miles. Maybe he liked to take\nrisks. He pulled into our lane and passed the motorcycle while going up a hill\nat 70 miles per hour. I don\u2019t know who makes this kind of decision. Did he\nthink, I can\u2019t believe I did something this stupid? Did he also yell \u201cJesus\nChrist\u201d?\n\nBecause we are not at fault, accident feels like the wrong word. Not just\nwrong, but unfair. My husband starts calling it the incident, but an incident\nis a small thing, not something that scars you for life. The smashing? The\ndestruction? Newbury, after the town where it occurred? The only thing that\ncomes close is the devastation.\n\nThe devastated me is different. My brain used to race, making lists and plans,\nskipping from an article I was researching to whether my kids were in\nappropriate after-school programs to what vacation we should take in February.\nNow it does none of that. There are no plans to make.\n\nA few days after regaining consciousness, I check my Twitter feed. I have\nalways been a news junkie. But I have missed nothing. The news seems to be not\njust familiar but actually repeating itself. Something bonkers happened in the\nWhite House. People are dying in a country I\u2019ve never been to. A company did\nsomething possibly illegal. There was a house fire in the Bronx. Are these the\nthings I used to care about?\n\nThe most interesting piece of news is the one I am experiencing. In the\nhospital we are waiting to make sure my daughter can poop through her\nreconstructed colon. This article isn\u2019t in The New York Times.\n\nWhen we return to New York I take the subway to doctor appointments. I don\u2019t\ntake out my phone, I just sit. My brain is quiet, which I find suspicious, but\nalso soothing. Before the accident I went to yoga retreats and tried\nmeditation. I said things like \u201cI just need to unplug.\u201d Apparently what I\nneeded was to get hit by a truck. Perhaps I have discovered the secret to a\npeaceful mind, and it is traumatic brain injury. I fantasize about opening an\nexpensive spa where busy people pay me money to whack them on the head with a\nbaseball bat.\n\nThe day of the accident I had been working on a project to improve how\nhomeless people are placed into shelters. I say out loud, \u201cI don\u2019t care about\nhomeless people\u201d to see how it feels. It doesn\u2019t ring true; I do care about\nhomeless people. I just don\u2019t feel like working. I have always been a regular\nexerciser. Now I can\u2019t imagine wanting to do a burpee, let alone 10 of them. I\nalways ate healthy things. But did you know that you can eat whole grains and\nstill get hit by a truck?\n\nI have strange cravings. I think about apple cider all the time. Apple cider\nis not a normal part of my diet. I have a very detailed dream about eating\nchocolate cake. I eat the cake. That\u2019s the entire dream. I find myself\nforaging in the fridge for flavors that don\u2019t exist.\n\nI don\u2019t know which symptoms are permanent and which are temporary. At first,\nthe doctors say that after a year or two I\u2019m likely to have a full return to\nmy normal brain function. Or not. They don\u2019t really know about the brain. It\nmight be more like 95 percent. If I broke my elbow and someone told me I\u2019d get\n95 percent of my elbow function back, I\u2019d be satisfied. But 95 percent of my\nbrain function sounds terrifying. Which pieces will be missing?\n\nSome days I feel like myself. Other days all I can think about is the old life\nthat is gone. Then, halfway through my recuperation, the coronavirus comes.\nThe stores close, the schools close, the traffic on the avenue dwindles to a\nsporadic whoosh. And my busy friends who were always texting me about their\ncrazy schedules are suddenly as quiet as I am. Together we wait for normal to\nreturn. The difference is that they know what normal looks like.\n\nIn July it will be two years since the accident. The world is now coming back\nto life, my days slowly filling up with work and chores and exercise. Soon I\nwill go back to in-person meetings and travel, and I wonder: Will I be up to\nthe challenge? Or will I get lost in office buildings and airports?\n\nFor now, in this liminal space between the old life and the new one, I often\ncatch myself staring at my children. They have never been more beautiful. I\nchalk this up to the magic of braces\u2013\u2013their teeth are finally coming into\nalignment\u2013\u2013but I know this is ridiculous. They are beautiful because they are\nalive. I look at them, and I sit with the silence. Today, it is mine.\nTomorrow, it may not be.\n\nHana Schank is the director of strategy for public interest technology at New\nAmerica.
