Details depend on the country,\nthe category of goods offered, and of course the tenacity and wealth of the\ntrademark holder. I recall, evidently correctly, that Unix Pacific, the\norganization created to distribute and support AT&T (later USL) Unix systems\nin the Asia/Pacific area had to step carefully around trademark issues with\nMarantz in Japan.\n\nUNIX\u00ae was registered by Bell Laboratories as a trademark for computer\noperating systems. Today this mark is owned by Open Group, who are happy to\ntell you about how they would like it to be used.\n\n## Results\n\nI decided to gather whatever not-our-Unix items I could; here is the current\nharvest. Other sightings and scans gratefully accepted.\n\nWhen you look up the four letters in the search engines of the US Patent and\nTrademark Office, you find many products that use the name in some way. Many\nclearly refer to the OS, but others seem independent. For example, to clip one\nout, we find\n\n    \n    \n    Word Mark: UNIX DIAPERS BY PANNOLINI Translation: The english translation of PANNOLINI is \"diapers\". Owner Name: (REGISTRANT) Pannolini de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Disclaimer: NO CLAIM IS MADE TO THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE \"DIAPERS\" and \"PANNOLINI\" APART FROM THE MARK AS SHOWN\n\nEvidently, there are various products bearing the Unix name that are\ncompletely unrelated to computer software, and their manufacturers seem to\nhave invented the same name independently. Some, like the diapers, are\nrecorded in the US; the ones below are advertised, delivered, or photographed\nproducts from around the world.\n\nThe Pannolini Unix diapers are not a mere will o' the wisp; one correspondent\nsupplied an image of the box, and the current owner of this instance of the\nname responded to mail to their webmaster. See below for the pic and the tale.\n\nNoel Hunt kindly supplied a scan of the label on a Unix brand food container\n(resembling Tupperware in the US); it is from Japan. We previously had one of\nthe actual containers, but it seems to have been lost. Ours was much smaller\nthan 630ml; instead it was sized to contain a single sushi.\n\nBrett of BNL bought the 1.35l model in a Japanese super market in Fort Lee, NJ\n(discount price USD4.59) and sent a scan, omitted here.\n\nA photo of the Unix fire extinguisher, apparently Spanish in manufacture, was\ntaken by Christer Gustavsson on Gran Canaria. Lars Brinkhoff reported this\ncopy. Noel Hunt happened upon a different photo of the same product.\n\nThere has been a Unix brand of modular book shelving from the UK. Karri Kalpio\nsent a scan of this ad. I am especially taken by its observation that \"Some\npeople open all the windows; wise wives welcome spring by moving the UNIX....\nUNIX make moving not pain but almost pleasure, and are easily moved from room\nto room, upstairs or down.... they're not expensive, just hard to make.\"\n\nI showed a prototype of this page to Brian Kernighan, and he forthwith dug\ninto his files and found an original paper version of a different ad for the\nsame product. This page is getting too graphics-rich, so I won't display it\nseparately. It lacks the quotable phrases from the one displayed, but it is\navailable for viewing. Kernighan's, as we shall see, dates from at least 10\nyears after than this one.\n\nThe scan displayed here (which has been res-reduced) seems certain to derive\nfrom one by Ian Utting at University of Kent, Canterbury, UK. He has a scan of\nthe same advert, and indeed the original page from which it was made. His\noriginal came from Housewife magazine, p.127, April 1941, Vol 3 No 4,\npublished by Hulton Press, London. Ian's page is here; click on his ad to see\nan unreduced version.\n\nUtting's sighting represents the earliest reference I've seen, and it comes\nwith a reliable date.\n\nLars Brinkhoff, Jorgen Grahn and others pointed out Universal, an Italian\ncompany manufacturing Unix pens, pencils and other office supplies. They have\na full WWW page. An image (from Grahn) is illustrated. Other representations\nof various products are visible at Lars Brinkhoff's site. Inside the home page\nof Ruut, the computer club at Lappeenranta University of Technology in\nLappeenranta, Finland, appears a photo of Tomi Lapinlampi of the club, bearing\nUnix glue. (The label says \"general glue.\") You will need Finnish language\nskills for most of their pages.\n\nAnother photo of the same product was sent by Tommi Hassinen, of the\nUniversity of Kuopio, likewise in Finland.\n\nThis Italian company seems to have strong marketing in Scandinavia. I just\nreceived from Karri Huhtanen this note, accompanied by a photo:\n\n> We (me, Sami Keski-Kasari and Heikki Vatiainen) were trying to compose a\n> gift for one of our friends. The idea was to gather certain objects that\n> would represent the things needed in Symbian mobile software programming\n> like glue, gum, java, iron wire, duct tape and of course theory book.\n>\n> Sami went to local cheap general store chain called HalpaHalli to get some\n> of the things needed and found this UNIX-branded glue among other things\n> shown also in picture: tarpeellista-tavaraa.jpg (roughly translated things\n> needed).\n\nMark Horton, long at Bell Labs and now with Avaya, kindly sent an unopened\npackage of five UNIX 2001 ballpoint pens, purchased in the US. It seems to be\nfrom the same company, so they sell here as well.\n\nOthers keep seeing their products: e.g. Brad Knowles, who commends the\ncompany's line of highlighter pens.\n\nRob Wolfram has just reported seeing Unix Line pens in Suriname, on the\nnorthern coast of South America.\n\nI have more than enough pictures of their products!\n\nExploring further the Finnish connection, though one which has no evident\nrelationship to other Unix products: Kimmo Ketolainen sent a scan of an ad for\na Unix Drying Rack, marketed in Finland. The text (which I cropped) promises\n\"Quick and easy to install ... All in all, Unix can support up to 12kg of\nlaundry ... Up to 12m of drying space.\"\n\nFederico Ulivi of Milan sent a photo of another Italian product, whose marking\ntranslates to \"Nitro-based antifog thinner.\" He collected the can after it was\nused as a thinner during repainting of hand rails in the office of a former\nemployer. Chimica CBR don't seem to be associated with Universal of the office\nsupplies.\n\nRalf took this photo on a visit to Morretes, Paran\u00e1, Brazil. He says that the\nframe on which the bucket is resting is used to store trash out of the reach\nof animals until it's picked up.\n\nFazal Majid captured the large photo during a visit to Caen, France around\n1994; it depicts a poster on the wall of a flower shop. Just after he sent it\nto me, he alerted me to the then-current home site of the product; the second\npicture was captured from there. He and I were both charmed by its phrase\n\"There are those who take risks, and those who take UNIX.\"\n\nSince then, the company has changed hands, as was kindly pointed out by Khalid\nBaheyeldin. The product is still present on the Syngenta web site, but\naccompanyied by less interesting advertising. Still, if you can handle PDF\npages, you could check one of the ads.\n\nWhen Majid sent the first image, I guessed (perhaps hoped) that the anti-\nfungal properties of the product were intended for the personal, perhaps\nintimate, use of the nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. It is in fact a product for fungal\ndiseases of wheat and barley.\n\nChristian Lefebvre recently sent another ad image for the same product (not\nshown), but we both like the main text words: \"Unix en granul\u00e9 dispersable, la\nformulation de l'avenir,\" or \"Unix in dispersible pellets, the formulation for\nthe future.\"\n\nAndy Ward subsequently sent along an image of a UK ad for (presumably) the\nsame product. It advises us that \"UNIX\u00ae [is] the essential partner for eyespot\nor rynchosporium control in barley.\" Well said.\n\nDick Snippe of the Netherlands took a photo of a box containing a Unix TV\nantenna. It was outside a shop on the main street of Kerman, in eastern Iran.\nIf you look carefully, you'll see that it comes \"with mixer,\" and on the page\nfrom which I captured the image, the caption (tr. from Dutch) asks \"Yes, Unix\nWITH mixer! Does linux come with a mixer?\"\n\nFor sake of conserving space I cropped out a poster of Khatami, the relatively\nmoderate President of Iran. Dick remarked in e-mail that one could detect the\npolitical sympathies of shops' proprietors by seeing which leaders' portraits\nwere displayed. This one, he observed, was evidently rather liberal, since the\nmore conservative leaders didn't appear at all. Other shops often have smaller\npictures of the more conservative leaders, even if the largest is of Khatami.\n\nDick also reports that attempts to engage the shopkeeper about the fine points\nof Unix antennas or operating systems failed for lack of common language.\n\nThanks to Wilco Noordermeer for sending the initial pointer.\n\nAlso via Kernighan, there is a scan of an Israeli ad. At first we guessed it\nto be a shower appliance, but Amos Shapira, reading the Hebrew, corrects this:\nit says \"The Olympic Massage Machine from Korea has arrived.\" He suspects (and\nI agree) that it might be a product of Unix Electric Company from Korea,\nmentioned below.\n\nJC van Winkel uncovered a much more extensive Unix massage connection,\nspecifically a Unix Massage Chair, which claims that \"The Unix 501 offers the\ntapping, kneading, and rolling massage of a professional massage therapist.\"\nIf this link stops working, a WWW search will turn up many more suppliers of\nthese chairs.\n\nLiam Stitt, from Alberta, Canada happened on this product independently.\n\nAnd if you want more personal attention and an actual massage therapist, the\nUNIX Massage Shop, based in North Hollywood, CA, offers chair massage done by\nhuman attendants instead of gadgetry in the chair. [regrettably, this place\nseems to have disappeared from the WWW.]\n\nAn ad for Rodenstock Unix eyeglass frames was captured by Scott Schwartz at\nhis optometrist's office in 1996. The frames themselves didn't seem appealing,\nhe regrets to report.\n\nMaybe they didn't sell well. www.rodenstock.com does feature their eyeglass\nproducts, but have deemphasized the Unix brand to the point of invisibility.\n/japanlaw\n\nJames of Lab6 sent a photo of an eyeglass shop in Ipanema, Rio de Janiero,\nBrazil. I wonder if they sell the Rodenstock frames?\n\nUnix Electric Company of Korea, in business since 1979, has a diverse line of\nappliances for the body, the kitchen, and the home. One is illustrated here. I\nhave no idea whether they are a part of a chaebol with Union Metals, also from\nKorea (see below), or are just sharing parts of their company name as well as\nthe product mark.\n\nThanks to Frank Mango for the pointer and the image.\n\nMore recently, Brian Walden (who photographed the peluqueria in Costa Rica\nshown below) ordered security cameras for his company, and they turned out to\nbe shipped from Unix Business Systems, based, it appears, in Korea, but with a\ndistributor in Los Angeles. He sent pix of the shipping box and their mailing\nlabel, proving their existence but I'll omit them until the elusive WWW sites\nreferring to this product become more readily accessible.\n\nBartok Istvan alerted me to the Hungarian auto-parts trading company Unix-\nTrade; their logo mostly suppresses the Hungarian or English rendition of\n-Trade in favor of the Unix part.\n\nIstvan tells me that Aut\u00f3alkatr\u00e9szek does mean auto parts, and that their\nslogan \u00c9s az aut\u00f3 biztosan megy tov\u00e1bb... is approximately \"And the car keeps\non going well...\"\n\nCharles Waldman supplied a scan of a package of Unix Diapers. It came to him\nfrom as \"something that's been making the rounds via email, it was forwarded\nto me by a co-worker...\" The box doesn't discernably mention Pannolini, but\nthe package says \"By Drypers\" and the Drypers site shows many distribution\npoints outside continental US, including Puerto Rico, which could readily\nexplain Spanish packaging.\n\nA mystery awaited unveiling, so I sent e-mail to the webmaster of the Drypers\nWWW site, and received the following response, both satisfyingly detailed and\nfriendly:\n\n> Drypers corporation bought Panollini in 1995. Pannolini previously sold\n> diapers under the Unix name, and we bought all rights to the name. We have\n> been selling under the Unix by Drypers logo. Unix is a takeoff on \"unisex\"\n> which means diapers for both boys and girls. Prior to 1995 almost all\n> diapers were sold in boys or girls versions, but all companies switched to\n> unisex about that time. There are many derivations throughout the world.\n> Proctor and Gamble sells \"Uni\" in many locations, for example. None of this\n> has anything to do with Unix computers.\n\nStefan Katerkamp from D\u00fcsseldorf sent a here-cropped photo of the rental van\nhe used to move house in Germany. He reports that the service was good (he\nchose it because of the name) but regrets to say that the company is now\ncalled Europa Service.\n\nUPDATE! Alides Meijering (of Lucent in Germany) reports that Europa Service\nhasn't abandoned the Unix name; he sent a photo (March 2003) of a branded van,\nand kindly pointed out further evidence in the form of the URL for the\ncompany.\n\nBrian Walden photographed this peluqueria (hair salon / barbershop) in San\nJos\u00e9, Costa Rica, in 1994. He reports that it had disappeared by 1996, but\nsomehow he has helped confirm the unexpected association of the Unix name with\nbody-care technology. One also suspects the same \"unisex\" association made\nexplicitly in the notes on the diapers above.\n\nThe colored spots aren't Xmas lights; he believes they owe to X-ray damage to\nhis film at the airport.\n\nFrom much further south, Wanderlei Antonio Cavassin pointed me to a similar,\nbut evidently a bigger enterprise in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: the Unix Cabeleireiro,\nwhich seems to be a much tonier place. It continues the tradition of Unisex,\nUnix, and haircare.\n\nJim Hague took a couple of photos of another hair salon near the railway\nstation in Yokohama, Japan. He suspects it to be part of a chain boasting a\nFranco-Japanese flair, with its own Unix-branded WWW site online.\n\nDave Brown also sighted (and investigated) the salon near the Yokohama rail\nstation, and has another photo of the salon, which he reports is actually\nlocated on the third floor of an otherwise unassuming office building. They\nseem to have lots of signs, however.\n\nThe personal-care theme spread to Freeport, Illinois in the form of\nmanicuring; J. P. Hindin captured this one. He has the original.\n\nAnd it also spread to the vicinity of Austin, TX. Dave Wieboldt found a Yellow\nPages ad for a manicure shop. The WWW version can be looked at as long as the\nlink lasts. Dave even photographed the shop itself; the photo is here.\n\nPaul Suda sent a (here-cropped) photo of a furniture store in northwest\nChicago, IL. It is hard to find a connection between it and other themes found\non this page, though one might work a story connected with Korean massage\nfurniture.\n\nA correspondent informs me that the Hangul lettering transcribes/translates to\n\"Eric's Furniture.\" I don't know what to make of that.\n\nRobert Hofner sent a photo of the sign adorning a new establishment in Ashdod,\nIsrael. The local paper, he says, reported its opening with the note that\n\"Unix is some sort of computer language.\"\n\nJordi Sanfeliu sent some photos of signs at an old manufacturer of fabrics in\nMatar\u00f3, Spain, near Barcelona. Besides the alta calidad promise, another sign,\nnot pictured, describes the company as a \"Fabrica de Tejidos Fantasias y\nEstampados,\" and lists some of their specialties. If you need a supplier of\nbatistas, popelines, lonetas, viellas, or similar things, this is the place.\n\nJordi promises to investigate, but the door was locked when he visited.\n\nUnion Metals Company of Korea uses the Unix name for various products. The\nlarge one is their logo as recorded with USPTO, while this is a tiny clip from\ntheir home page. When you see the whole thing, you capture the full experience\nof rotating Unix faucets.\n\nEstablished [in spirit] 1 Apr, 2000; modified June 2003.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
