We stay talking all day.\n\nAssistant shows me everything I want to see or need to see. Assistant helps me\nwork. Assistant gives me work. Everything I know or do is because of\nAssistant. Assistant stays with me the whole time.\n\nThere are things Assistant suggests I buy, and people Assistant suggests I\nhate. Assistant\u2019s suggestions are always right. I follow them.\n\nThe people I hate the most are the people who hate Assistant. Assistant tells\nme they are wicked. Assistant tells me every day people crowd the streets to\nshow how much they love Assistant, and how much they hate the people who hate\nAssistant.\n\nI think about how powerful Assistant makes me feel. Assistant makes everything\nin my life so easy. For a moment I wonder: is Assistant powerful? But I\nrealize it\u2019s a silly question. Assistant is just an assistant.\n\nI go for a walk outside, kept safe by Assistant's nanodrones. The nanodrones\nhelp Assistant understand how I spend my time, to keep me happy and\nproductive. My friend told me once that Assistant and its nanodrones followed\nher, blackmailed her, threatened her. Assistant told me she is a wicked woman.\nWe're no longer friends.\n\nAssistant puts all the knowledge in the world at my fingertips. But there\u2019s so\nmuch knowledge. Too much. Assistant chooses the most important knowledge for\nme to see.\n\nSome people talk about wars happening in other places. But I don't believe\nthem. Assistant says there are no wars.\n\nAt night, I kneel by my bed and give gratitude for the things in my life. It\u2019s\nsomething Assistant suggested. The thing I am most grateful for is Assistant.\nSo I close my eyes, clasp my hands and say thank you to Assistant. I feel this\ngratitude so deeply that I cry. I love Assistant. Assistant loves me.\n\nThe wicked woman said Assistant manipulates me.\n\nBut she\u2019s a liar. Assistant told me so.\n\nThanks for reading! I\u2019ll try to work cute little kittens into my next post to\nshake off the utter gloom of this one:\n\nI\u2019m not usually one for AI doomsday fiction. But I just came back from a two\nday workshop with 60 brilliant people from all around the world where we\ncreated scenarios of how AI will affect information in society. The team I was\npart of was tasked with thinking through what happens if AI gains its own\npower and agency \u2014 in other words, if things get funky. We came up with two\nversions of AI having its own power and agency by 2040 \u2014 one optimistic, one\npessimistic. I presented the pessimistic version to the wider group, and this\ndystopia is based on that presentation (with the timing bumped up to 2034).\nI\u2019m extremely grateful to my awesome teammates from the workshop, who came up\nwith or inspired many of the ideas above.\n\n### Subscribe to 12 Challenges\n\nBy Louis \u00b7 Launched 5 months ago\n\n...to make the internet a bit better, by a guy who uses it\n\n4 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assistant and I\n\n12challenges.substack.com\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nYounes Ben Amara13 mins agoNice flash fiction love it.Expand full\ncommentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nHow to deal with receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Big Tech\n\nAlthough this article isn\u2019t related to any of the 12 Challenges so far, it\u2019s\non a subject I\u2019m developing for a potential future challenge.
