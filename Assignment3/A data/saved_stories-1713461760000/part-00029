From the hour-long daily standup to the\ncarefully choreographed sprint demo, so much business value is unlocked and\nthe best part is that becoming a certified expert only takes two days.\n\nAgile started with the best of intentions, but now we've got consultants\ntaking liberties with stuff like \"story point normalisation\" and \"design\nsprints\". We've got to Make Agile Great Again, and it all starts with a\nhilarious card game!\n\nCards Against Agility is a card game based on that format you know & love, but\ntaking aim specifically at the nonsense of 'Capital A' Agile. This game won't\nmake sense outside of the tech industry... but if you\u2019re an Agile fan, you\u2019ll\nenjoy it, and if you\u2019re a cynic like us, you\u2019ll absolutely love it.\n\n# How to play\n\nAs we know, Agile is mostly about knowing which contrived terms to use for\nbasic concepts, and so as you\u2019d expect, Cards Against Agility cargo cults that\napproach.\n\n  * Cards Against Agility consists of Epics (statement cards) and User Stories (answer cards).\n  * The game is played by Resources (people). No individual names, job titles, or pronouncements of seniority should be assigned to Resources.\n  * Resources take it in turns to be Scrum Master, who is in charge of delivering an Epic on time and on budget.\n  * A game of Cards Against Agility is called a Sprint. Each Sprint is time-boxed to 15 minutes.\n  * Each Resource plays a User Story to complete the Epic.\n  * The Scrum Master picks a winner, and the winning Resource scores 3 points (i.e. the score the Product Owner believes every Epic should be.)\n  * The Sprint concludes with the Sprint Retrospective, wherein the Scrum Master adds up the total points from the game and announces: \"Great game, everyone! Julie won this Sprint the [score] points. You achieved [total] as a team, so let's make a commitment to [total+5] in the next sprint.\"\n\n# The game itself\n\nCards Against Agility is printed by a specialist card game printer, on casino-\ngrade 320gsm linen finish triple-ply cards with a plastic coating. That means\nthe cards are extremely durable, and have a nice weight for idle fiddling\nduring a long and boring meeting.\n\nThe game contains 60 questions and 140 answers, which usually yields a 15 to\n30 minute game for 3 or 4 people, depending on your velocity. You can get away\nwith 2 players, and could probably stretch up to about 10 players before there\nare too few User Stories to keep all resources at maximum utilisation.\n\nView full details\n\n## Subscribe to our emails\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n\nPayment methods\n\n\u00a9 2024, Agile Supplies Powered by Shopify\n\n  * Choosing a selection results in a full page refresh.\n  * Opens in a new window.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
