The intercepts cover a 24 hour period surrounding the\nSeptember 11, 2001 attacks in New York and Washington.\n\nThe messages are being broadcast \"live\" to the global community \u2014 sychronized\nto the time of day they were sent. The first message is from 3AM September 11,\n2001, five hours before the first attack, and the last, 24 hours later.\n\nText pagers are usualy carried by persons operating in an official capacity.\nMessages in the archive range from Pentagon, FBI, FEMA and New York Police\nDepartment exchanges, to computers reporting faults at investment banks inside\nthe World Trade Center\n\nThe archive is a completely objective record of the defining moment of our\ntime. We hope that its entrance into the historical record will lead to a\nnuanced understanding of how this event led to death, opportunism and war.\n\nAn index of messages released so far is available here.\n\nTwitter users may use the hashtag #911txts. We will give status updates at\ntwitter.com/wikileaks.\n\nLast 12 intercept collections:\n\n2001.09.12 02.55 to 2001.09.12 02.59 (text) 2001.09.12 02.50 to 2001.09.12\n02.54 (text) 2001.09.12 02.45 to 2001.09.12 02.49 (text) 2001.09.12 02.40 to\n2001.09.12 02.44 (text) 2001.09.12 02.35 to 2001.09.12 02.39 (text) 2001.09.12\n02.30 to 2001.09.12 02.34 (text) 2001.09.12 02.25 to 2001.09.12 02.29 (text)\n2001.09.12 02.20 to 2001.09.12 02.24 (text) 2001.09.12 02.15 to 2001.09.12\n02.19 (text) 2001.09.12 02.10 to 2001.09.12 02.14 (text) 2001.09.12 02.05 to\n2001.09.12 02.09 (text) 2001.09.12 02.00 to 2001.09.12 02.04 (text)\n\nPlease remember to protect and support our work.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
