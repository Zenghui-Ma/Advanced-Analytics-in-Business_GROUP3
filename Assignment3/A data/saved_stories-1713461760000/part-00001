You keepin' it real?\" You\nwere actually composing faux-Chaucer poems in your head, which seems like a\nmarginal-at-best level of connection to reality. In desperation, you remember\na piece of social skills advice you saw on r/greentexts, where you imagine\nwhat a hypothetical cooler version of yourself would say, then say that. You\nsimulate the hypothetical cooler version of yourself. It says: \"Real as an\neel, sister!\", then saunters off cockily. You decide to ignore all social\nskills advice from now on. Instead, you mumble something incomprehensible and\ndesperately try to change the topic.\n\n\"How is your ... \" You strain your memory, then it comes to you. \"...automated\nland acknowledger?\" That's right, last time you talked to her she was working\non an Amazon-Echo-like device that you could leave in your home and workplace.\nAt programmable intervals, it would read a canned message acknowledging you\nwere on Native land.\n\nShe laughs. \"It's funny! I met this Native American guy at a conference, and\nhe said it was an offensive piece of tokenist crap that made no material\ndifference in the lives of the oppressed!\"\n\nYou nod glumly. \"Yeah, none of us wanted to be the one to tell you.\"\n\n\"...but it's fine! Cause I started thinking, how can we make a material\ndifference in the lives of the oppressed, and now we've got an even better\nproduct. Landulgences! We've partnered with local Indian tribes to let you pay\nthem rent. You pay them about $0.10 per square foot per year, they give you a\ncertificate saying you're welcome to use their land during that time.\"\n\n\"I thought the whole idea was that we had stolen the land, so it's not theirs\nanymore.\"\n\n\"Yes, but if we hadn't stolen the land, you would pay them rent. So if you're\nagainst stealing the land, you can make it as if you didn't steal it, by\npaying them the rent you believe they're due. Isn't it great? We're especially\nworking on advertising to corporations. Imagine. Your top customer goes to\nyour competitor's meeting, and hear 'We acknowledge that this office building\nstands on the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone tribe, which we have stolen\nbecause we are evil colonizers.' Then they go to your meeting, and hear 'This\nbuilding stands on the land of the Ohlone, who we've come to a mutually\nbeneficial agreement with. Their chief sent us a thank-you letter for being\nsuch good tenants, you can see it in the break room.' Which one of you seems\nmore trustworthy?\"\n\n\u201cThis is the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone people! Buy a landulgence\nfor as low as $4.99 your first month\" chirps the Land Acknowledger, behind\nher.\n\n\"I thought you said that was offensive and tokenist\", you say.\n\n\"I said it would have been, without the landuldgences! Now it's a part of our\nhorizontally integrated product strategy!\"\n\nYou feel like you should say something, but it is an improvement. And you want\nto stay on her good side, because maybe next time you see her she\u2019ll be a\nbillionaire. So you wish her good luck and take your leave.\n\nYou see a familiar t-shirt and recognize The Burrowing Company guy. Now that\nwas a cool, ambitious plan. You make a beeline for him. \u201cHey, how are the\ngiant ground sloths?\u201d\n\n\u201cLazy,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI guess we should have predicted. But they hate digging\ntunnels. They just want to hang around all day. We\u2019ve got to pivot or die.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what are you thinking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI worry this is kind of offensive,\u201d he says, furtively looking around to make\nsure nobody else can hear. \u201cBut I was reading this article about how Hamas dug\n350 miles of tunnels under Gaza. Meanwhile, Elon\u2019s Boring Company has only dug\nabout 3 miles of tunnel in its whole corporate existence. So I\u2019m thinking,\nmaybe we forget about the ground sloths and try to poach Hamas\u2019 people. It\nshould be pretty easy; the smart ones have got to be looking for new jobs\naround now. We change the name to something more culturally appropriate like\nThe Buraj Company. Then we\u2019re back in business!\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t there be visa issues with trying to get lots of terrorists into the\nUS?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople make the whole visa thing sound harder than it is. You\u2019ve just got to\nprove there\u2019s no American worker who can do the job you\u2019re hiring the\nforeigner for. Looking at the history of US tunneling in the past thirty\nyears, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the giant ground sloths?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure something out. Do you know if sloths are halal?\u201d\n\nYou elect not to answer that question, and move on. There\u2019s a circle of people\nall sitting and talking. After you join, you notice something wrong about the\natmosphere. Did you accidentally stumble into an AI Circle or Urbanist Coven\nagain? No. You realize with sinking heart that this is one of those\nconversations where everybody compares their jobs to see who is the coolest.\n\n\u201cI work for Stop Talking About Taylor Swift Magazine,\u201d says a man in his mid-\ntwenties. \u201cIt\u2019s the #1 publication for people who want to stop hearing about\nTaylor Swift all the time. We carry monthly features on why Taylor\u2019s music,\nschedule, personal life, and wardrobe are all less important than other things\nand don\u2019t deserve the level of attention they\u2019ve been getting.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to interrupt, but you can\u2019t help asking: \u201cWould the kind of\nperson who wants to stop hearing about Taylor Swift really be into a magazine\nlike that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re the third-best-selling women\u2019s magazine in the\nUnited States at this point. Our only regret is that we\u2019re not as popular with\nthe male demographic. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working on launching a new spinoff,\nStop Paying Attention To The Marvel Cinematic Universe. We just signed our\nfirst big contract; Freddie de Boer will be writing 600 articles for us over\nthe next three years.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates his worth as a human being - he writes for a\nmagazine! pretty cool! - and the metaphorical conch shell passes to the next\nperson in the circle, a young woman in round-rimmed glasses and a bright red\nt-shirt saying WUHAN INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY - SCIENCE THAT REPLICATES.\n\n\u201cI run QRiosity, a browser with native QR code support. Just click on a QR\nimage, and it will take you to the website!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, like links, but worse?\u201d someone asks.\n\n\u201cLike links, but not deboosted on social media. X and the rest are pulling\nevery trick they know to prevent you from leaving their walled garden. Now the\ncustomer is getting some tricks of their own to fight back. Next we\u2019re working\non implanting QR codes in videos, so your links can get maximal algorithmic\nboosting.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates her worth as a human being - it\u2019s a good product\nidea! - and moves on to the next person, a clean-cut blonde man in a black\npolo shirt.\n\n\u201cI work for the Threads Of Life Foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, every so\noften billionaires and journalists condemn effective altruists because, like,\nwhat if they give poor people malaria nets, and then those poor people use\nthem for fishing, and it hurts the fish. And people like to say \u201coh, those\nbillionaires and journalists never care about fish in any other context\u201d and\n\u201cobviously this is just incredibly blatant cope so they can feel morally\nsuperior for not donating to charity\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s pretty crazy that our\nobsession with \u2018harm\u2019 and \u2018the precautionary principle\u2019 has gone so far that\nif you save millions of people but also kill a few fish, the establishment\nunites in painting you as a villain for not considering the fish deaths.\u2019 But\nthat didn\u2019t seem charitable to me. I thought \u2018No, I bet these are actually\ngood people, who have a little trouble empathizing with human suffering, or\nwith any-animal-except-fish suffering, or with fish suffering in 99.9% of\ncontexts - but for some reason, they feel absolutely devastated at the thought\nof a fish getting caught in a bednet given to a poor person by a charity for\nthe express purpose of saving their lives. That poor fish, stuck in those tiny\nlittle insecticide-laced threads, writhing around! These people don\u2019t need our\nmockery - they need to unite and stand up for the suspiciously-specific thing\nthey believe in!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I started Threads Of Life. We\u2019re a charity dedicated to preventing\nfish from getting caught in repurposed malaria nets. We send hundreds of\nmonitors to rivers all across Africa. They seek out locations where net\nfishing is going on, take samples of discarded nets, use chemical testing to\nmatch them to brands of malaria net given out by charities. Then if they find\na match, they find the offending fisherman, cut his remaining nets, and free\nthe fish. It\u2019s tough work, but the outpouring of support we\u2019ve gotten has made\nit all worth it. A bigshot AI venture capitalist recently donated half his\nfortune to us. A Stanford professor, when he heard about our work, pledged\ngive us 10% of his paltry academic income every year from then on, just\nbecause he believed in our cause.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really inspiring. But there\u2019s so much work still to be done! I\u2019ve\nsurveyed our donors and found that there are lots of other causes they care\nabout too, like birds getting caught in wind turbines built to provide\nrenewable energy, or people\u2019s views being ruined by solar plants. I\u2019m meeting\nan ethologist next week to see if we can breed strains of birds with\ngenetically-implanted windmill avoidance patterns. Is this an effective use of\nresources? No. Does it address one of the tiny number of extremely specific\nconcerns which, if we were to treat our donors\u2019 engagement with the concept of\n\u2018charity\u2019 as an honest expression of their revealed preferences, receive\noverwhelming multipliers in their utility functions? Absolutely!\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates his worth as a human being, and he is found\nacceptable - he works with venture capitalists! We move on to the next person,\na middle-aged woman in a loose dress.\n\n\u201cI work on meta-planning-applications for the city of London,\u201d she says. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re trying to repair a bridge or something, you can\u2019t just send out\nengineers like you\u2019re in the Wild West or something. You have to do an\nenvironmental impact report, to make sure that the repair won\u2019t harm the\nenvironment, or threaten communities, or take place in an inequitable way.\nThese applications have grown bigger and bigger over the past few decades, so\nthat the most recent one, for the Lower Thames Crossing, took fifteen years,\ninvolved 2,383 separate documents, and ran to 359,000 pages. Imagine how many\nharms a planning application that big could cause! That\u2019s why the government\ninstituted the meta-planning-application. Now if you want to make a planning\napplication like the Thames one, you start by applying for a meta-planning-\napplication. Our department makes sure that the paper for your hundreds of\nthousands of pages will come from sustainably sourced timber, and that the\ndozens of planning bureaucrats you hire will be sufficiently diverse.\n\n\u201cNow, I know what you\u2019re going to say - don\u2019t you need a meta-meta-planning\napplication to start the meta-planning application? Isn\u2019t it an infinite\nregress? Ha ha. Like we haven\u2019t heard that one a thousand times. But no, the\nmeta-planning application is a much simpler affair than the planning\napplication. We\u2019ve set a goal that it shouldn\u2019t take a team of ten people more\nthan a year, and it shouldn\u2019t run to more than 10,000 pages. So we let you\nmeta-apply for an application without any previous layers of permission.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates her worth as a human being - she does, in some\nsense, contribute to the building of infrastructure - and moves on to the next\nperson. He looks to be in his mid-twenties, dressed in a finely-tailored suit.\nHe wears a watch with enough diamonds on it that it has to cost low-six-\nfigures, at least. He leans on his date, who appears to be some kind of\nsupermodel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a retired photographer,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Threads of Life guy asks the question all of you are thinking: \u201cHow do you\nmake enough money, as a photographer, to retire to a life of luxury in your\nmid-20s?\u201d\n\n\u201cI took that one picture of Elon Musk where he\u2019s scowling and steepling his\nfingers in a sinister, manipulative-looking way. Since then it\u2019s been the\nheadline image for every story on Elon Musk, and I\u2019ve gotten royalties for all\nof them.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates his worth as a human being, realizes he is the\nmost successful person in the room, and slinks off. As the circle disperses,\nyou head to the kitchen. There\u2019s still a few slices of cold pizza. One other\nguy is eating at the counter. You pull up a chair beside him. \u201cCan I sit\nhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re kind of taken aback. \u201cIs it something I said earlier?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you know that saying that\u2019s become popular recently? \u2018If\nthere\u2019s a Nazi at the table, and ten people sitting and willingly eating\nalongside him, then you have 11 Nazis.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOkaaaaay,\u201d you say. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Nazi.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re a Nazi,\u201d he corrected. \u201cBut if you take the saying\nliterally, then anybody who\u2019s every sat down at a table with a Nazi is a Nazi.\nAnd anyone who\u2019s ever sat down at a table with them is a Nazi, and anyone\nwho\u2019s ever sat down at a table with them is a Nazi too, and so on. It\u2019s a six\ndegrees of separation problem. When you actually calculate it out, then as\nlong as the average person sits and eats with at least two people during their\nlifetime, there\u2019s a 99.9998% chance everyone is a Nazi. The only way out is to\nrefuse to ever sit and eat with anyone. Which is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nYou see his face from a different angle, and something snaps into place. \u201cHey,\naren\u2019t you @DanielC35801 from Twitter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you tweet a couple of days ago that the Jews should be driven into the\nsea?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was part of the fight against settler colonialism, so it\u2019s different,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cAlso, I said you couldn\u2019t sit here. Go away.\u201d\n\nYou take your slice of cold pizza and walk into the living room. You take a\nseat at the little coffee table, opposite a shaven-headed man with the Generic\nCircle-y Startup Logo tshirt. \u201cHey,\u201d you say. \u201cI saw you a couple minutes ago\nwhen everyone was talking about their jobs. I guess you didn\u2019t get a chance to\ngo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sucks, because I think I have the best job of anyone\nhere. I started a company that uses diphyllic polymers for dam construction.\nDiphyllic polymer is a new material that strengthens when it encounters water.\nYou can just pour a truck full into a river, and get a dam in a fraction of\nthe time for half the price.\u201d\n\nYou took a course that touched on diphyllic polymer once, so for once you\u2019re\nnot a total rube. \u201cHey, I know a little about that! I thought it turned\nbrittle and fractured below about 36 degrees F. Aren\u2019t you concerned that your\ndams might break during a cold spell?\u201d\n\nThe dam guy looks at you blankly for a second. Then it\u2019s as if a light goes on\nin his eyes: \u201cOh, I see! You\u2019re one of those people who thinks technology\nmakes the world worse! You should read this great essay - it\u2019s called The\nTechno-Optimist Manifesto. You\u2019ll see that actually, throughout human history,\ntechnology has made the world better!\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree that technology is good in general,\u201d you say. \u201cI just thought I heard\nthat this particular technology might shatter once the temperature reaches 36\ndegrees F, and then it would flood anywhere downstream of the dam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you could hear yourself,\u201d said the dam guy. \u201cIt\u2019s like - a hundred\nyears ago people said we shouldn\u2019t use antibiotics, because only God should be\nallowed to heal people. And then fifty years ago, people said we shouldn\u2019t use\nnuclear power, because it might have meltdowns and kill us all. And now you\u2019re\nsaying we can\u2019t make diphyllic dams. Doesn\u2019t it worry you to be part of this\nlong line of people trying to hold back the Promethean spirit of the human\nrace?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally for Promethean spirit!\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s just - yes or no, does\ndiphyllite shatter at 36 degrees F?\u201d\n\nDam guy starts to look really frustrated. \u201cYou know, Tyler Cowen has a saying:\n\u2018Either you\u2019re a Builder, or you\u2019re a Nervous Nellie: take your pick.\u2019 Well,\nI\u2019m going to create monuments that advance the glory of civilization and\ngenerate hydroelectricity and push humanity into a beautiful future. I think\nthat makes me a Builder. And you might think you\u2019re so profound, being a\nNervous Nellie over there, but Tyler Cowen says that Nervous Nellies are just\noverindulging in their own neuroticism and don\u2019t have any profound wisdom at\nall. Like, what have you ever built, Nellie?\u201d\n\nYou are pretty sure you have irreparably offended Dam Guy. Also, people are\nstarting to stare at you. What if you get a reputation as a someone who hates\nprogress, and never get invited to any more cool Bay Area house parties? What\nwas that social advice you vowed never to take a few minutes ago? Oh, right.\nImagine what a much cooler person would do, then do that thing.\n\nYou hand Dam Guy a business card from your wallet - it\u2019s your dentist\u2019s, but\nhe doesn\u2019t know that. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019m actually a bigshot VC.\nI was just testing you to make sure you weren\u2019t a Nervous Nellie. You\u2019ve\npassed with flying colors. I\u2019d like to invest in your company at an absurdly\nhigh valuation.\u201d\n\nHis face fills with sudden delight. \u201cHoly s***! This is what I\u2019ve always\ndreamed of! Are you for real?\u201d\n\n\u201cReal as an eel, brother!\u201d you say, and saunter off cockily. Or maybe not. You\ncan\u2019t remember whether a saunter is supposed to be more like a walk, a jog, or\na run. Mostly you just want to be out of there.\n\nThus having cleverly escaped a fight Our Pilgrim saunters out into the night\nAbandoning the bustle of the square To drink a draught of cool and foggy air\nThen, having filled his head with wild schemes He seeks his bed, for warm and\npleasant dreams\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n29 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n29\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Ye Olde Bay Area House Party\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n10\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### Ye Olde Bay Area House Party\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n10 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\nMedieval Cat59 mins ago>WUHAN INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY - SCIENCE THAT REPLICATESI\nneed this t-shirt now!Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nAndrew Currall56 mins agoI probably wrote a couple of those Lower Thames\nCrossing documents; I worked on it for a year or so back in around 2012.Expand\nfull commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMaxS54 mins agoNever stop with these, please.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nGraham CunninghamSlouching Towards Bethlehem48 mins agoI was at that party\n(the pink and green hair?).... didn't see you there though.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nCesare G.
