According to the FAA, the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM),\nissued in August 2023, was prompted by a determination that the loss of a\nground through the P6 panel results in the failure of the SPCU.\n\nPhoto: Unaccompanied Media | Shutterstock\n\nThe FAA warned that a failure of the SPCU and ground through the P6 panel can\npotentially result in a significant loss of flight crew instrumentation and\ndisplays, leading to a safety risk. As a result, the regulator mandated that\noperators install two bonding jumpers from the P6 panel structure to the\nprimary structure.\n\nHowever, the FAA estimated that only 79 Boeing 737 MAX 8 or MAX 9 aircraft in\nthe US are affected by the directive. According to the FAA, the estimated\ncosts to adhere to the AD were $435 per aircraft, split between $255 labor and\n$180 part-related expenses.\n\nRelated\n\n##### When Immediate Action Is Required: 5 Things You Need To Know About\nEmergency Airworthiness Directives\n\nThere are some key differences between regular airworthiness directives and\nemergency directives.\n\n## Changes to the background information of the AD\n\nThree companies, as well as a trio of individuals, commented on the directive.\nWhile United Airlines supported the NPRM without change, Boeing requested the\nFAA to change the background section of the proposed rulemaking. The plane\nmaker asked the regulator to clarify two points, namely that a single point of\nfailure condition would result in the failure of the SPCU. Furthermore,\n\n> \u201c[...] the loss of SPCU function, in combination with other lost P6\n> functions, could result in a potentially confusing combination of flight\n> deck effects and lost functionality. Boeing stated that the additional\n> information would clarify and add detail to expand to other additional\n> equipment in the P6.\u201d\n\nThe FAA responded that while it agreed with the suggestions, the background\nsection published in the NPRM was not repeated in the final rule AD. As such,\nit made no editorial changes to the directive, publishing it into the public\ndomain on April 17.\n\nRelated\n\n##### When Immediate Action Is Required: 5 Things You Need To Know About\nEmergency Airworthiness Directives\n\nThere are some key differences between regular airworthiness directives and\nemergency directives.\n\n## Calls to ground the Boeing 737 MAX\n\nHowever, the Foundation for Aviation Safety and three individuals pleaded with\nthe FAA to ground the type. In a brief response, the FAA said that the\ncorrective actions by the directive will address the unsafe condition, which\ndoes not warrant an order to prohibit further Boeing 737 MAX operations.\n\nIn a separate filing, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, led by Ed Pierson,\nthe executive director of the foundation, said that the P6 circuit breaker\npanel provides circuit breakers for many of the 737 MAX\u2019s most critical\nelectrical systems.\n\n> \u201cBoeing leadership was made aware of the potential for electrical defects\n> stemming from rushed production and engineering quality issues in the 737\n> factory as early as the spring of 2018, when chronic problems with\n> electrical systems testing were reported to Boeing\u2019s 737 General Manager in\n> June 2018 and to Boeing\u2019s CEO, General Counsel and Board of Directors in Feb\n> 2019.\u201d\n\nAccording to the foundation, another serious electrical bonding and grounding\nproblem was found involving the P6 panel and the SPCU in April 2021. It\nprevented the engines from starting, with the issue coming to light just five\nmonths after the 737 MAX was ungrounded following the two fatal crashes with\nthe type, resulting in many changes to the aircraft and the FAA\u2019s regulations.\n\nPhoto: Boeing\n\nNevertheless, The Foundation for Aviation Safety questioned the fact that\nSteve Dickson, the then-FAA Administrator, called the 737 MAX \u201cthe most\nheavily scrutinized transport aircraft in aviation history.\u201d The foundation\nrhetorically asked how exhaustive this process was if two serious electrical\nproblems affecting flight instruments and engines were not discovered while\nthe FAA scrutinized the aircraft.\n\n> \u201cSince being ungrounded, MAX airplanes continue to exhibit large numbers of\n> unexplained electrical malfunctions. This is a dangerous unresolved issue\n> that will not be resolved by fixing this latest electrical problem with the\n> MAX. The Foundation for Aviation Safety believes the MAX airplane needs to\n> be grounded indefinitely.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\n##### FAA Administrator Steve Dickson Steps Down From Role\n\nThe FAA chief was just half way through his five year term.\n\n## Grounding issue affecting 737 MAX engine ice protection\n\nIn April 2021, the FAA published another directive related to the P6 panel,\nthe mounting tray for the SPCU, and the main instrument panel (MIP) assembly.\nAt the time, the regulator explained that it had received a report about an\nelectrical bonding and grounding issue on a Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft. The\ndirective affected 71 aircraft in the US, with the regulator adopting the\ndirective immediately, saying that Boeing had recommended operators to ground\nthe affected 737 MAXs.\n\nThe FAA said that an investigation identified insufficient bonding of specific\nmetallic support panel assemblies installed in two areas of the flight deck,\naffecting the electrical grounding of installed equipment. The bonding issues\ncropped up after \u201cdesign changes,\u201d which were absent prior.\n\nPhoto: Marco Menezes | Shutterstock\n\nAs a result, while no in-service failures of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 or MAX 9 had\nbeen recorded, the FAA warned that without dedicated grounding paths, the\nexisting uncontrolled ground paths could degrade or be lost completely,\npotentially affecting,\n\n> \u201c[...] the operation of certain systems, including engine ice protection,\n> and result in loss of critical functions and/or multiple simultaneous flight\n> deck effects, which may prevent continued safe flight and landing.\u201d\n\nEd Pierson was one of the four witnesses speaking in front of the US Senate\nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The subcommittee launched an inquiry\ninto Boeing after a whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a current quality engineer\nat Boeing, alleged manufacturing deficiencies with the Boeing 777 and 787\nprograms. The plane maker denied the allegations, telling Simple Flying that\nthe claims about any structural problems related to the 787 are \u201cinaccurate\u201d\nin a statement on April 15.\n\nRelated\n\n##### Whistleblower Report Prompts Closer Look At Boeing 787 Dreamliner\nProgram\n\nBoeing denied the allegations made by the whistleblower, including those\nrelated to potential 787 issues.\n\nComments\n\nShare Share Share Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nShare Share Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Aviation News\n  * Boeing News\n  * North America\n  * Boeing 737 Max\n  * Boeing\n  * FAA\n  * airworthiness directive\n  * united states\n\nAbout The Author\n\nRytis Beresnevi\u010dius (527 Articles Published)\n\nRytis joins the Simple Flying team with more than two and a half years of\nexperience reporting on the aviation industry.
