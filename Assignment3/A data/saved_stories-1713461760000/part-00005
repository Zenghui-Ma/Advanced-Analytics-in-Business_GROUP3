Here\u2019s how to adapt.\n\n  * Brand Strategy, Featured\n\n  * May 15, 2023\n\nSix years ago, I shared my 16 Rules of Brand Strategy, a list of tenets to\nbuild or test your company\u2019s strategy. That article went viral and is still\nreferenced today more than any of my other pieces. But consumers and culture\nhave changed a great deal, so it\u2019s time to write some new rules.\n\nConsider the original 16 rules to be the cost of entry. They are now the\nbaseline requirement for brand building. This new and revamped list is how you\nbuild on that foundation and level up to greatness.\n\nYou will quickly see that these rules are not only valuable for brands but can\n(and should) inform product, UX, sales, marketing, PR, HR and nearly every\nother business activity.\n\n#### 1\\. Don\u2019t rebrand the product when you can rebrand the problem.\n\nRebranding the product puts you in a consideration set with other products,\nbut rebranding the problem can put you in a consideration set of one.\n\nEVRYMAN reframed the problem of therapy from \u201cfinding yourself\u201d to \u201ccreating\nyourself\u201d before they positioned their product. Cofertility rebranded the\nproblem of fertility from \u201cegg freezing and donation\u201d to \u201ctouching human\nlives\u201d in order to make their product newly relevant.\n\nWe recently helped a client in the debt relief industry rebrand the problem of\nowing money. Debt relief is a murky category with shady players, and while we\nunderstood the tremendous integrity that our particular client was built with,\nwe knew it made no sense to say, \u201cHey, trust us! We\u2019re the good guys!\u201d (a very\ncommon mistake many brands make).\n\nInstead, we dug deep in our psychographic research and saw something\nremarkable\u2014when people go into debt, they become the debt.\n\nTheir entire identities are reduced to one dimension: They no longer identify\nwith their hobbies, they stop going to family functions, stop volunteering,\nstop enjoying time with friends, stop taking pride in their work, stop\nplanning their lives.\n\nThey lose what makes them human, and understanding this was the real brand\nopportunity.\n\nThe brand wasn\u2019t about an honest debt relief company with good products,\nalthough that was very true, the brand was about re-dimensionalizing people.\nWe reframed the problem of \u201cdebt\u201d to the problem of \u201closing selfhood.\u201d And\nthat is the concept we built their entire strategy on.\n\nImmediately, their rebranded ads, messaging and positioning saw a huge uptick,\nwhile the culture of the company evolved toward a singular vision that guided\nevery decision toward a common goal.\n\nThink clearly about what you\u2019re branding, because sometimes there is something\nmuch bigger than just the product.\n\n#### 2\\. Real conversion happens emotionally, not logically.\n\nPeople who have damage in the emotional centers of their brains are normal in\nevery single area of their lives with one notable exception\u2014they can\u2019t make\ngood decisions, and sometimes they can\u2019t make decisions at all.\n\nIt turns out that decision making is driven by emotion, and logic is what we\nuse after the fact to justify our actions. Risk assessment, emotional\nprocessing, memory, self-perception and social cognition are all bound\ntogether in our brains, and they are all part of a very complex, very\nemotional decision-making process.\n\nThat means B2B is just as emotional as B2C. It means underneath every feature\na user tells you matters to them lies an emotion they themselves perhaps don\u2019t\nunderstand. It also means feature-led branding will always lose.\n\nYou need to find out the emotional triggers that will truly convey your value\nto the user. Emotions, not features (or USP or benefits or measures of being\n\u201cbetter\u201d than your competitor) should be the basis of your brand.\n\nWhen people convert from the heart and not the head, they are more willing to\npay for premium products, more willing to evangelize and more likely to remain\nloyal in the face of UX and product issues, delays and other challenges. Why\nwould you give up that much goodwill by ignoring emotion?\n\n#### 3\\. Changing belief means changing identity.\n\nMost brands have one giant challenge between them and success: changing\npeople\u2019s beliefs.\n\nBut the thing about belief is that it\u2019s much more than ideas floating in our\nheads. Atomic Habits author James Clear famously documented how those who are\nmost likely to stick to changed beliefs and behaviors are the people who first\nchange their identities. Entrepreneur Seth Godin put it another way when he\nsaid, \u201cPeople like us do things like this.\u201d\n\nBelief and identity are so intertwined that changing our beliefs can feel like\nlosing ourselves. It\u2019s scary. We live in a culture that sees it as a sign of\nweakness\u2014for example, consider the fact that instead of celebrating\npoliticians who evolve their worldviews, we approach them with distrust and\nskepticism.\n\nBut when we change our beliefs, we change our behaviors, and it\u2019s oftentimes\nthe most effective way to get people to understand the value of your brand.\n\nThe best way to change people\u2019s minds is to help them see themselves\ndifferently in the world. In order to change the beliefs that held people back\nfrom running, Tracksmith first had to create an identity around a new \u201crunning\nclass\u201d of people who do it for the personal ritual. It created room for a new\nkind of runner\u2014someone who wasn\u2019t winning races but still had permission to\nenthusiastically invest in their running practice.\n\nIf your brand needs people to change their beliefs, give them an identity\nworth adopting.\n\n#### 4\\. Loose places crave tight cultures.\n\nEvery category has a culture. Psychologist Michele Gelfand has found that\ncultures fall on a spectrum between tight and loose. Tight cultures like\nfinance and sports are governed by strict norms, whereas loose cultures like\nparenting, food or psychedelics may have an overabundance of information but\nfew steadfast rules everyone can agree on.\n\nLoose culture categories feel chaotic. What diet is the right one for me? Am I\nraising my kid right? What is the morality of doing illegal drugs for mental\nhealth? These categories don\u2019t have a paradox of choice. They have an absence\nof norms.\n\nI\u2019ve found exploring this theory offers a useful framework for brands. Every\nbrand must assess the tightness or looseness of their culture. If there is a\npervading sense of normlessness, then it is likely that your audience is\nlooking for a specific perspective.\n\nToday\u2019s most successful food brands bring a tight culture to loose places.\nLesser Evil snacks, Ezekiel breads and Garden of Life supplements are brands\nbuilt on tight culture.\n\nEzekiel, for example, conjures the authority of biblical language to define\nwhat constitutes real, natural food. Is religious metaphor a cute vehicle for\nbranding bread? Sure. Is it a genius device for bringing a strong set of norms\nthat help consumers assess their bread choices amidst shelves of other\noptions? Also very much yes.\n\nIf there is a loose culture, there is an opportunity to set the rules of\nengagement for your space.\n\n#### 5\\. Love is great. Hate is useful. Indifference kills.\n\nMost brands have the problem of user indifference. People may think you have a\nnice enough brand but that doesn\u2019t compel them to convert. Don\u2019t get mired in\na quest to gently move indifferent people down the funnel.\n\nYour goal should be to create so much tension that your brand really turns on\nyour lovers or really turns off your haters but leaves no room for\nindifference. Chasing indifferent users will run your company into the ground.\n\nIdeally you\u2019d want to lean into the love side of the equation, but you can\nsuccessfully lean into the other side, as well. Marmite\u2019s \u201clove it or hate it\u201d\nmessaging created a near-mythical story around it\u2019s divisive flavor, but the\ntruth of the matter is that people were generally indifferent until the\ncompany decided to rebrand around this polarizing idea.\n\nOatly created https://fckoatly.com/, an aggregated history of hate toward the\nbrand that you either get and really love or don\u2019t get and really hate. The\none thing you can\u2019t do is remain indifferent.\n\nMost founders see indifference as being on the path to love, but that\u2019s a\ndangerous falsehood. Love and hate are on two ends of the same path, while\nindifference is a dead-end highway in another town. You will waste precious\ntime and dollars that could have been spent learning about your true base and\nhow to broaden your audience from there.\n\nYou\u2019d rather have lovers and haters than a world of bystanders.\n\n#### 6\\. Make people leave their biases at the door.\n\nBe cognizant of the consumer biases in your category. People may think\nchildcare is menial work, or that math skills are genetic, or that polyamory\nis shameful (all bases I have worked with for client brands), but it doesn\u2019t\nmatter if they\u2019re true or not. What matters is if people carry those biases to\nyour door.\n\nYou can either let them enter with old biases that will make them blind to\nyour USP, or you can signal a whole new set of rules that will make people\nenter with an open mind, ready to behave differently. I believe this will be\none of the most important factors in defining the brands that win and the\nbrands that lose in the next decade.\n\nWhen Qualtrics rebranded their category from user data to experience\nmanagement, they forced a new perspective on how data should be employed.\nExperience management meant seeing things more holistically across customers,\nemployees and broader stakeholders and crafting an experience, not merely\ndiagnosing problems.\n\nIt precluded people from bringing old notions about data into this new\nenvironment, which was crucial to their 2019 acquisition for $8 billion,\nreferred to as an \u201ceye-watering\u201d sum at the time.\n\n#### 7\\. Don\u2019t hide the experience behind conversion.\n\nI often meet companies that have great products and services but their brands\ndo little to reveal the experience beneath. They may talk about features or\nbenefits, but they don\u2019t surface the feelings that underpin them.\n\nHowever, without first understanding the experience, users are afraid of\nunknowns around how to engage and measure the benefit.\n\nDon\u2019t make your user wait until conversion to understand what the experience\ntruly is, because most of the time, they won\u2019t get far enough to find out.\nInstead, give them a glimpse of how they will feel upfront. Allow them, in\nsome small way, to experience your offering without having to first convert.\n\nAirbnb did this when their brand said, \u201cBelong Anywhere\u201d. That phrase offered\na brief window into the experience of traveling by way of locals\u2019 homes that,\nuntil then, had been locked far behind the door of conversion.\n\nFind out what really happens on the other side of conversion, capture the way\nthat your users change by way of your experience, and move it up front.\n\n#### 8\\. Don\u2019t let value get misattributed.\n\nWhen my team was building the brand for one of the world\u2019s largest work\nplatforms, we saw something very interesting happening in the user journey.\n\nThe super users that got the most value out of the platform believed they had\n\u201chacked\u201d it somehow. They believed that they themselves had figured out how to\nleverage the power of the platform in their business, without recognizing that\nthe UX was actually designed to get them to that point.\n\nOnce we saw it with this client, we began to see it with many others. If your\nuser journey is really good at helping people extract value from your\noffering, it\u2019s highly probable that people think it\u2019s because they are smart,\nnot because you are good. And that means less loyalty and brand equity.\n\nThis is why storytelling around the user journey is so important. You need to\ntake credit for all of the incremental value that is created well after\nconversion by demonstrating the thoughtful choices and guiding beliefs that\nled you to build that specific journey. Think of it as the digital version of\ncraftsmanship. It\u2019s an important narrative that helps people understand the\nvalue that you created for them.\n\n#### 9\\. Brand first, business second.\n\nBrand is not the look of your website or the tone of your marketing voice. It\nis the organizing idea for every activity your company engages in, including\nproduct, UX, sales, communications, recruiting and even your org chart.\n\nPeople read brands between the lines. They understand your brand not by what\nyou say but by what you do, and what you do counts in every single touchpoint,\nin every single channel. That\u2019s the point of brand strategy\u2014to orient every\nsingle business activity toward the same outcome. You should see your brand\nstrategy as a filter for every decision.\n\nThe Lego brand is about meaningful play for every age, but that brand isn\u2019t\nborne of their website or marketing alone. You must take their positioning,\nproduct strategy, collabs, press, communities, business model and innovations\naltogether to understand their deeper brand. If you stopped at the website,\nyou\u2019d just think it was a toy company.\n\nPatagonia\u2019s brand is about drastic measures to save the earth, such as suing\nthe US government and rebuffing the very VCs that turned the brand into a west\ncoast status symbol. These were tactical decisions made through the lens of\nthe brand.\n\nStrong businesses have brand strategy at their core. You\u2019d be hard pressed to\nfind much daylight between business and brand for companies like Tesla, Apple\nor Meta.\n\nTo make brand inferior to business is a mistake.\n\n#### 10\\. Strive for brand singularity.\n\nBrand singularity is when the company brand, the CEO brand and the employer\nbrand are all synonymous. It creates a powerful flywheel effect in which no\nmatter who your brand reaches or how it reaches them, you can be certain it\u2019s\nthe same resounding message every time.\n\nNot many companies have accomplished this yet. It\u2019s hard to maintain one\nbrand, let alone three that echo each other.\n\nAmazon, despite seasonal blowback, has incredible synchronicity between its\nemployer brand, customer brand and Jeff Bezos\u2019 personal brand. They all stand\nfor efficiency.\n\nYou see it in all three places, from their customer manifesto and investments\nin delivery to the carefully-placed stories of Jeff\u2019s two-pizza rule, upcycled\nboardroom tables and the story of a guy who found a way to sell books without\nhaving to store them anywhere.\n\nIt attracts talent, consumer trust and investor money.\n\n#### 11\\. Treat community like the first layer of brand.\n\nOur world of relationships is shifting from weak ties to strong ties\u2014from wide\nnetworks mostly filled with strangers on platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram\nto narrow but deeper networks where we share intimate values and culture like\nDiscord and Patreon.\n\nIn our research, we\u2019ve found that people are coming to expect community to be\nthe first layer of brand, especially in premium spaces where people are paying\nmore in money, time or education in order to use the product or service.\n\nThe community around Fly By Jing is what sells their premium-priced sauces and\nspice mixes. The company\u2019s marketing, product and overall experience are\nsolid, but it is the community that signals what this brand is really about.\nChances are that if you asked someone about Fly By Jing, they would start by\ntelling you about the brand\u2019s enthusiastic community first.\n\nWhere we once looked to experts, community now drives the level of trust\nneeded to convert in costly spaces.\n\n#### 12\\. Solve 5 problems with 1 solution.\n\nOne of the best heuristics for a good brand strategy is if it solves multiple\nproblems with a single solution. I personally like a ratio of 1 to 5.\n\nArchitectural Digest\u2019s recent rebrand has turned the once stuffy media label\ninto a newly relatable lifestyle hub that represents far more than\narchitecture alone.\n\nAccording to WANT, the branding agency behind the rebrand, Playbook for living\nwas a new brand positioning idea that \u201ccaptured in a powerful and simple way,\nthe notion of AD as the definitive \u2018dream\u2019 book that could direct and guide\nthe essential aspects of how architecture and design unite to create living\nspaces.\u201d\n\nThis concept allowed AD to successfully make their brand relatable to a much\nlarger audience without alienating their core base of conservative readers,\nmoving from being a utility (an educational resource) to being a lifestyle (a\nresource for imagination and inspiration). It meant tapping into the emotional\nopportunities of rule #3\u2014\u201cchanging belief means changing identity\u201d\u2014to make\nthemselves relevant to the much larger conversations of life, style and\nidentity. It also positioned the brand as a part of pop culture, which has\nresulted in natural and impactful collabs with celebrities and influencers and\nhas helped form a strong community of like-minded people around the AD brand.\n\nThey solved 5 problems with 1 solution, and this ratio is what makes a brand\nstrategic.\n\nHaving this high ratio means you are creating more equity with significantly\nless resources while keeping all of the company\u2019s momentum focused on a single\ndirection. It means you are leveraging specific brand choices today that will\ncreate a future market which favors your brand over others. You can\u2019t deny\nthat the AD brand has created a new design culture that today sidelines\ncompetitors like Dwell and Wallpaper.\n\nPlanning (5 solutions for 5 problems) creates work. Strategy (1 solution for 5\nproblems) creates great advantage.\n\n#### 13\\. Optimism is the only secret weapon.\n\nIf strategy lives on a time horizon, brand strategists need to have a strong\ngrasp of where the world is headed. Although it\u2019s very easy to only see the\nnegative outcomes that can happen on that horizon, any futurist or historian\ncan tell you that it is the optimistic future that pushes us forward and\nusually wins out.\n\nTime and time again I have experienced how optimism is a brand strategist\u2019s\nonly secret weapon. When you can forecast the unexpected benefits of\ntechnologies, cultural movements, emerging beliefs and behaviors instead of\nonly seeing the negative outcomes of so much change, you can plant your\nbrand\u2019s flag in the right territory.\n\nPessimism is easy, but optimism is very hard, which is part of the reason\nConcept Bureau Senior Strategist Zach Lamb has dubbed it a status signifier of\nour modern era.\n\nIt\u2019s a skill that takes a tremendous amount of imagination and flexibility\nbecause it rarely comes naturally. You must cultivate it (and if you\u2019re\ninterested in doing that, I recommend Jane McGonigal\u2019s book Imaginable). It is\nthe optimists, not the pessimists, who make the future and who are able to\nstand out in the present.\n\n#### 14\\. Let the work change you.\n\nNever judge your user, even if you see something in them that you don\u2019t like\nor want to change. My ultimate test for knowing if my team and I or our\nclients are approaching the user with total empathy is to answer the question,\n\u201cHas the work changed you?\u201d\n\nHave you looked at the user with enough of an open mind to let it change you\nas a person? Have you listened with enough presence to connect with a stranger\nor have a small piece of your worldview shifted?\n\nYou can\u2019t experience that kind of change without first asking a certain kind\nof question. \u201cCan you tell me a little bit about your work?\u201d in a user\ninterview will never get you transformative answers. \u201cIf you could have had a\njob for another life, what would it be? Who would you have been?\u201d demands a\ndegree of openness.\n\nYou will understand their deeper value systems, the lies they tell themselves,\nthe struggles they conceal and the lenses through which they make decisions.\nAll of these insights are a goldmine for not only branding, but for UX, UI,\npricing, positioning and product.\n\nYour goal with user research shouldn\u2019t be to merely gather data but rather to\nmake people feel seen. Without deep empathy, you are guaranteed to miss an\nimportant insight.\n\nThe reason why strategists love what they do is because it allows them to\nconstantly evolve past their own limited beliefs. Working with a beauty brand\nmade me excited about getting older. Branding a construction tech company made\nme proud of the American work ethic. Spending time with the fans of a plus\nsize clothing brand made me grateful for parts of myself I once tried to\nerase.\n\nIn fact, \u201cLet the work change you\u201d is our company\u2019s first value. It\u2019s that\nimportant.\n\nAsk yourself the last time the work changed how you related to a population\nyou thought you had nothing in common with. If you\u2019re not changing, you\u2019re not\nreally doing the work.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to follow all of these rules to have a successful brand, but\nit\u2019s crucial that you embody the general spirit of this list, which is to\nalways be questioning and investigating the deeper reasons why people think,\nbehave and believe the way that they do.\n\nThe greatest brand strategies have one thing in common: they understood their\nusers. On a fundamental level, that\u2019s what building a company is about, too.\nUnderstanding people is what leads to big and impactful ideas.\n\nI believe the path to an incredible brand strategy already exists for every\nbrand. Your job is to keep searching until you find it, and my hope is that\nthis list acts as a wayfinder on your journey there.\n\n## Written By\n\nJasmine Bina\n\nTwitter Linkedin\n\n## Sign Up For Our Newsletter\n\nSign up for our newsletter below to get our insights 2-4 times a month.
