Return with us to the\ngolden days of yesteryear!\n\nThe image links refer to PDF files produced by the scanner. They are fairly\nlarge, ranging up to a couple of MB, and are named .pdf. You may need a plugin\nor other software in order to view them; Adobe Acrobat is readily available.\n\nThe Postscript files are the result of OCR, are relatively modest in size (up\nto about 135KB) and should be suitable for viewing with a PS viewer or sending\nto a printer. They have been hand-edited by me in an attempt to make them look\nthe same as they originally did. There are also PDF renditions distilled from\nthe Postscript after OCR; they are smaller than the PS versions but have the\nsame content.\n\nOCR technology does a creditable job on reading plain typewritten text and in\nfinding the page layout, and a moderately good one in inferring what's likely\nto be adjustable (as opposed to tabular) text. Underlining, particularly when\ncombined with quote marks on the next line, is hard. The page layout in the PS\nversion is like that of the original, except that adjustment of words across\nlines uses some combination of the OCR program's guess and hand repair of its\nmisapprehensions. Substantive differences owe either to errors in the OCR that\nI failed to correct, or those introduced by me.\n\nThe scanning and OCR was done by the Textbridge package to create .tif files\nand also Word .doc files that I edited in Word; the PS was produced from Word\n7.0. I'd like to make good HTML, but the tools I've tried so far are\ninadequate. The PDF was created later (from the .tif), but also with\nTextbridge.\n\nThe original manuals were typed on a Model 37 Teletype terminal that was\nevidently not in perfect tune. No contemporary digital representation (e.g.\ntape) survives, so far as I know. Nor do we have an original paper copy of it.\nIf you look at the title page reproduced here in the image format, you'll see\nthat the real ink-and-hammer version belonged to Joe Ossanna and is marked in\nhis hand. The paper on which this version was printed was given to Mel Ferentz\non his retirement from Usenix, and the rendition here is from a xerographic\ncopy of Ossanna's original, made just before the gift to Mel.\n\nI don't know the whereabouts of any true \"first edition\" of the manual, in the\nsense of one of the copies in Bell System covers that we made for local\ndistribution. Ken Thompson or someone else might conceivably have one secreted\nsomewhere; I do not. Likewise, although we do have paper copies of the second\nthrough fourth edition manuals, I don't know of any digital version.\n\nWhen I look over this manual, I'm amazed by a lot of things: first, by what\nhas survived so long (the semantics of important system calls, and the\nimportant early commands) and also by what wasn't there. Neither pipes nor\ngrep are in it, for example. Even B was not central (the manual apologizes\nthat the B compiler is callable only by a shell script); C was still to come.\n\nWe even anticipated the millenium bug: time was measured in sixtieths of a\nsecond since 1 Jan. 1971 as a 32 bit quantity. The BUGS section for time(II)\nremarks, \"The cronological-minded reader will note that 2**32 sixtieths of a\nsecond is only about 2.5 years.\" Later, this was patched more than once by\ndeclaring a new epoch, then again in 1973 by making the units full seconds\ndating from the 1970 New Year--this is the \"classical\" Unix epoch. Of course,\nit only pushed the issue off to 2038. Yet, the cal program even in 1971 knew\nabout the hanky-panky in 1752!.\n\nOn the other hand, Ken had already written a chess-playing program, and we had\ndone most of a Fortran compiler.\n\nIn 1971, when this manual was written, we had moved off the original PDP-7 to\nthe PDP-11/20; it had 24KB of core memory, and no memory management hardware\nat all. The operating system and most of the software was still in assembly\nlanguage, (rewritten or new, not \"ported\"). By this time we knew about the\nupcoming PDP-11/45, and had visited Digital in Maynard to talk about it; in\nparticular, we had the specs for the floating-point instructions it supported.\nSo the system described here included a simulator for the instructions\n(fptrap(III)).\n\nHere's what is available for downloading now.\n\nLucent Technologies retains copyright on this material.\n\n#### HTML:\n\n  * manintro.html, the Title page and Introduction\n\n#### The manual contents, in post-OCR PostScript or PDF:\n\n  * manintro.ps, manintro.pdf, Title page and Introduction\n  * man11.ps, man11.pdf, Commands, part 1\n  * man12.ps, man12.pdf, Commands, part 2\n  * man13.ps, man13.pdf, Commands, part 3\n  * man14.ps, man14.pdf, Commands, part 4\n  * man21.ps, man21.pdf, System calls, part 1\n  * man22.ps, man22.pdf, System calls, part 2\n  * man31.ps, man31.pdf, Library routines\n  * man41.ps, man41.pdf, Special files\n  * man51.ps, man51.pdf, File formats\n  * man61.ps, man61.pdf, User-maintained software\n  * man71.ps, man71.pdf, Miscellaneous\n\n#### The manual contents, in gzipped post-OCR PostScript:\n\n  * manintro.ps.gz, Title page and Introduction\n  * man11.ps.gz, Commands, part 1\n  * man12.ps.gz, Commands, part 2\n  * man13.ps.gz, Commands, part 3\n  * man14.ps.gz, Commands, part 4\n  * man21.ps.gz, System calls, part 1\n  * man22.ps.gz, System calls, part 2\n  * man31.ps.gz, Library routines\n  * man41.ps.gz, Special files\n  * man51.ps.gz, File formats\n  * man61.ps.gz, User-maintained software\n  * man71.ps.gz, Miscellaneous\n\n#### The manual in (big) image format.\n\nOn 11 Jan 1999, these files were converted from TIFF format to the more\ngenerally portable (and somewhat smaller) PDF.
