It seriously\ndisturbs the senior patient if the coverage of the plan exceeds their budget.\nSo for that reason, we did the homework for you to provide you with the\ncriteria for the eligibility and enrollment of patients for Medicare. But,\nbefore starting your research, we suggest you first understand fully the\nmeaning of Medicare. For your guidance, we have defined it as below:\n\n## About Medicare\n\nMedicare is a federal insurance program. The coverage of each plan differs\nfrom patient to patient. As each one of them has different health\nrequirements, therefore they opt for a plan that suits them the most. Medicare\noffers many choices in coverage to best meet the needs of everyone.\nIndividuals interested in enrolling in Medicare should take the time to\ncompare their healthcare needs with the plans that are available in their\narea. The government offers it to people who are at least 65 years old or\nabove and also to individuals who have qualified for social security\ndisability for 24 months. Once you become admitted into it, then you can\nchoose from plenty of coverage options that go well with your needs.\n\nMedicare cover health concerns, and some other out-of-the-pocket expenditures\nfor those who are eligible. One thing to keep in mind is that the coverage of\nthe Medicare plan may vary from individual to individual according to the plan\nthey choose and their Medicaid and health condition. Because of this reason,\nMedicare offers different plans, and it\u2019s up to your choice to choose the plan\nthat best meets your needs. Patients that are interested in acquiring enrolled\nin Medicare, should do their research and compare the pros and cons of\ndifferent plans before choosing the right one for their medical and health\nneeds that is available in their residential location.\n\n## Medicare Enrollment and Eligibility\n\nYou can apply for Medicare if you\u2019re 65 years old or above and also if you\nhave any disability, but there are some requirements that you need to fulfill\nto gain maximum Medicare benefits at 65 or above. Some of the main\nrequirements include the following points:\n\n  * 65 years or older (or younger individuals when qualifying disabilities apply).\n  * Citizen or permanent resident of the U.S.\n  * If you are already receiving benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board then you will receive a letter by mail notifying you of your Medicare eligibility, as well as informational materials about Medicare.\n\nImportant things to know about this notification:\n\n  * It will arrive roughly 3 months prior to your 65th birthday.\n  * The information material will explain the choices available to you and how to act on them.\n  * You may decide to accept this Medicare enrollment or postpone it. If you are still employed and covered by employer insurance, you may decide that postponing until retirement is the right decision for you.\n\nIf you are not receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board\nbenefits, then you won\u2019t receive notification about your Medicare eligibility.\nIn case, if you\u2019re not part of receiving Social Security or Railroad\nRetirement benefits, then you cannot receive a notification related to your\nMedicare Eligibility.\n\nSet Appointment\n\nThis appointment is meant to alleviate any concerns and there is no-cost or\nobligation to make a change.\n\nSet Appointment\n\n## Medicare Supplement Plan Eligibility\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that one patient cannot enroll for Medicare\nadvantage or Medicare supplement (also known as Medigap) at the same time.\nWith the help of the Medicare supplement plan, it will cover your out-of-the-\npocket expenses that are gaps in Medicare parts private insurance companies.\nMedicare beneficiaries will cover your deductibles, coinsurances, and\ncopayments from the original Medicare.\n\nSome of the requirements that you need to qualify for Medigap coverage are\nmentioned below:\n\n  * The patient must be 65 years old or above.\n  * The patient has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\n  * The patient has been entitled to Social security and Railroad retirement benefits for more than 24 months.\n\nThe patient needs a kidney transplant or dialysis.\n\n## Medicare Choices & Coverage\n\nFor choosing a Medicare coverage plan for yourself, you might feel overwhelmed\nbecause plenty of options are available. Each option covers different health\nneeds, and they vary according to location as well. Once you are eligible for\nMedicare, you can choose your enrollment choices per your medical and health\nneeds. Patients who are receiving Social security benefits become\nautomatically enrolled. If not so, then they can sign up online easily on\nSocial Security Administration (SSA).\n\nAn interesting fact to know is that you can apply for Medicare even if you\u2019re\nnot retiring yet mentioned by cms.gov. It will give you a safe spot for your\nfuture but one thing to keep in mind is that you can get yourself signed up\nonly at specific months of the year. If you\u2019re not entitled to Social Security\nbenefits, then you can also pay monthly premiums to acquire into that plan.\nThe cost-sharing chart below will provide details on premiums for parts A.\nTherefore, it is important for you as a patient to understand the rules and\nregulations for enrollment in Medicare to avoid mistakes.\n\nThe federal government provides Original Medicare to patients including parts\nA and B. There is a facility that if you or your spouse has worked and paid\nfor Medicare taxes for a minimum of 10 years, then you are eligible for the\ncoverage of Part A that is premium permitted. For Part B, you have a choice\nwhether to enroll right away or postpone it and it also comes with the cost of\nthe monthly premium.\n\nMoreover, there are 2 options available from private insurance companies for\nyour additional coverage. You can choose wisely from both of the routes that\nare discussed below:\n\nOption 1: Keep Original Medicare and Add Supplement Insurance\n\nOriginal Medicare allows you to combine Parts (A, B, D) and Plans (i.e., F, G,\nN) to achieve the level of coverage you desire. For example, you could add\nPart D drug coverage or a Medicare Supplement (i.e., F, G, N), or add both to\nParts A and B.\n\nOption 2: Enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan\n\nMedicare Advantage (Part C) offers some additional benefits that Medicare does\nnot provide, however, they are managed private network plans, and the\ninsurance carrier approves claims as opposed to Medicare.\n\n## Is My Spouse Covered Under Medicare?\n\nSome assume that Medicare automatically covers their spouse once they qualify\nthemselves. However, there is no family coverage provided under Medicare. The\nminimum age of eligibility for Medicare is 65. Your spouse will have to meet\nthis requirement regardless of your qualification. If a person retires and\nenrolls in Medicare, the spouse will need to find other health insurance until\nthey are eligible by age.\n\n###### The next most asked question is-\n\n### When to Enroll?\n\nHere are the options with brief details:\n\nOriginal Medicare Parts A and B\n\nWhen you become eligible for Medicare at age 65, you can enroll in Original\nMedicare Part A and Medicare Part B. You can also postpone enrollment in Part\nB due to its monthly premium if you have creditable coverage. If you receive\nSocial Security benefits or Railroad Retirement Board benefits, then you are\nautomatically enrolled. If not, then you must contact a Social Security office\nor visit Medicare.gov.\n\nMedicare Part C and Part D\n\nOnce you are eligible for Original Medicare, you are also eligible for\nMedicare Parts C and D. Part C is Medicare Advantage. Part D is prescription\ndrug coverage. Private insurance companies provide these plans and have their\nown enrollment processes apart from your Original Medicare enrollment.\n\nMedicare Supplements\n\nOnce you have turned 65 and have enrolled in Original Medicare, you can\npurchase a Medicare supplement at any time. Private insurance companies also\nprovide supplement plans with their own enrollment processes.\n\n### Enrollment Periods for Medicare:\n\nThere are specific periods during the year when a person can enroll in\nMedicare, whether registering for the first time or switching plans.\n\nInitial Enrollment Period\n\nThe Initial Enrollment period refers to a seven-month period when a person\nfirst becomes eligible to enroll. It includes the three months before the\nperson\u2019s 65th birthday, the month of their birthday, and the three months\nafter. The timing is different in the case of disability.\n\nMedicare Annual Election Period\n\nThe Annual Enrollment period refers to the yearly period of October 15 \u2013\nDecember 7. Any Medicare recipient can enroll at this time or change Medicare\nplans. Coverage begins on January 1 of the following year.\n\nSpecial Enrollment Period\n\nThe Special Election period is for those who chose not to enroll during their\ninitial enrollment period. If the person meets the requirements, they are\nallowed to enroll in Medicare without penalty.\n\nGeneral Enrollment Period\n\nFor those who did not enroll during their initial enrollment period or a\nspecial enrollment period, there is another chance to enroll between January 1\n\u2013 March 31. Late penalties apply in some cases.\n\nMedicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period\n\nThe Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment period refers to the six-month period\nin which a person can buy Medicare Supplement Insurance. The period begins in\nthe month of the person\u2019s 65th birthday (and once enrolled in Part B) and\nextends for five months. During this period, the person can buy any available\nplan regardless of their health status. If the person misses this period, they\ncan still purchase supplemental coverage, but higher premiums may apply or\npossibly coverage denial.\n\nA person can also switch plans if they qualify for a Guaranteed Issued policy.\nStates such as MA, CT, CA, OR, and WA allow Medicare recipients to change\nplans without answering health questions outside their initial Open Enrollment\nperiod. They don\u2019t allow you to switch in all situations, but they enable more\ncases to switch plans. For example, California\u2019s birthday rule permits\nchanging plans up to 60 days from the day of your birthday.\n\n## Retirement & Medicare Choices:\n\n### Retiring Before 65\n\nIndividuals are only eligible for Medicare once they have turned 65, or in the\nevent they have a qualifying disability. So, if you retire before 65 and no\nlonger receive employer insurance coverage, you will need to find another\ninsurance plan until you are eligible for Medicare.\n\n### Retiring at 65\n\nAt age 65, you are eligible to enroll in Medicare. In addition, you may choose\nto enroll in supplement plans or Medicare Advantage Plans. If your employer\noffers health insurance to retirees, it is important to review the company\u2019s\nplan. Your employer may not offer health insurance once Medicare is eligible.\n\n### Continuing to Work After 65\n\nIf you continue to work after turning 65, you can enroll in Medicare or\npostpone it. Many choose to enroll in at least Part A, as there is no monthly\npremium for those that paid into social security for ten years. Some choose to\nenroll in Parts A and B; however, Part B comes with a monthly premium and can\nbe taxed. The individual\u2019s income determines the Part B premium cost, so this\nis a factor to consider.\n\n### Retiring After 65\n\nIf you have decided to work past 65 and have creditable coverage through your\nemployer, you are eligible for a Special Enrollment Period once you choose to\nretire. The Special Enrollment Period will give you two months when your\nemployer insurance coverage ends to enroll in a Medicare Advantage or\nSupplement plan. Signing up for a plan before retiring will ensure no coverage\ngaps and help you avoid penalties.\n\nSet Appointment\n\nThis appointment is meant to alleviate any concerns and there is no-cost or\nobligation to make a change.\n\nSet Appointment\n\nThe most asked question related to retirement and Medicare choices is-\n\n## Which part should I choose?\n\nAs you have so many options available, you need to sort out your choices to\nprevent yourself from choosing the wrong option. We advise you first to\nclarify your health concerns, finalize a budget and then select the best sign-\nup option available for the plan. Many patients opt for plans A, B, and D,\nadding Medigap coverage. Some of them go with the Medicare advantage plan.\nTherefore, it is necessary to check the cost of the plan first, especially if\nyou\u2019re retired as you have a minimum option available to enroll in Part A and\nPart B. In case you decide to work after your retirement while having\neligibility for group health plan coverage, then you can Medicare options\ndifferently. The best way to clear up this confusion is by communicating with\nyour current employer\u2019s human resource department. They will help you choose\noptions that are not overlapping.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want to learn more about your Medicare eligibility, connect directly\nwith one of our trusted agents.
