Now, we worry that there might only be five\nbuyers of servers and storage.\u201d\n\nJust as the coronavirus pandemic kicked in during the first quarter of 2020,\naccording to data from IDC that we have been tracking like a hawk since it was\nfirst released in 2021 in its Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Infrastructure\nTracker, service providers \u2013 meaning hyperscalers, cloud builders, and other\nservice providers who build datacenter infrastructure and sell capacity on it\n\u2013 as a group surpassed 50 percent share of combined server and storage\nrevenues on Earth. They had accounted for more than half of unit shipments\nseveral years earlier, by our estimates.\n\nIf the prognosticators at IDC are correct, four years from now as 2028 is\ncoming to a close, the service providers as a group will comprise more than\ntwo thirds of server and storage revenues for that year. The latest forecast\nfor 2028, in fact, shows the service providers, who bought $94.5 billion in\nserver and storage equipment in 2023 \u2013 up 5.6 percent and giving the SPs a\n56.4 percent share \u2013 will see their spending rise to $188.5 billion by 2028,\ngiving this prestigious group 69.7 percent share of money spent on this gear.\nEnterprises, governments, and academic institutions accounted for $73.1\nbillion in server and storage acquisitions last year, up a much healthier 11.6\npercent year on year and giving them a 43.6 percent share of spending. But by\n2028, with a compound annual growth rate that is 6.4X as small at 2.3 percent,\nthis EG&A share will fall to 30.3 percent of spending and will only hit $82\nbillion by 2028.\n\nThat is more like dozens of server buyers in that majority slice, but it is a\nlot closer to five server buyers than we would like. And we wonder how the\nremaining server OEMs who serve the EG&A class of customers are going to grow\nand stay financially healthy. Or in some cases, get financially healthy in the\nfirst place.\n\nHere is what sales of servers and storage to the SPs versus the EG&As looks\nlike over the past four years, which is the only data we have available from\nIDC for these two distinctions:\n\nThe gap between the two classes of server and storage buyers does not look all\nthat big, does it? But it has been inching up, on average, over the past two\nand a half decades, and it looks to us like AI servers running large language\nmodels is going to tip the balance starting in 2024. IDC did not explain the\nmassive difference in growth rates in its public report, but we think this is\nthe differentiator. And it might just turn out that LLMs are the killer apps\nfor clouds, compel enterprises, governments, and academic institutions to do\nit on the cloud rather than fight for budget and accelerators for their own\ndatacenters.\n\nGrowth for SPs and EG&As is choppy. Neither is particularly linear on a\nquarterly basis. But there will be a bigger gap opening up if IDC is right.\n\nThis data is presented by IDC as a way of explaining sales of machinery for\ncloudy infrastructure, as distinct from bare metal machines that run\nrelational databases and suites of ERP, SCM, CRM, and other back office\napplications. (Those are abbreviations for enterprise resource planning,\nsupply chain management, and customer relationship management, and they are\nthe major things that most enterprises do, which includes boring stuff like\naccounts payable and receivable and payroll. We think payroll is very\nexciting, personally. . . .)\n\nHere is how that spending looked for the past several years for shared cloud,\ndedicated cloud, and non-cloud uses:\n\nShared cloud infrastructure is just what it sounds like: Machines sold so they\ncan be virtualized and sold with multiple companies concurrently renting time\non them. Dedicated cloud means machines are sold to be used as host machines\nin the more traditional outsourcing sense \u2013 one box, one customer \u2013 as well as\noutpost infrastructure sold under a cloud pricing model for companies to run\nin their datacenter or in a co-location facility of their choosing. Non-cloud\nis that boring back office stuff that keeps the global economy actually\nspinning.\n\nIn the past, IDC broke the apart the dedicated cloud market into dedicated on\nthe cloud and dedicated on premises, and we are pretty sure it still does this\nbut it is no longer doing this in the data it releases to the public.\n\nHere is a monster table that brings all we know of the IDC covering 2022 and\n2023, also includes the forecast for 2024 and the one way out into 2028:\n\nFor those of you who think visually, here is a chart of cloud versus non-cloud\nserver and storage buying since 2014, which is part of an older and larger\ndataset we have been watching, before it broke out the different types of\ncloud spending and before it started giving the SP and EG&A breakout. Take a\ngander:\n\nAnd here is the breakdown of the different kinds of cloud versus non-cloud\nspending:\n\nAnd, to complete the set, here is a stacked bar chart that shows the breakdown\nin spending across the three types of customer use cases \u2013 non-cloud, shared\ncloud, and dedicated cloud \u2013 between 2023 and 2028:\n\nNearly two decades ago, when the second wave of utility computing started \u2013\nremember the rise of application service providers and grid computing in the\nwake of the commercialization of Internet technologies in the late 1990s? \u2013 it\nwas important to monitor the rise of the cloud computing consumption model.\nBut in the end, cloud is just a consumption model. What we talked about at the\ntop of this story is a change in the consumers themselves, and this is perhaps\nmore profound in the long run.\n\nIn that longest of runs, enterprises may lose the skillsets required to run\ntheir own infrastructure as they become more dependent on service providers.\nIn that longest of runs, there may not be independent chip makers and system\nmakers and storage makers, and IT may get a hell of a lot more expensive\nbecause of that. There may not be any server buyers at all, and no server\nmakers. Just hyperscale clouds (that is an intentional hybrid) that sell\napplication access with expensive AI built in that no one can easily replicate\nin a datacenter of their own, all based on hardware of their own design and\nmaking.\n\nWhat if the plan for the hyperscalers and cloud builders is not just to build\ntheir own stuff, but to keep you and your OEM partners from building an\nalternative? That is what happens when the EG&A sector gets too small, and\ndon\u2019t think for a second these ever-hungry behemoths don\u2019t know it.\n\nResist. Control your fate. Pay for it. Your future is yours, not theirs. Own\nit.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.
