The system was a dusty legend with some cynical minds arguing\nwhether it existed in the first place.\n\nHowever, Lenat\u2019s death in August last year has unlocked his SAILDART archives\naccount. This has led to a thrilling discovery of both AM and EURISKO sources\nby WhiteFlame. In a further development, seveno4 has managed to adapt EURISKO\nto run on Medley Interlisp.\n\nWhile I marveled at the idea of discovery systems before I hadn\u2019t even\nconsidered ever running EURISKO myself as a possibility. Truly an Indiana\nJones finding the Lost Ark moment. Yet this very low probability event has\nindeed happened, as documented in the video below. Rewind to 8:20 for the\nMedley run.\n\n\u00a9 2015-2024 Eugene Zaikonnikov\n\n", "frontpage": false}
