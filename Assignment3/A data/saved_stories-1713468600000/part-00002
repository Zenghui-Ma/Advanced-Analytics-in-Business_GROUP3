Valkey will continue development\nbased on Redis OSS 7.2.4 and will keep the project available for use and\ndistribution under the open source Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)\n3-clause license.\n\nSince the Redis project was founded in 2009, thousands of open source\ndevelopers have contributed significantly to its growth and success. To\ncontinue improving on this important technology and allow for unfettered\ndistribution of the project, the community created Valkey, an open source high\nperformance key-value store. The community has now unveiled Valkey 7.2.5-rc1,\na release candidate for initial compatibility, which will allow existing Redis\nusers to easily migrate to Valkey with no backwards incompatible API changes.\nThe team is also working on an upcoming major release, Valkey 8.0, which will\ninclude new features such as more reliable slot migration and memory\nefficiency improvements. The Valkey 8.0 release is expected to become\navailable by the end of 2024.\n\nIndustry participants supporting the Valkey project have expanded to include\nAiven, Alibaba Cloud, Chainguard, Heroku, Huawei, Percona, and Verizon, in\naddition to existing partners Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Oracle,\nEricsson, and Snap Inc. The core group of maintainers and contributors is also\nexpanding, as Valkey encourages contribution in an open and collaborative\nmanner. Together, the Valkey community will focus on making contributions that\nsupport the long-term health and viability of the project so that everyone can\nbenefit from it.\n\nAt the Linux Foundation, Valkey will follow an open governance model,\nremaining community-driven and welcoming of all users and contributors. The\nproject has already assembled a technical leadership committee of several\nformer Redis contributors, and hundreds more community members have voiced\ntheir intent to support Valkey. To learn more about Valkey, please visit the\nproject on GitHub.\n\n#### Supporting Quotes\n\n\"Aiven is a strong supporter of open source with open governance. We were\ndelighted to hear about the creation of Valkey and we are supporters of this\nproject. We plan to get to work with this technology at the earliest\nopportunity, and to add it to the Aiven Platform so that our customers can\ncontinue to benefit from access to the most popular and widely adopted open\nsource data and AI technology\" \u2013 Oskari Saarenmaa, CEO & Co-founder, Aiven.\n\n\"For the past seven years, I've made many friends in the Redis community, we\nall share a deep passion for Redis. And as a core team member, I continuously\ncontributed code to the community, including many key features on our platform\n\u2014 that's what open source is all about. Now, we've started Valkey to keep that\nwork going. We're all about keeping the open source spirit alive, making the\ncommunity better, and giving users and developers a great experience.\" \u2013 Zhao\nZhao, Former Redis Core Team Member, Co-Maintainter of Valkey, Software\nEngineer, Alibaba Cloud.\n\n\"I am very happy to witness the establishment of the new Valkey community, and\nalso very happy to see many contributors from the Redis community gathering in\nValkey. Alibaba Cloud has been continuously contributing to the Redis project\nsince 2017 and is committed to promoting a better Redis community. Going\nforward, in an open, sustainable environment like the Linux Foundation, we\nlook forward to providing further support and contributions to the Valkey\nproject, and we look forward to Valkey becoming a vibrant project and\nthriving.\" \u2013 Dr. FeiFei Li, President of Database Products Business at Alibaba\nCloud, VP of Alibaba Cloud.\n\n\u201cRedis has been one of the most versatile and popular databases available, and\nI am happy to see the Linux Foundation establish a sustainable community for\nthe future of this foundational technology with Valkey that promotes open\nsource innovation and growth. Chainguard will be adding a Valkey package to\nWolfi and Valkey to our Chainguard Images Directory to bring minimal, secure-\nby-default, and up-to-date options to the community to leverage for their open\nsource projects and applications.\u201d \u2013 Dan Lorenc, CEO and Co-founder of\nChainguard.\n\n\u201cHeroku believes in Valkey's mission and purpose, and we're impressed by its\ncommunity support. With this group of experienced contributors and broad\nindustry backing, Valkey is continuing the open source model that\u2019s been\ntransformative for developers everywhere. We trust that the project will\ncontinue to innovate so that developers can keep building critical, data\ndriven applications using their favorite open source key-value data store.\" \u2013\nGail Frederick, Heroku CTO, Salesforce.\n\n\u201cSince 2019, the Huawei Platform and Service team has contributed\nsignificantly to Redis Open Source. I was quite upset when I heard Redis was\nclosed source a few weeks ago. Valkey is a great replacement for Redis that\ncan resume our roadmap for a truly free open source project. This will benefit\nall members of the community. My team will continuously contribute to Valkey\nopen source, and will work closely with other members of the community to\nbuild a truly open source product.\" \u2013 Paul Chen, Distinguished Engineer &\nChief Architect, Huawei Canada.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve used Redis for over a decade which includes building software\napplications that leverage Redis and have created several open source\nlibraries for it. I'm thrilled to share my knowledge with the community and\nenable other developers to enhance Valkey's functionality by simplifying the\nprocess of building modules.\u201d \u2013 Dmitry Polyakovsky, consulting member of the\ntechnical staff, Oracle.\n\n\u201cAt Percona, we believe in the power of open source for creating better\nsoftware that meets the needs of users, developers, and companies, and that\nopen source supports us all in achieving our goals. Many of our customers\nalready use the Redis database, so the launch of Valkey to preserve unfettered\naccess via a fully open source, community-powered project is a logical and\nvital outcome of Redis' recent business decision. We plan to provide\ncommercial support for Valkey deployments in the future. We understand the\nneed for profitability and revenue around open source projects to fairly\ncompensate maintainers and contributors for their efforts. Over the past 17\nyears we have been working in this model, proving its viability without bait-\nand-switch licensing changes.\u201d \u2013 Ann Schlemmer, CEO at Percona.\n\n\u201cOpen source technologies are fundamental to modern IT infrastructure and\nVerizon is a major user of these technologies. Serving our customers requires\ncontinued improvement and innovation so we are delighted to see the Linux\nFoundation launch the Valkey project, ensuring that unencumbered access and\ncollaboration continue on in memory key value database technology.\" \u2013 Dirk\nHohndel, Senior Director, Open Source Program Office at Verizon.\n\n###\n\nAbout The Linux Foundation\n\nThe Linux Foundation is the world\u2019s leading home for collaboration on open\nsource software, hardware, standards, and data.
