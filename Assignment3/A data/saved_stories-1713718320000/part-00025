Brave, a browser that prioritizes user privacy and security, has\nexploded in popularity since 2020.\n\nA just society would esteem and elevate Eich for proving to be so effective\nand generous in everything, from his ten-day sprint to produce the first\nspecification of JavaScript, to his stewardship of the Netscape codebase and\nhis leadership at Mozilla and now Brave.\n\nJavaScript is one of the three fundamental technologies on which 99 percent of\nuser-facing websites are coded. Free and open-source, meaning anyone can\nimplement the technology without licensing, JavaScript unlocked a universe of\npossibilities in function and aesthetics for websites and browser-based\napplications.\n\nEich\u2019s career is often defined by JavaScript, but it is his work on free\nbrowsers for the people that the true theme emerges. Eich is a student of the\nAmerican spirit, which, from the Founding to today, he takes to be\ncharacteristically pragmatic and productive. It is not \u201chard revolutionary,\nit\u2019s not trying to burn the past and destroy everything,\u201d Eich told Lex\nFridman in an interview. \u201cWe have these rights and we have duties, too.\u201d\nAmericans will only tolerate so much oligarchy and incompetence until a small\nband of overachievers will take it upon themselves to disrupt the system and\nrestore the balance so they can once again fulfill their duties.\n\nMuch of Eich\u2019s work revolves around the empowerment of the principled few who\ncan benefit the many. A small group of people built the simple but brilliant\ntools that we all use in our daily lives, and they did so utilizing\ntechnologies designed by an even smaller cohort\u2014composed of people like\nEich\u2014for the purpose of constant creation and iteration.\n\nThe World Wide Web held promise for freedom and prosperity, and Eich\ncontributed to the fulfillment of that potential. He is also intimately aware\nof the risk one takes when a life is lived, and society is run, in constant\nconnection to that web. When companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and\nFacebook know everything you view, say, buy, and sell, even where you live and\ngo, you cannot meaningfully exercise sovereignty. The exercise of true\npersonal sovereignty\u2014and thus collective political sovereignty as The\nPeople\u2014is impossible without possessing control over your own data.\n\nIt is poetic, then, that ten years ago Eich\u2019s cancellation was the first event\nto demonstrate the awesome danger we now face.\n\nI was working in New York's \u201cSilicon Alley\u201d when it happened, and I\nimmediately recognized it as a major escalation in the culture war. It was a\nwarning that the Leviathan of technocracy did not care how well I did, how\nhard I worked, or how well I treated others. Ideological conformity to the\ntop-down, programmatic transformation of the country that was rapidly taking\nplace was all that mattered. If I was unwilling to affirm the current thing\ndictated according to the whims of \u201cprogress,\u201d I was an enemy of humanity and\nan enemy of America. And my beliefs, no matter how ancient, innocent, and\nvalid, must bow to the will of Leviathan, or the digital swarm would descend\nupon me. In fact, the higher I rose, the harder opponents would hunt for an\nexcuse to throw me, like Belteshazzar, to the lions.\n\nThe attack on Eich has been replayed hundreds of times in the last decade in\nthe ritual scapegoating of successful men and women who run afoul of the\nregime. And, being totalitarians, the cancellers aren\u2019t satisfied with mere\nprofessional or reputation harm but seek a comprehensive and permanent\ndestruction of their victims that includes even ostracism by friends and\nfamily. This is what they sought in Eich\u2019s case. Mercifully, they failed.\n\nI am not here to complain about cancel culture. Brendan Eich does not. He is\ntoo busy. He refuses to be defined by the evil done to him, or by the\npurported heterodoxy of his beliefs, but by the work he does and by his\ncharacter, as known by those closest to him.\n\nRather than taking to the airwaves and leaning into the role of martyr, as\nhave so many others who have endured similar abuse, Eich never speaks publicly\nabout the wrong done to him\u2014not once even in private to me. Instead, he\ndiligently pursues his vocation.\n\nIn this, he is emulating Christ, who, when his disciples were worried that he\nhad not been provided anything to eat, replied that his sustenance was \u201cto do\nthe will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.\u201d Finding work to do that\nmakes you fearless will make you unstoppable. Setbacks will become stepping\nstones to a more refined vision of one\u2019s vocation. The wrongs done to you will\nbecome opportunities for cultivating wisdom necessary for your next iteration,\nmaking you stronger, more resilient, less fragile.\n\nIn 2014 I was worried that what happened to Brendan Eich might happen to me.\nHow much could I stand to lose? My reputation? A position? A business?\nFriends? Family? I remember fearing that anything I built could be snatched\naway, that the Eye of Sauron might fix upon me and unleash a legion of woke\norcs against me and those I loved.\n\nNow, a decade later, I have more reasons to be afraid. I have built things I\nlove with people I love: a family, a business, a circle of friends and\nassociates. All the while, the enemies of the Good have grown even more\ntotalitarian. And yet I do not fear, in good part due to Eich\u2019s example. The\ndarkness stole things from him, but it failed to stop him from doing the work\nhe believes transcends his own life.\n\nIn the same Fridman interview, Eich was asked whether, after all his world-\nchanging accomplishments, he fears death. Brendan said he did not, citing his\nCatholic faith, and observed that those who do fear death often feel like\nthey\u2019ve \u201cmissed out on opportunities to do something that will endure.\u201d\n\nThe dangers of ten years ago are greater now for faithful Christians. But if\nwe diligently perform the work that God has called us to, we can suffer delay,\nand even death, without fear. The work will endure, because it is His work.\n\nAndrew Beck is partner at Beck & Stone.\n\nFirst Things depends on its subscribers and supporters.
