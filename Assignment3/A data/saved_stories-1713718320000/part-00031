Weichert\n\nSummary: The Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23A \"Black Widow II\" and the\nLockheed Martin/Boeing/General Dynamics-designed F-22A \"Raptor\" were both\ncontenders in the 1980s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) Program aimed at\noutmatching Soviet capabilities. Despite the YF-23A's superior speed, range,\nand stealth, the Air Force selected the F-22 for its maneuverability and\ndogfighting abilities amidst Cold War tensions. However, the evolving threats\nof the 21st century, highlighting the need for longer ranges and greater\nspeeds, suggest that the YF-23A's design may have been more forward-thinking.\nToday, the YF-23A's influence is seen in next-generation aircraft designs,\nhinting at its enduring legacy in military aviation innovation.\n\n## The Legacy of the YF-23A: How It's Shaping the Future of U.S. Air Dominance\n\nThe Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23A \u201cBlack Widow II\u201d was a finalist for the\n1980 United States Air Force Advanced Tactical Fight (ATF) Program. Its\nprimary challenger was the Lockheed Martin/Boeing/General Dynamics-designed\nF-22A \u201cRaptor.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s ATF program was designed to push the limits of American\nmilitary aerospace capabilities and, in the process, develop a next-generation\nwarplane that would far outstrip anything the Soviet Union (America\u2019s primary\nthreat at the time) could develop and deploy against the Western alliance.\n\nBoth the YF-23A and F-22A were lightyears ahead of their time.\n\nUltimately, the Air Force chose to go with the F-22 as its next, fifth-\ngeneration air superiority fighter. Even today, the F-22 is considered the\nmost advanced manned warplane in the world. What\u2019s more, in every wargame\nwhere the F-22 is deployed, the presence of even two F-22 Raptors tips the\nbalance of the engagement in favor of the US side.\n\n## Why Not the YF-23A?\n\nThe YF-23A was unlike anything that the Air Force had seen. It had a delta-\nwing shape. Its speed and range were second-to-none. The Black Widow II\npossessed an incredible stealth capability as well. But the engineers at\nNorthrop/McDonnell Douglas were not necessarily following the parameters that\nthe Air Force had put down for the ATF Program. Since the YF-23A was supposed\nto be an \u201cAir Superiority Fighter,\u201d it was intended to be a dogfighter.\n\nGo back to the 1980s. Lift your blinders about how Star-Spangled Awesome\nRonald Reagan was (he was, in fact, that amazing). Remember that, especially\nin the first few years of the 1980s, the Soviet Union was led by the hardliner\nand former KGB leader, Yuri Andropov. According to most reports, Andropov\nloathed Reagan. He believed that Ronald Reagan was a Christian fundamentalist\nwho was going to launch a preemptive nuclear strike on the United States in\norder to initiate Armageddon.\n\nTensions between the Soviets and Americans during this time were at highs\nunseen since the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact, there was almost a nuclear war\nbetween the two sides during NATO\u2019s Able-Archer exercises in Europe in 1983.\n\nBack then, most US war planners believed that a shooting war between the\nSoviets and Americans was at hand. The CIA and other intelligence agencies\nrefused to buy into Reagan\u2019s (correct) assumption that the USSR was on its\nlast legs and would go the way of the dinosaur by the time Reagan\u2019s presidency\nended. CIA officials had long maintained throughout the 1980s that the USSR\nwould be with us at least until 2015.\n\nSo, the Air Force had to prepare to fight against the Soviets. One such area\nthe US needed to be prepared for kinetic conflict was in the air. Therefore,\nthe Americans needed a warplane that would be both stealthy as well as highly\nmaneuverable. The F-22 fit that bill far better than the YF-23A Black Widow II\ndid.\n\n## The YF-23A, Reconsidered\n\nIt\u2019s too bad that the Air Force did not take more time to consider the YF-23A.\nBecause, while the F-22 is the best warplane in service today, the kind of\nthreats that the United States faces in the 21st century would best be\ncountered by warplanes with longer ranges and greater speeds, such as the\nYF-23A, not the F-22A, possessed.\n\nFurther, given the Air Force\u2019s insistence on building the Next Generation Air\nDominance (NGAD) sixth-generation warplane, it would appear as though that\nproposed system takes some design inspiration from the abandoned YF-23A.\nNotably, the design for the new NGAD fighter is a diamond-shaped wing, just as\nthe YF-23A was.\n\nThe YF-23A Black Widow II was powered by two Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines\nwhich had a maximum thrust of about 35,000 lbs. The YF-23A was a unique bird\nin that it could cruise supersonic (\u201csupercruise\u201d) without the need for\nafterburners or the use of engine augmentation. It had a top speed of about\nMach 2 (1,451 mph).\n\n## The YF-23A was Better Than the F-22A Raptor\n\nAs sophisticated and amazing as the F-22A Raptor is, politics and the economy\nconspired to kill this goose before it could lay its golden egg. Back in 2009,\nthe Obama Administration cut the production line for the F-22A prematurely to\ntry to save some money during the fallout from the 2008 Great Recession.\nBecause of that, the F-22A never reached its maximum potential.\n\nPlus, the Obama Administration argued that the F-22A\u2019s mission was antiquated.\nInstead of an air superiority fighter that could dogfight, Obama wanted to\nfocus on the F-35 Lightning II fifth-generation warplane, since it could do\nmore than dogfight. Obama believed the F-22A was no longer relevant to the\nstrategic reality in 2009.\n\nYet, the YF-23A Black Widow II, which was a superior bird to the F-35 and\ncould do much of what the F-22A could do\u2014while being able to travel faster and\ndeeper into enemy territory\u2014would have been better for countering the anti-\naccess/area denial (A2/AD) threats of today. The YF-23A\u2019s stealth would have\nhelped to insulate it from the A2/AD systems plaguing US war planners today.\n\nThe YF-23A\u2019s speed would have allowed for it to believably drop its payload\nover enemy targets and then outrun any incoming missiles from the surface.\n\nLastly, the YF-23A\u2019s superior fuel range would have meant that it could deploy\nfrom jus over-the-horizon, without being jeopardized if an airstrip, like\nthose on Guam, near to China, were destroyed by Chinese A2/AD missiles. These\nbirds could have come from farther away, drop their bombs, and skip away\nbefore any A2/AD systems could catch them.\n\nAlas, the Air Force was sticking to the needs of the force in the 1980s. If\nthey had been more forward-thinking, though, they might have been able to\nbuild a warplane that was best suited for the warfare of the 21st century.\n\nAs they say, however, it is always better to be late than never. Let\u2019s hope\nthat isn\u2019t the US Air Force\u2019s epitaph.\n\n## About the Author\n\nBrandon J.
