The UK is top with 765 listings.\n\nWhile Sweden\u2019s total IPO fundraising volumes are well below those in the US \u2014\nwhere some larger Swedish companies such as music service Spotify and drinks\nmaker Oatly have listed \u2014 the Nordic country has been highly successful at\nencouraging smaller domestic businesses to stay at home, encouraged by the\ndepth of its stock market.\n\n\u201cCompared to the size of the country and also the size of the stock exchange,\nthe [Swedish] IPO market has definitely been more vibrant in allowing smaller\ncompanies to list than others,\u201d said Tony Elofsson, chief executive of\nCarnegie Group, a Nordic bank and asset manager. Around 90 per cent of\nlistings are valued at less than $1bn, according to Adam Kosty\u00e1l, president of\nNasdaq Stockholm.\n\nA key driver has been the country\u2019s investment culture, which Carnegie\u2019s\nElofsson says has attracted \u201ceveryone from the man on the street to very\nengaged private banking investors, entrepreneurs, but also the small and mid-\ncap investment community\u201d, referring to institutional investors.\n\nAmong larger investors, Swedish pension funds have long owned domestic\nequities. The country\u2019s four biggest retirement schemes have roughly\nmaintained or increased their holdings of domestic equities in recent years.\nIn the UK, in contrast, domestic equity holdings among pension funds have\nplunged to about 4 per cent. Meanwhile, Swedish insurance companies have the\nhighest holdings of stocks in the EU.\n\nLarge investors typically take the role of so-called cornerstone investors in\nIPOs, according to John Thiman, partner at law firm White and Case in\nStockholm, giving confidence to businesses preparing to go public, and to\nother investors.\n\n\u201cEvery single successful IPO has involved some level of cornerstone\ninvestors,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a very strong equity sentiment from rock solid\ninvestors.\u201d\n\nRetail investors are also big buyers of Swedish stocks, helped by a wealth of\nreforms in recent decades. Compared with the rest of Europe, Swedish\nhouseholds hold among the highest proportion of their investments in listed\ncompanies and among the lowest in bank deposit holdings, while financial\nliteracy is greater than in Germany, France or Spain.\n\nIn 1984, the government introduced Allemansspar, a product enabling ordinary\nSwedes to invest in stock markets. By 1990 there were already 1.7mn of these\naccounts, helping drive the launch of domestically focused small and mid-cap\nfunds.\n\nSuch funds arrived \u201c10-to-20 years before any other country did anything\nsimilar, at least in Europe\u201d, said Carl Rosenius, head of equity capital\nmarkets at Swedish bank SEB. \u201cThat\u2019s been the success story in Sweden for\nsure, having large funds actively looking at domestic small and mid-cap\nopportunities.\u201d\n\nRule changes in the 1990s allowed people to invest 2.5 per cent of the amount\nthey allocate to their pensions into funds of their choice, supported by a\npublic information campaign.\n\nAnd in 2012 the state introduced investment savings accounts called ISKs that\nallow individuals to invest without needing to report their holdings or worry\nabout capital gains or dividend tax. Instead, the total value of the account\nis taxed \u2014 and in 2024 that was at a level of about 1 per cent.\n\nSome charities go into schools to educate those aged 16 to 18 about finance,\nfor instance on the difference between shares and mutual funds, according to\nJoacim Olsson, chief executive of Swedish shareholder group Aktiespararna.\n\nOther European countries are racing to encourage their populations to invest\nin stocks. The UK last month launched a \u00a35,000 tax-free allowance for\ninvesting in British companies, while France\u2019s finance minister, frustrated\nwith the pace of EU reforms, has called for a few countries to forge ahead\nalone and create a new investment product.\n\nNasdaq Stockholm has even been trying to lure foreign businesses, for instance\nsmall and medium-sized companies in Germany, which Kosty\u00e1l said is\n\u201cunderserved in terms of the local IPO market\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Germany has an infrastructure problem insofar that it\u2019s very\ndifficult for smaller companies to list there,\u201d said Joakim Falkner, partner\nat Baker McKenzie in Stockholm. German investors have historically favoured\nbonds over stocks, making equity raising more challenging.\n\nMyles Murray, founder of Irish medical equipment maker PMD Solutions, chose to\nIPO in Stockholm earlier this year, saying the plethora of comparable\nhealthcare companies listed there meant analysts could more easily assess his\ncompany, compared with listing on Euronext Dublin.\n\nAccess to large investors was a big help. \u201cWe were a foreign company, pre\nprofit, and the smallest of brokers could get a meeting with [the big pension\nfunds] and that was very surprising,\u201d said Murray.\n\nSweden\u2019s system appears to have translated into stock market returns. Its main\nindex has gained 85 per cent over the past decade, while the Euro Stoxx 600\nindex has risen 49 per cent and London\u2019s FTSE 100 just 17 per cent.\n\nThat, too, is helping persuade Swedish small and mid-sized companies to stay\nat home.\n\n\u201cWhy cross the river to get water, as we say in Sweden,\u201d said Carnegie\u2019s\nElofsson.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
