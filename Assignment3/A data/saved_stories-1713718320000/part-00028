Government ministers say they expect social media companies to comply with Australian law and protect the community, and are prepared for a fight in court.\n\nSocial media giant X (formerly known as Twitter) has claimed it could face\ndaily fines of $785,000 if it does not take down content that references the\nstabbing of Sydney bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel.\n\nFollowing the attack on Monday night, politicians from across the country\nrepeatedly called on social media companies to take down any content that\nrisked further inflaming rising tensions.\n\nThe office of the eSafety commissioner said it had \"engaged\" with major social\nmedia platforms in relation to the resharing and reposting of class one\ncontent that depicted \"recent violence\" in Sydney.\n\n### Assyrian Orthodox Church bishop stabbed on Monday publicly forgives\nattacker\n\nBishop Mar Mari Emmanuel says he has forgiven \"whoever has done this act\" and\ncalls for his community to not retaliate.\n\nRead more\n\nClass one content is defined as promoting, inciting or instructing in matters\nof crime or violence and is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, eSafety said it expected platforms to make\n\"genuine efforts\" to protect Australians from harmful content.\n\n\"eSafety is aware social media users continue to upload and reshare\ndistressing content and appreciates it is challenging for platforms to manage\nthis,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We are also aware some platforms are responding by applying technological\nsolutions to prevent or reduce proliferation ... eSafety welcomes these\nactions.\"\n\neSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant is considering further regulatory\naction to control harmful content on social media platforms.(ABC News: Adam\nKennedy)\n\nIn a statement, X said it had received a \"demand\" from the eSafety\ncommissioner to take the posts down or face a daily fine of $785,000.\n\n\"The Australian eSafety commissioner ordered X to remove certain posts in\nAustralia that publicly commented on the recent attack against a Christian\nBishop. These posts did not violate X's rules on violent speech,\" the\nstatement said.\n\nThe content that the eSafety commissioner wants removed is classified as class\none content that relates to extreme violent images and videos.\n\nHowever, X indicated it would not comply with the request and would take the\nmatter to court.\n\n\"X believes that eSafety's order was not within the scope of Australian law\nand we complied with the directive pending a legal challenge.\n\n\"While X respects the right of a country to enforce its laws within its\njurisdiction, the eSafety commissioner does not have the authority to dictate\nwhat content X's users can see globally. We will robustly challenge this\nunlawful and dangerous approach in court.\n\n\"Global takedown orders go against the very principles of a free and open\ninternet and threaten free speech everywhere.\"\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns says it is \"about time\" tougher penalties are brought\nagainst social media companies.\n\n## Political leaders up for a fight\n\nFederal government minister Mark Butler said Australia would not back down\nfrom the demands issued by the eSafety Commissioner.\n\n\"Australia is not going to be bullied by Elon Musk or any other tech\nbillionaire in our commitment to making sure social media is a safe space,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"If he [Elon Musk] wants to fight that fine in court, we are up for that\nfight.\"\n\n### Regulator lashes Musk's X over failure to police hate\n\nThe eSafety commissioner says the social media platform's hate-monitoring\npractices are \"jaw-dropping\" after it reinstated thousands of banned\nAustralian accounts.\n\nRead more\n\nNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns said he was shocked but not surprised by\nX's response.\n\n\"This is exactly as I would expect from X ... a disregard for information they\npump into our communities.\n\n\"Lies and rumours spreading like wildfire and then when things go wrong,\nthrowing their hands up in the air to say they are not prepared to do anything\nabout it.\n\n\"We have had enough ... to think about young police officers who have to go\ninto harm's way to calm down a riot based on a rumour or innuendo means their\njob is next to impossible for them.\"\n\nThe owner of X, Elon Musk, used his platform to call the eSafety commissioner\n\"the Australian censorship commissar.\"\n\nThe Office of the eSafety Commissioner said on Friday it was considering\nwhether further regulatory action was warranted, but it has not publicly\ndiscussed the possibility of fines.\n\nCommunications Minister Michelle Rowland said the government's expectation was\nthat social media companies should remove the content immediately.\n\n### Meta, Google asked to explain how they combat violent material online\n\nAustralia's eSafety commissioner sent six companies legal notices that\nrequires them to answer detailed questions on how they are tackling the issue.\n\nRead more\n\n\"If you operate in Australia, you should comply with the law. It's as simple\nas that,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"Our clear message to Australians is please do not share or engage with this\ncontent. It is distressing and may very well cause harm to vulnerable\nAustralians \u2014 including children.\"\n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said social media companies had a\nresponsibility to protect the community.\n\n\"It shouldn't need the eSafety commissioner to intervene, to direct companies,\nin this case X and Meta, to take down violent videos,\" he said.\n\n\"We are prepared to take whatever action is necessary to haul these companies\ninto line. We've made that very clear because of the damage that a failure to\nact can have.\"\n\nPosted Yesterday at 3:04amSat 20 Apr 2024 at 3:04am, updated Yesterday at\n4:39amSat 20 Apr 2024 at 4:39am\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Court told teenager 'had long history' of mental health issues before allegedly stabbing bishop\n\n  * ### Bipartisan federal support for tougher knife laws after Sydney attacks\n\n  * ### 'There is not a knife crisis in NSW, there's a mental health crisis': Experts call for calm as leaders consider knife laws\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Australia\n  * Social Media\n  * Stabbings\n  * United States\n  * Wakeley\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Four days, five unrelated stabbing attacks: Sydney's horror week puts spotlight on knife crime\n\n  * ### Baby stabbed in Bondi Junction attack discharged from hospital\n\n  * ### Missing camper Steven Clough found dead in Victoria's high country\n\n  * ### Musk's response to Sydney stabbing footage prompts fury, as opposition supports crackdown on social media giants\n\n  * ### 'Some people fainted': Emotional parishioners return to Sydney church after stabbing\n\n  * live\n\n### 'He wants to fight me after the game': Fiery Knights prop follows through\non on-field threat, shoving Bulldog en route to sin-bin\n\n  * live\n\n### Greene banned by MRO as Hawks pile pain on hapless Roos\n\n  * ### Chinese swimming doping case sparks spat between global and US anti-doping agencies\n\n  * ### These two women are running for federal parliament as a single candidate\n\n  * ### A group of people allegedly traded human remains stolen from facilities across the US.
