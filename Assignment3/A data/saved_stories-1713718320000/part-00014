Using life on Earth as our guide, we look beyond green landscapes to\nexpand our ability to detect signs of surface life on other worlds. While\noxygenic photosynthesis gives rise to modern green landscapes,\nbacteriochlorophyll-based anoxygenic phototrophs can also colour their\nhabitats and could dominate a much wider range of environments on Earth-like\nexoplanets. Here, we characterize the reflectance spectra of a collection of\npurple sulfur and purple non-sulfur bacteria from a variety of anoxic and oxic\nenvironments. We present models for Earth-like planets where purple bacteria\ndominate the surface and show the impact of their signatures on the\nreflectance spectra of terrestrial exoplanets. Our research provides a new\nresource to guide the detection of purple bacteria and improves our chances of\ndetecting life on exoplanets with upcoming telescopes. Our biological pigment\ndata base for purple bacteria and the high-resolution spectra of Earth-like\nplanets, including ocean worlds, snowball planets, frozen worlds, and Earth\nanalogues, are available online, providing a tool for modellers and observers\nto train retrieval algorithms, optimize search strategies, and inform models\nof Earth-like planets, where purple is the new green.\n\nastrobiology, techniques: spectroscopic, planets and satellites: oceans,\nplanets and satellites: surface, planets and satellites: terrestrial planets\n\nIssue Section:\n\nArticle\n\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nWith more than 5 500 confirmed exoplanets and more than 30 potential Earth-\nlike planets (exoplanets.nasa.gov, 2024 February) our search for life in the\ncosmos is entering a new stage that requires including a wider diversity of\nlife on Earth (Hegde et al. 2015; O'Malley-James and Kaltenegger 2018; Coelho\net al. 2022) and its evolution (O'Malley-James and Kaltenegger 2018, 2019) to\ngenerate our key to finding it elsewhere.\n\nBefore the emergence of chlorophyll-based oxygenic photosynthesis (Lyons,\nReinhard and Planavsky 2014; Hamilton, Bryant and Macalady 2016), anoxygenic\nphotosynthesis prevailed, relying on bacteriochlorophylls (Hohmann-Marriott\nand Blankenship 2011). Oxygenic photosynthesis on modern Earth is often linked\nto lush green landscapes. Anoxygenic phototrophs, which can inhabit both\naquatic and land environments, can also colour their environments. Early Earth\nmay have been dominated by purple-pigmented bacteria, including purple non-\nsulfur bacteria (PNSB) and purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) (Brocks et al. 2005;\nSanrom\u00e1 et al. 2014).\n\nPSB are phototrophic anoxygenic bacteria that prefer reduced sulfur compounds\nas electron donors instead of water, thus not producing oxygen as a byproduct\nof photosynthesis. PNSB are photoheterotrophic bacteria meaning they use their\nphotosystems to mainly produce energy and electric potential while still\nrequiring an external organic carbon source. PNSB are versatile organisms that\ncan use some inorganic compounds (e.g. H_2) as electron donors, and that are\nless sensitive to oxygen and darkness than PSB, although more sensitive to\nsulfide (Madigan and Jung 2009).\n\nPNSB and PSB use biopigments called carotenoids as antennas to harvest light\nenergy in the visible range (Magdaong et al. 2014; Ma and Cui 2022). These\nbacteria also use bacteriochlorophylls (BChl) a and b, which serve as both\nantenna and reaction centre pigments and can harness visible to infrared (IR)\nradiation, absorbing and reflecting from 750 to 1100 nm (Kimura et al. 2023).\nThis spectral versatility arguably provides a competitive edge, allowing\norganisms with BChls to thrive in diverse and often challenging ecological\nniches across our planet, even deep-sea hydrothermal vents (Beatty et al.\n2005). In deep-sea conditions, they rely on IR energy to drive anoxygenic\nphototrophy, where radiation longer than 850 nm can serve as their standard\nenergy source. These characteristics could allow PNSB and PSB to thrive on\nexoplanets orbiting M-type stars because the spectral energy distribution of\nM-stars overlaps with the optimal spectral range for absorption and\nreflectance by BChl-a and -b (Wolstencroft and Raven 2002; Tinetti, Rashby and\nYung 2006; Kiang et al. 2007; Schwieterman et al. 2018; Lehmer et al. 2021;\nDuffy et al. 2023).\n\nEven Earth-analogue planets orbiting Sun-analogue stars can promote purple\nbacteria. Sanrom\u00e1 et al. (2014) measured the reflectivity of a single non-\nsulfur bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and modelled the spectrum of a\npurple Archean Earth from it. On modern Earth, purple cyanobacteria, PNSB, and\nPSB, colour surface landscapes in shallow waters, coasts, and marshes\n(Guglielmi, Cohen-Bazire and Bryant 1981; Wilbanks et al. 2014). Their colour\nintensifies when light becomes scarce, and pigment production increases\n(Magdaong et al. 2014), making purple bacteria particularly intriguing\ncandidates for exoplanetary habitability biopigment assessments. However, to\ndate, there is no reference data base for the reflectance spectra of the\ndiverse biopigments of purple biota.\n\nHere we grow and measure the reflectance spectra of a wide range of PNSB, PSB,\nand a purple cyanobacterium (hereafter we refer to our collection as \u2018purple\nbacteria\u2019). We show bacteria closely related to R. sphaeroides for reference\nin Figs 1 and 2 and expand on the measurement by Sanrom\u00e1 et al. (2014) by\nmeasuring the reflectance for a wide range of purple bacteria, including\nBlastochloris viridis, which broadens the range of photosynthesis to the near-\nIR. Until now, most models for terrestrial exoplanets that incorporate surface\nbiota exhibit a bias towards green pigments (Seager et al. 2005; O'Malley-\nJames and Kaltenegger 2018, 2019; Schwieterman et al. 2018). This bias is\nprimarily due to the limited reflectance spectra data for purple bacteria,\nwhich have not been extensively measured.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nFilters showing the measured purple non-sulfur bacteria (E01, E02, E11, E18,\nE23, E26, E33, E45, BV, and RV), purple sulfur bacteria (E03, E05, E06, E07,\nE10, E13, E28, E35, E41, E50, E51, E53), and purple cyanobacteria (Glo).

Dry samples (right) show a stronger reflectance than fresh samples\n(left), water absorption features at 1490 and 1900 nm are stronger in the\nfresh samples. The reflectance of the culture medium alone is shown as a\ndotted line for control.\n\nIn this study, we present a catalogue of reflectance spectra of biopigments\nfor a range of purple bacteria in fresh and dry states (following Coelho et\nal. 2022), measured with an integrating sphere to mimic exoplanet observing\nconditions (see Hegde et al. 2015). We used those measurements to model the\nspectra of a range of Earth-like planets dominated by diverse purple bacteria\nfor Earth-analogue planets, ocean worlds, snowball planets, as well as frozen\nworlds, with and without clouds. Our goal was to explore how their biopigments\ncan shape the reflectance spectra of habitable worlds.\n\nWe created a data base for the reflectance spectra of biopigments of a wide\nrange of purple bacteria from 400 to 2500 nm. This data base is available\nonline (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10697546) as a resource for observers\nand modellers to inform design decisions and optimize observations. We use\nthose measurements to simulate high-resolution reflectance spectra of Earth-\nlike exoplanets dominated by purple bacteria providing a data set to train\nretrieval algorithms and inform the observing strategies for telescopes like\nthe European Extremely Large Telescope (Gilmozzi and Spyromilio 2007) and the\ndesign of upcoming telescopes like the Habitable World Observatory (HWO)\n(Vaughan et al. 2023). These data bases provide a critical resource for\nobservers and modellers searching for life in the cosmos.\n\n## 2 METHODS\n\nWe grew a diverse set of purple bacteria in the laboratory, measured the\nreflectivity of their biopigments, and then used that data to simulate the\nreflectance spectra of Earth-like exoplanets dominated by purple biota.\n\nWe present enrichment samples (E01 to E53) and pure cultures (RV, BV, and Glo)\n\u2013 please see Fig. 1. The difference between an enrichment and a pure culture\nis that a pure culture is a single species while an enrichment can contain\nmany species but is typically dominated by a species of interest. Life as we\nknow it exists in complex communities and not in pure cultures and those\ncommunities will not always be dominated by one species. Thus, our sampling\nrelates to an exoplanet surface dominated by an ecosystem enriched in purple\nbacteria (a similar phenomenon to algae blooms and watermelon snow, where a\nsingle group of microbes dominates a whole landscape on modern Earth).\n\n### 2.1. Biological measurements\n\nAll cultures and enrichments were sampled from aquatic biomes, and the\nspecifics of their location of origin can be found in the supplementary\nmaterials. Briefly, RV and BV were obtained from S. Zinder's laboratory at\nCornell University (NY, US). PSB E53 was sampled by L.F. Coelho and S. Zinder\nfrom Beebe Lake (NY, US) and enriched using a modular medium for PSB with 3 mM\nof sulfide. PSB E51 and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 were obtained from T.\nHamilton's laboratory at the University of Minnesota (MN, US). PSB E51 was\nenriched from a sulfidic spring in NY. PSB and PNSB enrichments (E01-E50) were\ncourtesy of the Microbial Diversity 2023 Course (Marine Biological Laboratory,\nWoods Hole, MA, US).\n\nWe grew PSB and PNSB in a modular mineral basal medium based on Pfennig's SL9\nmedium (Tschech and Pfennig 1984). The PNSB grew under an N_2/CO_2 atmosphere\nwith 1 g L^\u22121 sodium succinate as the carbon source, and the PSB grew under\nautotrophic conditions in a 20 per cent CO_2 atmosphere and 1 per cent\nbicarbonate. The purple cyanobacterium G. violaceus PCC 7421 and blue-green\ncyanobacterium Anabaena sp. UTEX 2576 were grown in BG-11 medium. All cultures\nwere maintained at room temperature. Differences in the media and light\nrequirements for each culture or enrichment can be found in the supplementary\nmaterial \u2013 Table S1. Depending on the culture, the time required for growth\nvaried from about 24 h to 1 week. A volume of 20 mL of the\ncultures/enrichments was transferred to 50 mL Falcon centrifuge tubes until\nfiltration.\n\n### 2.2. Sample data collection\n\nWe deposited cultures on to a 0.45 \u03bcm 25 mm white mixed cellulose ester filter\nusing a 10 mL syringe until saturation was reached (as previously described in\nHegde et al. 2015; Coelho et al. 2022). Subsequently, we measured\nhemispherical reflectance from 400\u20132500 nm at intervals of 1 nm, using three\ndetectors: a 512-element silicon photodiode array (up to 1000 nm) and two\nindium\u2013gallium\u2013arsenide photodiodes (1000\u20131800 and 1800\u20132500 nm) using an ASD\nFieldSpec 4 Spectrometer coupled with an ASD integrating sphere (as described\nin detail in Hegde et al. 2015; Coelho et al. 2022). Measuring the reflectance\nof the biopigments using an integrating sphere mimics the observing geometry\nof an exoplanet (as previously described in Hegde et al. 2015).\n\nDry biopigments show stronger reflectance than fresh samples (see also Coelho\net al. 2022) and thus we measured the same sample twice: immediately after\ndeposition on the filter (referred to as \u2018fresh\u2019) and after a week at the\nbenchtop in the dark (referred to as \u2018dry\u2019). Filters with only culture media\nserved as controls.\n\n### 2.3. Data generation and simulations\n\nWe used the established Exo-Prime II model (see e.g. Kaltenegger, Lin and\nRugheimer 2020; Madden and Kaltenegger 2020) to generate high-resolution\natmospheric spectra with a minimum resolution of \u03bb/\u0394\u03bb = 100 000. We chose a\nslightly colder modern Earth for our analysis with an average surface\ntemperature of 273 K to allow for a wide range of surface conditions, using\nmodern Earth outgassing rates (e.g. Rugheimer et al. 2013; Kaltenegger and Lin\n2021) and a 10 per cent decreased solar irradiation to account for a planet\nthat could be covered with liquid or frozen water. This slightly colder\natmosphere does not show significant changes in spectral features compared to\nmodern Earth, except for slightly reduced water features due to the lower\nhumidity of the atmosphere. However, these slight differences do not influence\nour analysis of the effect of surface biota on the spectra.\n\nOcean and snow surface albedo have been selected from the United States\nGeological Survey (USGS) Spectra Library (Clark et al. 2003), and the single-\nlayer cloud albedo is based on the 20 \u03bcm MODIS model (King et al. 1997; Rossow\nand Schiffer 1999) following previous work (see e.g. (Madden and Kaltenegger\n2020; Pham and Kaltenegger 2021, 2022).\n\nWe resampled the high resolution of the reflectance spectra of Earth-like\nexoplanets and the low-resolution biota (Fig. 3), cloud, ocean, and snow\nalbedos using the Python spectres 2.2.0 package (Carnall, 2017).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nModelled reflectance spectra of Earth-like planets (top) for a frozen planet\ncovered with 100 per cent dry biota (i) and a snowball planet covered with 50\nper cent dry biota and 50 per cent snow (ii), which increases the overall\nreflectivity slightly. Adding a 50 per cent cloud cover (2nd row, iii and iv)\nreduces the overall reflectivity of these cold worlds due to the lower albedo\nof clouds compared to snow and the dry biota (see Fig. S1). The models of an\nocean world (100 per cent fresh biota) and an Earth-analogue planet (70 per\ncent ocean and 30 per cent fresh biota) (3rd row, v and vi) show that the\noverall reflectivity of the planet decreases due to the lower reflectivity of\nthe fresh biota as well as the low reflectivity of oceans compared to frozen\nworlds. Adding clouds to the planet (bottom, vii and viii) increases the\noverall reflectivity of the models because clouds reflect more light than\noceans or fresh biota. Labels: a \u2013 Chl-a Soret band, b \u2013 Carotenoids, c \u2013\nChl-a Q_x band, d \u2013 Phycobilins, e \u2013 Chl-a Q_y band, f \u2013 BChl-a Soret band, g\n\u2013 BChl-a, b Q_x band, h \u2013 BChl-a Q_y band, and i \u2013 BChl-b Q_y band (Table S2).\nAtmospheric absorption features: O_3 \u2013 450 to 740 nm, O_2 \u2013 690, 760, and 1260\nnm, and H_2O \u2013 950, 1150, 1490, and 1900 nm.\n\nWe resampled the low-resolution biota, cloud, ocean, and snow albedos to R =\n140 (comparable to the HWO concept, Fig. S2) and R = 100 000, comparable to\nhigh-resolution instruments such as ELTs (Fig. S3). Our exoplanet models\ncontain reflectance spectra of frozen worlds and snowball planets, Earth-\nanalogues, and ocean worlds with a different surface coverage of purple\nbacteria for atmospheres with and without clouds.\n\n## 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTo expand our baseline for finding life in the cosmos, we have measured the\nreflectance of purple bacteria that thrive across a range of anoxic and oxic\nenvironments. We present the samples in Fig. 1, the reflectance of the\nbiopigments in Fig. 2, and the model reflectance spectra of Earth-like\nexoplanets dominated by a range of such purple biota in Fig. 3.\n\nIn Fig. 1, we show 23 purple bacteria samples, originating from oxic to anoxic\nconditions. Despite being generally referred to as \u2018purple,\u2019 these organisms\ncan exhibit a wide range of colours as shown here, including yellow, orange,\nbrown, or even red due to the presence of different carotenoids. Fig. 2 shows\nthe distinct reflectivity of the 23 purple bacteria measured in both fresh and\ndry conditions. The main features can be identified in the spectra range\nbetween 400\u20131100 nm. Our spectra show a minimum resolution of 125 comparable\nto the intended resolution of the Habitable World Observatory [R = 140\n(\u03bb/\u0394\u03bb)]. We resampled the data to R = 140 (Fig. S2) showing no significant\nchanges in the biota signatures. Fig. 2 (top) shows the reflectance spectra of\nthe purple cyanobacterium G. violaceus compared to that of Anabaena sp., a\ntypical blue-green cyanobacterium, both of which thrive in oxygen-rich\nenvironments. Despite inhabiting similar biomes, the purple-coloured\ncyanobacterium G. violaceus exhibits a distinct reflectance spectrum. The\nAnabaena sp. reflectance spectrum is characterized by a prominent Chlorophyll\na (Chl-a) peak at 548 nm (see Table S2), a typical reflectance signature of\norganisms with a high Chl-a content (see Coelho et al. 2022, Fig. 2). Both\ncyanobacteria have Chl-a absorption features at 437\u2013439 and 675\u2013677 nm and a\nphycobilin absorption feature at 620\u2013624 nm, typical of cyanobacteria. Purple\ncyanobacteria produce distinct carotenoids (440\u2013550 nm), G. violaceus spectrum\n(Fig 2 top) displays distinct carotenoid absorption features at 500 and 560 nm\n(visible in dry samples) in the spectrum. Fig 2 (top) also shows some overlaps\nof biopigment features between the biota: echinenone, a carotenoid usually\npresent in Gloeobacter absorbs at 440 nm and is similar to the Soret band of\nChl-a. Similarly, Anabaena sp. presents an absorption feature at 488 nm that\nagrees with the reference peak of canthaxanthin, another carotenoid (Takaichi\net al. 2005).\n\nIn addition to oxic environments (Fig. 2 top), we show the reflectivity of\npurple bacteria that grow under different conditions: PNSB adapted to\nenvironments with limited oxygen (Fig. 2 middle) and PSB in anoxic conditions\n(Fig. 2 bottom). In both panels part of the BChl Soret bands can be seen at\n400\u2013420 nm. In PSB and PNSB, BChl-a and -b Qy bands are present in the near-IR\n(800\u20131100 nm). The BChl-a spectral Q-band features exhibit minimal variability\namong organisms, with absorption features at 800\u2013805 nm and 850\u2013855 nm typical\nof PNSB and PSB (Kimura et al. 2023). BChl b displays a considerably different\nQ band, with the position of the peaks ranging from 820 to 1100 nm. Note that\nFig. 2 (middle) displays a PNSB (B. viridis) that absorbs at 1010 nm and can\nuse this energy for phototrophy, suggesting that ecosystems dominated by\npurple biota may be more likely to exist on planets orbiting cooler M-stars\nthat provide stellar energy distribution peaking at longer, redder,\nwavelengths (as suggested previously by Wolstencroft and Raven 2002; Tinetti,\nRashby and Yung 2006; Kiang et al. 2007; Lehmer et al. 2021). See Table S2 for\ndetailed listing of the biopigments spectral signatures in purple bacteria.\n\nWe then simulated the reflectance spectra of Earth-like planets shown in Fig.\n3 for Earth-analogue planets (70 per cent ocean and 30 per cent land covered\nwith fresh biota), ocean worlds (covered with 100 per cent fresh biota),\nfrozen worlds (covered with 100 per cent dry biota) and snowball worlds\n(covered with 50 per cent dry biota and 50 per cent snow). We then added 50\nper cent cloud cover to show the effect of clouds on the reflectance spectra\n(see Fig. S1 for the albedos of snow, oceans, clouds, and the selected fresh\nand dry biota). Models of the reflectance spectra of Earth-like exoplanets\nshow a strong reflectivity for planetary models covered in dry biota and snow,\nbut lower reflectivity for planets with open oceans and fresh biota (see Fig.\n3). A snowball planet with 50 per cent dry biota and 50 per cent snow (Fig.\n3\u2013ii) shows the highest overall reflectivity due to the high reflectivity of\nsnow and dry biota (see Fig. S1).\n\nThe frozen planet models, covered with 100 per cent dry biota, show the second\nhighest reflectivity, only slightly lower than the snowball planet. Adding a\n50 per cent cloud cover (Fig. 3\u2013iii and \u2013iv) reduces the overall reflectivity\nof both models slightly due to the lower albedo of clouds compared to snow and\nthe dry biota. For Earth-analog models of a planet (70 per cent ocean and 30\nper cent land covered by fresh biota) and ocean worlds (100 per cent fresh\nbiota) (Fig. 3\u2013v and \u2013vi) the overall reflectivity is lower than for the\nprevious cases due to the lower reflectivity of the fresh biota compared to\nthe dry biota and the low reflectivity of oceans compared to snow. Adding\nclouds to the models (bottom) increases the overall reflectivity slightly\n(Fig. 3\u2013vii and \u2013viii).\n\nThere is an overlap between biopigments and atmospheric absorption features.\nB(Chl)-a Qy absorption features (680 nm for Chl-a and 800\u2013850 nm for BChl-a)\nare too close, in the lower and upper limit of O_2 (760 nm). Note that BChl-a\nQy of PSB (anoxic surfaces) has been reported to also absorb at 900\u2013963 nm\n(Kimura et al. 2023), which does not overlap with O_2, but may overlap with an\nintense H_2O feature at 950 nm. Similarly, BChl-b Qy absorption features far\nin the 1000 nm may overlap with the same H_2O feature. Carotenoids overlap\nwith O_3 (450\u2013740 nm) although in Fig. 3 that does not significantly mask the\nbiopigments features.\n\nBarrientos et al. (2023) showed changes in surface albedos provide vital and\nusable information for observations, even with a low signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nTheir quantitative work was applied to a general \u2018edge feature\u2019 in the\nspectrum, based on the specific biological surface albedo caused by green\nphotosynthetic organisms \u2013 the \u2018red edge\u2019 (Barrientos et al. 2023).\n\nTraditionally, the \u2018red edge\u2019 (e.g. Sagan et al. 1993; Seager et al. 2005;\nArnold 2008; O'Malley-James and Kaltenegger 2018, 2019) has been used as a\nsurface biosignature for modern Earth (see Fig. 2, top panel). However, a\nphotosynthesis \u2018red edge\u2019 is an advanced surface biosignature for life on\nEarth that may only have become detectable between 0.75 and 1.2 billion years\nago (O'Malley-James and Kaltenegger 2018). Sharp changes in the surface albedo\nin the visible range could have a similar observation promise (Barrientos et\nal. 2023). These results stress the importance of applying wavelength-\ndependent surface features to retrieval models to estimate atmospheric\nfeatures such as H_2O, O_2, and O_3 correctly. Future studies applying a\nsimilar quantitative method will determine the detectability of purple\nbacteria features.\n\nHere we extend our search for surface biosignatures to a much wider range of\nterrestrial exoplanet environments using biopigments of purple bacteria.\nFurther, we expand the type of habitats such biota could dominate including\nexoplanets with anoxic or microaerobic environments. Some spectral features of\n(B)Chl and carotenoids lie close to atmospheric features like H_2O and O_3;\nthus, the community needs to consider a diverse set of surface biopigments in\nthe retrieval models (Barrientos et al. 2023), not only to detect signs of\nlife but also to retrieved atmospheric features co-existing in the same\nwavelengths as surface features.\n\nIn this study, we focused on terrestrial Earth-like planets. Other types of\nproposed exoplanet environments, like Hycean planets, covered by oceans under\nsubstantial H_2 atmospheres (Madhusudhan, Piette and Constantinou 2021) could\nalso be promising candidates for purple bacterial ecosystems. Some purple\nbacteria organisms can use H_2 as a primary electron donor. Thus, the\nabundance of H_2 on these proposed planets may facilitate biomass production.\n\nThe distinct reflectivity of the biopigments of purple bacteria offers surface\nbiosignatures for a wide range of conditions \u2013 from oxic to anoxic conditions\n\u2013 to the point of detection with upcoming telescopes like ELTs or the\nHabitable World Telescope.\n\n## 4 CONCLUSIONS\n\nUsing life on Earth as our guide we identified purple bacteria as biota that\ncould dominate a wide range of environments on exoplanets.\n\nEspecially on exoplanets orbiting M-stars, purple bacteria could arguably be\ndominant because they can use red to infrared light to fuel photosynthesis.\nWhere chlorophyll-based photosynthesis thrives under the Sun's spectral energy\ndistribution, a range of purple bacteria could thrive under a red star's\nlight.\n\nWe provide a reflectance spectra data base of the biopigments of purple\nbacteria as a resource for modelers and observers to optimize search\nstrategies for life with upcoming telescopes. We expand the range of surface\nbiosignatures on potentially habitable exoplanets beyond the \u2018red edge\u2019\ntraditionally used to search for vegetation. Despite being generally referred\nto as purple bacteria, these organisms can exhibit a wide range of colours,\nincluding yellow, orange, brown, or red due to the presence of different\ncarotenoids, and could colour the surface of exoplanets in many shades.\n\nBased on these reflectance measurements we created an exoplanet data base of\nhigh-resolution reflectance spectra for Earth-like exoplanets including ocean\nworlds, Earth-analogues, frozen worlds, and snowball planets to explore the\neffects of purple bacteria on their overall reflectance spectra.\n\nOur models show that depending on the surface coverage of the biota and the\ncloud coverage, a wide variety of terrestrial planets could show signs of\npurple bacteria surface biopigments. While it is unknown whether life \u2013 or\npurple bacteria \u2013 can evolve on other worlds, purple might just be the new\ngreen in the search for surface life.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nLFC acknowledges the funding from Fulbright Schuman.
