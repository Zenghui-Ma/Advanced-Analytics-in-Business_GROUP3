It would be a new type of money in\naddition to the banknotes and coins we have today, and the electronic money in\nyour bank account,\u201d Director of Money and Cash \u2013 Tari Moni Whai Take Ian\nWoolford says.\n\n\u201cDigital cash would ensure that central bank money is available to all New\nZealanders and able to be used digitally. It would also help enable a money\nand payments system that is innovative, competitive and contributes to the\ndevelopment of New Zealand\u2019s digital economy.\n\n\u201cIt would be the first digital form of New Zealand currency backed by the\ngovernment and available to the public. Physical cash in banknotes and coins\nwould still be available, so people would have the option to use either\ndigital or physical cash.\n\n\u201cYou would likely need a digital wallet, payment card or phone app to access\nyour digital cash. You wouldn\u2019t need a commercial bank account to use it.\n\n\u201cInnovations in money and payments are challenging New Zealand\u2019s monetary\nsovereignty. Like cryptoassets, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and\ndigital currencies issued by global technology companies. New Zealand\u2019s money\nmust innovate to stay relevant and useful and ensure our monetary sovereignty.\n\n\u201cThere is also a huge opportunity for digital cash to support competition and\ninnovation by enabling our powerful fintech sector.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll to continue reading\n\n\u201cDigital cash would be mainly used for payments by individuals and businesses,\nto pay online, instore, or even to pay your child\u2019s pocket money in the same\nway you can use cash currently. You could use it to do new things like make an\ninstant digital payment to anyone in New Zealand. Today, New Zealanders still\ncannot make instant payments electronically to other people, unless they are\nboth with the same bank.\n\n\u201cIt would also work via Bluetooth, so you could make payments without\nconnecting to internet. This would be useful in an emergency, or when the\npower is out.\n\nDigital cash would be private, secure, and trusted \u2013 the Reserve Bank will not\ncontrol or see how you spend your money.\n\n\u201cJust like physical cash, digital cash would be denominated in New Zealand\ndollars and issued by the Reserve Bank. It could be swapped 1:1 with physical\ncash, and other forms of NZD, like the electronic money in your bank account,\u201d\nMr Woolford says.\n\n\u201cWe are planning for a future in New Zealand that has less cash, but not one\nthat is cash-less. We are committed to continuing to make cash available in\nforms that New Zealanders want to use.\u201d\n\nMany New Zealanders are using physical cash less and finding it harder to\naccess. Our latest survey on cash use is out soon and shows cash use declined\nfast under Covid and is not increasing.\n\nWe want New Zealanders to tell us what they think before we design how digital\ncash will work. What are the challenges, benefits, and concerns for you?\n\nConsultation is open 17 April until 26 July 2024.\n\n## Key information\n\n  * The Reserve Bank of New Zealand - Te P\u016btea Matua is exploring a central bank digital currency.
