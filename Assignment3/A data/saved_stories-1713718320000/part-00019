Life in Mercer is unrecognisable to\nthat which came earlier \u2013 The bombs saw to that. Humanity may never fully\nrecover... Adventure beckons once more, and you are ready to answer its call!\n\nHow To\n\nMercer is the home of a Fallout inspired adventure game\n\nThere are two key game components to understand to get maximum fun:\n\n  1. Mapping and Questing\n  2. Battling\n\nMapping and Questing\n\nThe \u2018Map\u2019 tab is the central hub of this game \u2013 where you and your party will\nseek to save Mercer from the latest threat. \u2013 You and your party are\nrepresented by the Red Circle\n\n  * Towns/Shelter (and quest locations) are in purple\n  * Moveable land is in green (light green for plains, dark green for farmland)\n  * You can move your party using the arrow buttons (CellsAZ2-BB6)\n  * if you are ever stuck \u2013 refer back to the quest log for clues, or head to the nearest town to see if that will help!\n\nBattle Mode\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nNote \u2013 If at any stage the battle mode seems too hard. Start a new campaign\nwith \u2018Disable Battle\u2019 mode switched to yes, this will disable all battles and\nallow for peaceful adventuring/questing.\n\nBattles can leave your party outnumbered \u2013 anywhere between 1 to 5 enemies\nwill spawn to fight your party \u2013 so be prepared at all times!\n\nBattles use a simplified version of DnD mechanics, with four features\nimportant to understand:\n\n1\\. Initiative: The world of Mercer uses turn based battle mechanics. This\nmeans each creature takes it in turn to move and attack. The order of this is\ndefined by an initiative dice roll, where the highest roll gets to go first.\nThis order is set in the first round of combat and stays consistent throughout\nthe battle\n\n2\\. Range and Movement: Battles take place on a wide battle arena, where\ndistance is important. Eacg ceature has their own movement they can achieve\neach turn, as well as different ranges of attack. You can only attack a\ncreature if you are within range.\n\nMelee creatures for example can only attack when they are next to another\ncreature, but ranged attacks can benefit from being at a distance Make sure to\ntrack the distance between your party and your enemy!\n\n3\\. Hitting an Enemy : Once you are in range of attacking the enemy, we now\nneed to see if your attack hits or not. This hit roll is all based on armour\nclass and randomly probability. If your roll falls below the enemy armour\nclass, the attack will miss.\n\n4\\. Damage Calculation Each weapon and attack move has the capability of\nhitting a range of daThrower. This daThrower scales with your level Details on\nwhat dice and bonuses are added to your attack role are shown on the Character\nStats screen (accessible via the map)\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * More\n\n  * Tumblr\n\nLike Loading...\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nThe Storyteller\n\nWriting\n\ngaming, nintendo, reviews, rpg, Video Games\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * The StoryTeller\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
