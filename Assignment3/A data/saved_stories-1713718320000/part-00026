(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nPeople on TikTok have developed a specific accent - would you recognise it if\nyou heard it?\n\nBefore I switch on the ringlight, even before I've loaded my battery into my\ncamera, I already know what I'm going to say. I press record, look at the\nlens, and deliver my script. In about seven minutes it's all done \u2013 a new\nvideo for TikTok. Afterwards, I think no more about the words that I've said,\nand certainly not the way I delivered them. At least, until now.\n\nIt turns out there may be a \"TikTok voice\". It apparently includes \"uptalk\" \u2013\na rising intonation on declarative sentences \u2013 and \"vocal fry\": a soft creak\nas you speak.\n\nIf you want to know what that sounds like, I explained in this video for\nTikTok:\n\nWhat does Tiktok voice sound like?\n\nSo, if \"TikTok voice\" really is a thing, how did it emerge, and who tends to\nuse it?\n\nThe phenomenon of \"influencer speak\" predates TikTok \u2013 linguistic quirks have\nemerged on YouTube or Instagram for well over a decade. But the app's low\nbarrier to entry has created significantly more creators. And crucially, more\nof them are female than male.\n\nIn a media interview last month, Christopher Strelluf, an associate professor\nof linguistics at the University of Warwick, suggested that TikTok voice is\nparticularly associated with young women \u2013 who are often linguistic\ninnovators. \"The way young women use language is the future of the way\nlanguage evolves. So any changes we hear by young women are probably the\nfuture of English,\" he told NationalWorld, a British news publisher.\n\nResearch has consistently found this to be the case; several studies have\nsuggested men have historically lagged behind women by a whole generation when\nit comes to linguistic change.\n\nChristian Ilbury, a lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of\nEdinburgh, suggests that these speech patterns may have emerged because it\nallows creators to \"hold the conversational floor\".\n\nIn my experience as a TikTok creator, uptalk can sound more persuasive and\npersonal. \"Sociolinguistic research shows that the speaker is using uptalk as\na rhetorical device to keep you engaged in the discourse,\" says Ilbury. A low-\npitched, declarative monotone, by contrast, would be flatter and less\nengaging. (This echoes a tip I once heard when I was training for radio\nbroadcasting earlier in my career: I was advised to 'never sound like you're\nfinishing a sentence'. The idea is that the listener is encouraged to stay\ntuned in.)\n\nGetty Images\n\nDo you have TikTok voice? (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nYet one of the curious elements of this style of speaking is that both uptalk\nand creaky voice are wildly vilified. Some people seem to associate uptalk\nwith uncertainty or a lack of authority. And when I looked up a definition of\nvocal fry online, one of the first Google search results from a website called\nVoices told me \"vocal fry is demeaning, condescending and aloof. It's the\nperfect vocalisation for an unlikable character.\"\n\nSome commenters on the video I made for TikTok about it were also not fans.\n\"Vocal fry seems to be getting worse in the US for sure,\" said one. \"The\nrising intonation implies a question or ignorance,\" said another.\n\nYou may also like:\n\n  * The problems with TikTok's controversial 'beauty filters'\n  * The complicated truth about body image and social media\n  * Is social media bad for you? The knowns and unknowns\n\nIt's not quite true that vocal fry is getting more prevalent. A systematic\nreview in 2020 actually found that \"widespread claims of its recent increase\namong young American women have not been empirically confirmed\".\n\n\"In the case of vocal fry, teenage girls in English-language speech\ncommunities might use vocal fry more than other groups of people,\" says\nStrelluf, but \"findings in academic research are mixed\".\n\nThere is the catch: women may be pioneering in a linguist's eyes, but research\nsuggests they are more likely to be perceived negatively when using linguistic\npatterns like vocal fry or uptalk compared with men. In one small study,\npeople rated female speakers with vocal fry as less attractive and intelligent\nthan female speakers without it. They didn't distinguish between men who spoke\nwith different \"fries\". Another study showed that vocal fry hurts women's\ncareer prospects. And a third found that women with vocal fry were perceived\nas more neurotic than those without.\n\nIt's definitely just prejudice, nothing to do with content. There is nothing\nwrong with the way young women's voices sound \u2013 Deborah Cameron\n\nStrelluf says that once people decide a linguistic feature has a\nsociolinguistic feature \u2013 that uptalk sounds indecisive, for instance \u2013 they\nthen start to notice it more. It is textbook confirmation bias.\n\nDeborah Cameron, a linguist at the University of Oxford, says: \"It's\ndefinitely just prejudice, nothing to do with content. There is nothing wrong\nwith the way young women's voices sound\".\n\nIn her upcoming book Language, Sexism and Misogyny, Cameron writes that\ncriticisms of uptalk almost exclusively focus on women, and that this can have\ndamaging consequences. \"Women can and do push back against this kind of\ncriticism,\" she says, \"but for every woman who gives it 'zero priority', there\nwill be others who internalise the message that the way they speak is a\nproblem, and that by not addressing it they are 'holding themselves back'.\"\n\nCameron ends her analysis of criticisms of uptalk and vocal fry by saying:\n\"This is the paradox at the heart of advice telling women to speak with\nconfidence: the more women are told that the way they speak is holding them\nback, the less confident they will feel.\"\n\nStrelluf agrees that language judgements are usually personal. \"Our\nevaluations of language are almost always really evaluations of people,\" he\nsays. \"For instance, we often say that French sounds 'romantic'. But there's\nnothing inherently romantic about French \u2013 half of French vowels are said in\nthe nose, which should be decidedly unromantic.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nTikTok has developed its own language patterns in terms of word choice too\n(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAnother way that TikTok is influencing language is through the choice of words\npeople use. In his research, Ilbury describes the sorts of speech patterns we\nencounter on social video as \"digital style\", which has different mimetic\nsubgenres. If you want to make a video about what you ate today, for example,\nan experienced TikTokker knows to say \"What I ate in a day\" right at the top\nof the video. If you want to talk about your family home's distinctively\nMexican memorabilia, you know to start the video by saying: \"Things in my\nMexican family home that just make sense.\"\n\n\"In order for it to be recognised, there are stylistic and semiotic things you\nhave to do, and if you think about TikTok videos as organised into meme\ngenres, they have to have certain elements you recognise as belonging to that\ngenre,\" Ilbury says. \"One of those things is language.\"\n\nSo, TikTok creators are not only deploying linguistic features known for\ndriving engagement; their words and intonations are building out entire meme\ngenres too.\n\nDiscovering all this, I'm now aware that I might have developed a touch of\nTikTok voice myself. But if someone comments negatively about that on my own\nvideos, I'll remember that it says a lot more about them than it does about\nme.\n\n*Sophia Smith Galer is a journalist and content creator on TikTok and Instagram.\n\n\\--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your\ninbox every Friday.\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter\nor Instagram.\n\nFeatures\n\nInternet\n\nSocial media\n\nRelated\n\n## Where to find the best cheesesteaks in Philly\n\n18 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n## 12 stunning buildings that bring nature inside\n\n19 hrs ago\n\nCulture\n\n## The rise and fall and possible rise of the oyster\n\n22 hrs ago\n\nFuture\n\nMore\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Women secretly filmed on nights out 'feel unsafe'\n\nThe videos taken of women on nights out without their knowledge have gained\nmillions of views.\n\n2 days ago\n\nManchester\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Almost a quarter of kids aged 5-7 have smartphones\n\nThe regulator calls the data a \"wake up call\", and says parents and industry\nneed to do more.\n\n2 days ago\n\nTechnology\n\n3 days ago\n\n## TikTok star tries Hull chip spice and loves it\n\nHe was filmed enjoying chips and a pattie, with a touch of the iconic\ncondiment.\n\n3 days ago\n\nHull & East Yorkshire\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Church speaks out after Facebook craft fair scam\n\nSt Mary's Church said a Facebook post about a summer fair and asking people\nfor money is not real.\n\n3 days ago\n\nHull & East Yorkshire\n\n4 days ago\n\n## EU demands answers on money-for-views version of TikTok\n\nThe platform has been given 24 hours to provide information about the\npotential risks of TikTok Lite.\n\n4 days ago\n\nEurope\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
