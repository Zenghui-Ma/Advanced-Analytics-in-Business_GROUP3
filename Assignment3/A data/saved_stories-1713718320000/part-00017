It\ncan create super realistic or stylized clips of video footage up to 60 seconds\nin length purely based on user text prompts.\n\n## The marvel of gen AI comes at a steep cost\n\n\u201cIt takes 100,000 AI chips working at full compute capacity and full power\nconsumption in order to train Sora,\u201d Badani said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge amount.\u201d\n\nData centers, where most AI models are trained, currently account for 2% of\nglobal electricity consumption, according to Badani. But with generative AI\nexpected to go mainstream, she predicts it could end up devouring a quarter of\nall power in the United States in 2030.\n\nThe solution to this conundrum is to develop semiconductor chips that are\noptimized to run on a minimum of energy.\n\nThat\u2019s where Arm comes in: Its RISC processor designs currently run on 99% of\nall smartphones, as opposed to the rival x86 architecture developed by Intel.\nThe latter has been a standard for desktop PCs, but proved too inefficient to\nrun battery-powered handheld devices like smartphones and tablets.\n\nArm is adopting that same design philosophy for AI.\n\n\u201cIf you think about AI, it comes with a cost,\u201d Badani said, \u201cand that cost is\nunfortunately power.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
