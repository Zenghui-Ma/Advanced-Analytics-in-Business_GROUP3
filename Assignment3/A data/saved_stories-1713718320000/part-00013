But no\none shook me by the shoulders, saying how crazy that was. I needed Lewis\nThomas, who wrote in The Medusa and the Snail:\n\n> For the real amazement, if you wish to be amazed, is this process. You start\n> out as a single cell derived from the coupling of a sperm and an egg; this\n> divides in two, then four, then eight, and so on, and at a certain stage\n> there emerges a single cell which has as all its progeny the human brain.\n> The mere existence of such a cell should be one of the great astonishments\n> of the earth. People ought to be walking around all day, all through their\n> waking hours calling to each other in endless wonderment, talking of nothing\n> except that cell.\n\nI wish my high school biology teacher had asked the class how an embryo could\npossibly differentiate\u2014and then paused to let us really think about it. The\nwhole subject is in the answer to that question. A chemical gradient in the\nembryonic fluid is enough of a signal to slightly alter the gene expression\nprogram of some cells, not others; now the embryo knows \u201cup\u201d from \u201cdown\u201d;\ncells at one end begin producing different proteins than cells at the other,\nand these, in turn, release more refined chemical signals; ...; soon, you have\nbrain cells and foot cells.\n\nHow come we memorized chemical formulas but didn\u2019t talk about that? It was\nonly in college, when I read Douglas Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach, that I\ncame to understand cells as recursively self-modifying programs. The language\nalone was evocative. It suggested that the embryo\u2014DNA making RNA, RNA making\nprotein, protein regulating the transcription of DNA into RNA\u2014was like a small\nLisp program, with macros begetting macros begetting macros, the source code\ncontaining within it all of the instructions required for life on Earth. Could\nanything more interesting be imagined?\n\nSomeone should have said this to me:\n\n> Imagine a flashy spaceship lands in your backyard. The door opens and you\n> are invited to investigate everything to see what you can learn. The\n> technology is clearly millions of years beyond what we can make.\n>\n> This is biology.\n>\n> \u2013Bert Hubert, \u201cOur Amazing Immune System\u201d\n\nIn biology class, biology wasn\u2019t presented as a quest for the secrets of life.\nThe textbooks wrung out the questing. We were nowhere acquainted with real\nbiologists, the real questions they had, the real experiments they did to\nanswer them. We were just given their conclusions.\n\nThe Roche Biochemical Pathways PosterPlans for an alien machine, in Contact\n\nFor instance I never learned that a man named Oswald Avery, in the 1940s,\npuzzled over two cultures of Streptococcus bacteria. One had a rough texture\nwhen grown in a dish; the other was smooth, and glistened. Avery noticed that\nwhen he mixed the smooth strain with the rough strain, every generation after\nwas smooth, too. Heredity in a dish. What made it work? This was one of the\nmost exciting mysteries of the time\u2014in fact of all time.\n\nMost experts thought that protein was somehow responsible, that traits were\nencoded soupily, via differing concentrations of chemicals. Avery suspected a\nrole for nucleic acid. So, he did an experiment, one we could have replicated\non our benches in school. Using just a centrifuge, water, detergent, and acid,\nhe purified nucleic acid from his smooth strep culture. Precipitated with\nalcohol, it became fibrous. He added a tiny bit of it to the rough culture,\nand lo, that culture became smooth in the following generations. This fibrous\nstuff, then, was \u201cthe transforming principle\u201d\u2014the long-sought agent of\nheredity. Avery\u2019s experiment set off a frenzy of work that, a decade later,\nended in the discovery of the double helix.\n\nIn his \u201cMathematician\u2019s Lament,\u201d Paul Lockhart describes how school cheapens\nmathematics by robbing us of the questions. We\u2019re not just asked, hey, how\nmuch of the triangle takes up the box?\n\nThat\u2019s a puzzle we might delight in. (If you drop a vertical from the top of\nthe triangle, you end up with two rectangles cut in half; you discover that\nthe area inside the triangle is equal to the area outside.) Instead, we\u2019re\ntold that if you ever find yourself wanting the area of a triangle, here\u2019s the\nprocedure:\n\nBiology is like that, but worse because it\u2019s a messier subject. The facts seem\nextra arbitrary. We\u2019re told to distinguish \u201clipid bilayers\u201d from \u201cendoplasmic\nreticula\u201d without understanding why we care about either in the first place.\n\nEnormous subjects are best approached in thin, deep slices. I discovered this\nwhen first learning how to program. The textbooks never worked; it all only\nstarted to click when I started to do little projects for myself. The project\nwasn\u2019t just motivation but an organizing principle, a magnet to arrange the\nrandom iron filings I picked up along the way. I\u2019d care to learn about some\nabstract concept, like \u201cmemoization,\u201d because I needed it to solve my problem;\nand these concepts would lose their abstractness in the light of my example.\n\nBiology is no different. Learning begins with questions. How do embryos\ndifferentiate? Why are my eyes blue? How does a hamster turn cheese into\nmuscle? Why does the coronavirus make some people much sicker than others?\n\n*\n\nA few months ago, I started a magazine assignment to answer some questions\nabout SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system. I encountered paragraphs like this:\n\n> In low-MOI infections (MOI, 0.2), exogenous expression of ACE2 enabled SARS-\n> CoV-2 to replicate and comprise ~54% of the total reads mapping more than\n> 300x coverage across the ~30-kb genome (Figures 1A and 1B). Western blot\n> analyses corroborated these RNA-seq data... It is noteworthy that, despite\n> this dramatic increase in viral load, we observed neither activation of\n> TBK1, the kinase responsible for IFN-I and IFN-III expression, nor induction\n> of STAT1 and MX1, IFN-I-stimulated genes (Figure S1A; Sharma et al.,\n> 2003)...\n>\n> \u2013\u201cImbalanced Host Response to SARS-CoV-2 Drives Development of COVID-19,\u201d\n> Cell\n\nIt was hard to get through a sentence without having to consult Wikipedia. In\nimmunology in particular the nomenclature is expansive. One sentence might\nrefer to \u201cleukocytes,\u201d the next to monocytes, the next to lymphocytes. There\nare a lot of squares-and-rectangles situations: all interleukins are\ncytokines, but not all cytokines are interleukins?\n\nI\u2019ve never come across a subject so fractal in its complexity. It reminds me\nof computing that way. A day of programming might involve constructing an\nelaborate regular expression, investigating a file descriptor leak, debugging\na race condition in the application you just wrote, and thinking through the\ninterface of a module. Everywhere you look\u2014the compiler, the shell, the CPU,\nthe DOM\u2014is an abstraction hiding lifetimes of work. Biology is like this, just\nmuch, much worse, because living systems aren\u2019t intentionally designed. It\u2019s\nall a big slop of global mutable state. Control is achieved by upregulating\nthis thing while turning down the promoter of that thing\u2019s repressor. You\nthink you know how something works\u2014like when I thought I had a handle on the\nneutrophil, an important front-line player in the innate immune system\u2014only to\nlearn that it comes in several flavors, and more are still being discovered,\nand some of them seem to do the opposite of the ones you thought you knew.\nEverything in biology is like this. It\u2019s all exceptions to the rule.\n\nBut biology, like computing, has a bottom, and the bottom is not abstract.\nIt\u2019s physical. It\u2019s shapes bumping into each other. In fact the great\nrevelation of twentieth-century molecular biology was the coupling of\nstructure to function. An aperiodic crystal that forms paired helices is the\nnatural store of heredity because of its ability to curl up and unwind and\ndouble itself with complements. Hemoglobin, the first protein studied in full\ncrystallographic detail, was shown to be an efficient store of energy because\nof how oxygen atoms snap into its body like Legos, each snap widening the\nremaining slots, so that it loads itself up practically at a gulp. Most\nproteins are like this. The ones that drive locomotion twist like little\nmotors; the ones that contract muscles climb and compress each other. Cells,\ntoo, are constantly in conversation, and the language they speak is shape.\nIt\u2019s keys entering locks: a protein might straddle the cell membrane, and when\na cytokine (that\u2019s a kind of signaling molecule) docks with it, it changes its\nshape, so that its grip loosens on some other molecule on the interior side of\nthe membrane, as though fumbling a football\u2014that football might be a signal\nitself, on its way to the nucleus.\n\nI think my understanding of biology was too flow-charty in high school. I knew\nthat DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 protein and that this was called \u201cgene expression,\u201d but I was\nconfused on the basics, like, how did genes actually \u201cturn on\u201d? And once they\nwere on, were they on for good? It\u2019s clearer when you think physically.\nMammalian DNA isn\u2019t laid out as one long double helix; it\u2019s tightly coiled and\ncoiled again, like this, around little circular proteins called histones:\n\nDNA curled around histones. Image from this Moderna video, at 1:10\n\nThe structure of the resulting fiber has an effect on which genes are\nexpressed. This is because the little molecular machine that transcribes DNA\ninto RNA has to actually ride along the helix, and it can only ride along some\nparts of it, namely the parts that aren\u2019t curled up out of sight. \u201cExpressing\u201d\na gene just means that at a given moment, the machine is accessing a specific\nportion of DNA, resulting in lots of RNA transcripts, resulting in lots of the\nprotein that the gene codes for. Kink the fiber a bit and you change what the\nmachine can see, thus changing the distribution of proteins it produces. You\nhave \u201creprogrammed\u201d the cell. (There are many ways to control gene expression,\nmaybe the most common being \u201crepressors\u201d that park somewhere on the DNA,\nphysically blocking the transcription machinery.)\n\nOne of the workhorse techniques in modern biology, called RNA sequencing, or\nRNA-seq for short, takes a frozen cell and counts the RNA transcripts inside\nit. In effect you get a snapshot of all the proteins being expressed at that\nmoment. The result is literally a big table mapping genes to transcript\ncounts. You see that being one kind of cell versus another\u2014or being in one\nkind of cellular mood versus another, say in health versus disease\u2014is just a\nmatter of having a different distribution across this table. RNA-seq results\nare often represented as vectors in high-dimensional space, the counts in the\ntable forming the coordinates; cells move through this expression space as\nthey self-regulate and adapt to their environment.\n\n*\n\nHow do you develop a physical understanding of biology? I like pictures. One\nof my favorite books is called The Machinery of Life, by David Goodsell. It\u2019s\nfull of gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations. Here a bacterium\u2019s flagellar motor\nis shown in context, then zoomed in on in an inset, with a third picture\nhighlighting its functional elements:\n\nWhat makes the book work is that it\u2019s basically a re-introduction to molecular\nbiology with the following premise: the cell is a very fast and crowded place,\nfull of little machines, most of them protein, which you understand by taking\na close look. It does an especially terrific job through insets like the above\nrelating things at different scales. \u201cImagine your room filled with grains of\nrice. That will give you an idea of the billion or so cells that make up your\nfingertip.\u201d\n\nThe writing is very good. It somehow gets you imagining the motion of these\nmachines. It\u2019s tempting when thinking about the cellular world to simply\nminiaturize our own; but at the cellular scale things behave weirdly. Movement\nis essentially by random diffusion. \u201cThe motions and the interactions of\nbiological molecules are completely dominated by the surrounding water\nmolecules... Inside the cell, [a] protein is battered from all sides by water\nmolecules. It bounces back and forth, always at great speed, but takes a long\ntime to get anywhere.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that random diffusion is an incredibly slow way to travel large\ndistances, but an incredibly fast way to explore at short distances. Being a\nprotein inside a cell is like being at a crowded house party where it might\ntake an hour to get across the room, but by the time you get there you\u2019ve\nbumped into everybody six hundred thousand times.\n\nThis point is made beautifully in another favorite book of mine, A Computer\nScientist\u2019s Guide to Cell Biology, by William W. Cohen:\n\n> Molecules that come close to an organelle tend to remain close to it for a\n> while, and brush against it many times\u2014Figure 20 gives some intuitions as to\n> why this is true.\n\n> The result of this is that if receptors for a protein p cover even a small\n> fraction of the surface of an organelle, the organelle will be surprisingly\n> efficient at recognizing p. As an example, if only 0.02% of a typical\n> eukaryotic cell\u2019s surface has a receptor for p, the cell will be about half\n> as efficient as if the entire surface were coated with receptors for p.\n\nThis is the kind of fact that instantly clarifies how biology could possibly\nwork. \u201cCell-sized objects thus have a \u2018high bandwidth,\u2019\u201d Cohen writes. \u201cThey\ncan recognize or absorb hundreds of different chemical signals, even if they\nare bounded by membranes.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s book is pitched as an attempt to distill what he learned in acquiring\na \u201creading knowledge\u201d of biology\u2014enough to be able to follow along with a\npaper in Cell. He\u2019s very good at explaining methods: how do biologists know\nwhat they know? For a computer scientist, a biologist\u2019s methods can seem\ninsane; the trouble comes from the fact that cells are too small, too\nnumerous, too complex to analyze the way a programmer would, say in a step-by-\nstep debugger. What biologists mostly do is stuff like:\n\n  * Spin things to 15,000 Gs in centrifuges to separate pieces having different densities.\n  * Separate things of different sizes using gels and magnets. (\u201cGel electrophoresis.\u201d)\n  * Take one of those gels and blot it with special paper to splay the parts out. Then wash the paper with an antibody that binds to a specific protein. Finally, wash the paper with another antibody that binds to the first one, and fluoresces when it does so. See where the meta-antibody lights up\u2014that\u2019s the protein you were looking for. (I think I\u2019m describing a \u201cWestern blot.\u201d)\n  * Use the fluorescent antibody trick to tag cells expressing one or more proteins of interest. Then squeeze the cells through a tube so small that only one fits at a time. As each cell passes by, shine a laser through it to read its fluorescent tags, and use an electric charge to redirect it to a particular bin. Now you can sort and count cells that match your criteria. (\u201cFlow cytometry.\u201d)\n  * Genetically alter microorganisms to make molecular machines to spec; systematically turn off one gene at a time in a cell line and see what changes; edit the genome of a whole animal, and observe its life.\n\nCohen found, and I have too, that in trying to acquire a reading knowledge of\nbiology it\u2019s almost more useful to study the methods than any individual\nfacts. That\u2019s because the methods are highly conserved across studies.\nEverybody does Western blots. Everybody does flow cytometry and RNA-seq.\nYou\u2019ll see this stuff in every paper. (Or variations on the same themes:\nseparation, sorting, selection, genetic manipulation.)\n\nSo that\u2019s the foundation. Or almost: I have left for last my favorite resource\nof all, an incredible book called The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the\nRevolution in Biology, by Horace Freeland Judson. Parts of this book were\nserialized in the New Yorker in the 1970s. It is the Power Broker of biology,\na tomic masterwork. It is not just comprehensive\u2014Judson had hundreds of\nconversations with Francis Crick, with Jacques Monod and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, with\ntheir friends and spouses and colleagues; he read every paper, he read all\ntheir letters\u2014but it pulls no punches scientifically. Judson always just\ndescribes the real thing.\n\nAnd he emphasizes wrong turns. For example, before the discovery of tRNA\u2014the\nadapter molecules that link triplets of RNA bases to the amino acids they code\nfor\u2014there was much confusion. It was widely believed that there had to be some\nkind of punctuation, because how else would one know where to start\ntranscribing, or how to delimit one codon from the next? Certain mental models\nwere ingrained: a going theory was that RNA formed specially shaped pockets\nfor the different amino acids. The idea was that if you zoomed in on each\ntriplet or quartet or whatever (the scheme was then unknown), it would always\nform the same unique shape that only one kind of amino acid could fit into.\nThe amino acid chain would be formed right there alongside the RNA strand,\nusing it almost as a mold. This was thought to happen in the nucleus. The idea\nthat protein synthesis happened via an adapter, and that the nucleic acids\ntherefore acted less like a mold than a digital code, more purely\ninformation\u2014this was a major surprise.\n\n> Sitting on the grass at Woods Hole, Crick was talking about genes and\n> proteins, in particular about his assumption that they were colinear and\n> Benzer and Brenner\u2019s plan to show as much, when Ephrussi took him aback by\n> asking how he knew that amino acids were not put in their primary sequence\n> by something in the cytoplasm. . . . \u201cI don\u2019t think Boris necessarily\n> believed it, but it was an idea he thought wasn\u2019t impossible.\u201d\n>\n> . . .\n>\n> Crick also cast his skeptical eye over Watson and Rich\u2019s attempts to build\n> models of RNA. \u201cOf course, you realize that our ideas on that were totally\n> wrong. We thought that RNA had some structure with the twenty cavities, it\n> was that period. Mm-hmm. Unfortunately people have forgotten what it is we\n> didn\u2019t know at the time.\u201d\n\nPut another way, the book gives us a view of science before discovery. It is a\npractitioner\u2019s view of the subject. It is the opposite of a textbook.\n\n*\n\nTrying to study the immune system has gotten me into a Bret Victor sort of\nmood, wondering what could be done, or built, to make understanding this\nsubject easier. A few things come to mind:\n\nThere are some incredible YouTube explainers. Ninja Nerd Science\u2019s videos on\nthe immune system were a miracle\u2014all delivered by a kid in grad school. He is\na genius. What he does so well is what Goodsell, in that Machinery of Life\nbook, does so well, what those famous \u201cInner Life of a Cell\u201d 3D animations do\nso well: he helps you \u201csee the unseeable.\u201d\n\nNinja Nerd Lectures YouTube channel\n\nBut I wonder whether it should be easier for regular people to create useful\nillustrations. Consider how easy it is to write, tooling-wise: on the web, you\nare only ever one click away from a Markdown-enabled textarea that allows you\nto create and publish pretty, hyperlinked documents. Anyone with a keyboard\ncan contribute a few sentences to Wikipedia or answer a question on Stack\nExchange. Drawing, by contrast, is hard, and animating is at least an order of\nmagnitude harder. And yet these media are essential for understanding\nbiological processes.\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nIt\u2019s telling that when I was recently on a Zoom with a PhD student who was\nexplaining RNA-seq, he pulled out his iPad Pro and essentially made a Khan\nAcademy lecture as he talked, drawing along the way. These tools need to\nbecome more common and cheaper.\n\nBut we also need more software like pattern brushes in Adobe Illustrator,\nBioRender, and CellPAINT to make it un-tedious to draw complex objects. We\nneed more software like Molecular Maya, but simplified even further, \u00e0 la\nVictor\u2019s Stop Drawing Dead Fish, to make animating accessible to anyone who\ncan gesture.\n\nQuickly draw an endothelial lining with pattern brushes in Adobe\nIllustratorMolecular Maya\u2019s double-stranded DNA kit\n\nUsing vector graphics and Undo history, it should be possible to make\ncollaboratively editable images, i.e., images that can be slowly improved as\npart of a knowledge project like Wikipedia or Stack Exchange.\n\nI want to be able to take a screenshot of the whiteboard in a Ninja Nerd\nlecture\u2014a big beautiful diagram of the players in the adaptive immune\nsystem\u2014and lasso sections of it, linking to sub-diagrams, some filled in by\nme, some by others, illustrating each of the parts in turn. We should have\nbig, collaboratively edited zoomable \u201cmaps\u201d\u2014hierarchical diagrams\u2014that are\neasy to navigate, work in standard browsers, are embeddable in blog posts, and\nso on.\n\nOf course we need to teach more people how to draw. It\u2019s an underrated skill.\nAnd how to write vividly, as in the wonderful books above.\n\nBut biology is uniquely suited to simulation\u2014it\u2019s a world of machines that are\ntoo small to see. The trouble is, it requires too much specialized skill to\ncreate three-dimensional interactive simulations. We need a toolkit that\u2019s\nlike MockMechanics, or Minecraft, that maybe even is Minecraft, but focused on\nbiology. Or something much better.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Watson and Crick depended for their discovery on a\nliteral physical model that was machined for them specially. Victor\u2019s\nDynamicland imagines an immersive collaborative space in which such models can\nbe built\u2014now that we have computers\u2014as quickly as you can have a conversation.\n\nThis is exactly what I wanted as I was writing my immune system article. I\nwanted to conjure models I could play with in my hand. I wanted a museum where\nI could walk around inside the epithelium during an immune response. I wanted\nto put ideas into physical space, like on a pinboard\u2014TLRs go here, with the\nother innate armament; CD4+ T cells are there, in the adaptive world\u2014but I\nwanted it to be as searchable, copy-pasteable, shareable, and composable as\ntext.\n\nBret Victor\u2019s vision of dynamic tools for thinking\n\nI think we also need inspiration. There is a romance in biology, as in any\nother science, that a movie like Good Will Hunting could bring out. We need\nheroes. Whoever delivers us from this pandemic in the form of a slam dunk\nvaccine, or a cheap quick reliable test, should become a household name, not\nfor their own glory but for our kids\u2014a Feynman for them to dream about someday\nbecoming.\n\n## Reading list\n\n  * The Machinery of Life, David Goodsell\n  * Bionanotechnology: Lessons from Nature, David Goodsell\n  * A Computer Scientist\u2019s Guide to Cell Biology, William W.
