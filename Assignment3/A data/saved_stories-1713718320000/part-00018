Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Nintendo emulators on the App Store are a far cry from the heady days of\nMiyamoto at an iPhone launch\n\nNews\n\nBy Daryl Baxter\n\npublished 20 hours ago\n\nHave Apple and Nintendo finally pressed \u2018submit\u2019 to the pent-up demand?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWay back in 2016 at the iPhone 7 event, Tim Cook brought Nintendo game\ndesigner Shigeru Miyamoto out on the stage, and the audience lost their minds\n\u2014 myself included.\n\nBack then, it had long been rumored that the Japanese game company was looking\nat bringing its main mascot Mario to smartphones. Some even wondered if the\neffort was going to be a port of an existing game.\n\nInstead, it was Super Mario Run, a runner game that required the player to tap\non an iPhone\u2019s touch screen so Mario could hit blocks, jump on enemies, and\nmore. Since debuting on September 8 that same year, and in 2017 for Android\ndevices, the game has been downloaded over 300 million times. Other games\nwould be released soon after, such as Fire Emblem Heroes, a role-playing game,\nand Mario Kart Tour, a spinoff of Nintendo\u2019s popular racing series that\nfeatures many of the company\u2019s iconic characters.\n\nSince then, however, Nintendo has eased off on releasing new mobile games,\ninstead focusing on other aspects. Its Nintendo World theme park debuted at\nUniversal Studios in 2022 for instance, and its Super Mario Bros Movie has\ngrossed over $500 million since its release in 2023. Another movie adaptation\nbased on The Legend of Zelda series is now in the works.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM imore\n\nWith Apple\u2019s rule change on April 5, retro gaming emulators can now be made\navailable to download on the App Store. Thanks to Delta, a multi-system\nemulator released on April 17, users can now technically play games from\nNintendo\u2019s past consoles and handheld systems.\n\nThis has essentially opened up the floodgates, and, one could argue, that\nNintendo and Apple have both missed out on a huge opportunity.\n\n## Times have changed\n\nNintendo and Apple have always been similar to me. Both aim to create products\nand services that can delight and wonder, whilst thinking of its customers\nfirst. Both have also kept their plans close to their chest, revealing the\nlatest games and products when they\u2019ve felt ready to \u2014 not at the behest of\nshareholders or for the simple need to make money.\n\n## Master your iPhone in minutes\n\niMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with\ndecades of Apple device experience to lean on.

Fans wait\nwith bated breath for its Nintendo Direct \u2014 online events that usually last\nfor up to an hour, revealing its latest games and updates to existing\nservices. Apple has had similar events too, announcing keynotes and products\nwith no prior warning.\n\nYet they also share another aspect as of late \u2014 dropping the ball on\nemulation, which allows apps to behave like one or more gaming systems.\nNintendo isn\u2019t new to this, with its Virtual Console service, having allowed\nWii players to purchase and play games from its past, being emulated versions.\n\nAlmost 18 months after the Switch console arrived in 2017, users have been\nable to play a bunch of NES games from its Switch Online service, which offers\na monthly or annual subscription fee that, in 2024 lets players access\nhundreds of emulated retro games on the Nintendo Switch from Super Nintendo,\nSEGA Genesis, and Nintendo Game Boy, but it hasn\u2019t been a smooth ride.\n\n## Times are-a-changin'\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWhen Nintendo 64 games first launched on the service in October 2021, the\nemulation performance was not good. Slowdown, wrong textures, and filtering\nproblems were just some of the issues. Similar problems had plagued the other\nsystems before, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as the N64 games. It took the company a\nyear for the games to be in a state where they looked as good as the original\ncartridge versions.\n\nNintendo, like Apple, is a company that always wants to move forward, to look\nahead and see how it can surprise players time and again. Both have a rich\nhistory, yet both refuse to acknowledge it. Or if they do, like Nintendo\u2019s\nOnline service, it feels half-hearted.\n\nThe same applied when Miyamoto took to the stage in 2016 at the iPhone 7\nevent. Many were hopeful that we\u2019d soon receive ports of existing Nintendo\ngames. I remember thinking that, if the company brought out a service on the\niPhone, featuring a bunch of its past games, which would only work with a\ncontroller, I\u2019d be sold.\n\nInstead, we got pay-to-play service games from Nintendo, and Apple\nconsistently refused to allow emulators and different storefronts to be made\navailable on the App Store. Thanks to the DMA ruling by the EU in March\nthough, times are changing.\n\nEmulators that were once thought to be impossible to download on the App Store\nare now here, like Delta. Others, such as Provenance, another multi-system\nemulator, confirmed to iMore that it\u2019s coming to the iPhone as well. Users can\nnow, at risk of breaching copyright law, play Super Mario 64 and many more of\nthe plumber\u2019s entries through Delta \u2014 and for free. Millions carry around an\niPhone in their pocket, much like a Game Boy from back in the day, and they\ncan now use this app, free of charge.\n\nNow though, Nintendo and Apple have lost. From what originated as a\npartnership in 2016, both have now seemingly given in and let third-party\ndevelopers do what they want with gaming emulators on the App Store. Yet the\none winner here is the user, despite both companies dropping the emulation\nball so badly \u2014 in a strange way \u2014 it\u2019s worked out for the best.\n\n### More from iMore\n\n  * How to play games on Delta for iPhone\n  * Exclusive: iPhone emulator Provenance following Delta onto the App Store, with SEGA and PlayStation support in tow\n  * Delta iPhone emulator also works on Mac and Apple Vision Pro\n\nDaryl Baxter\n\nFeatures Editor\n\nDaryl is iMore's Features Editor, overseeing long-form and in-depth articles\nand op-eds.
