It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nThe latest monthly update of the TIOBE index asks, \u201cIs PHP losing its mojo?\u201d\nFor the month of April, TIOBE\u2019s programming language index ranked PHP 17th,\n\u201cits lowest position ever.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just TIOBE that shows PHP declining in popularity. In the annual\nStack Overflow developer survey, PHP has fallen from 30.7% in 2018 (i.e. the\npercentage of respondents that use PHP) to 18.58% in 2023. The JetBrains\ndeveloper ecosystem survey shows a similar drop-off, from 30% in 2017 to 18%\nin 2023. This is particularly notable, since JetBrains (along with WordPress\ncustodian company, Automattic) is among the biggest sponsors of PHP, as I\u2019ll\nget into shortly.\n\nZoom\n\nJetBrains dev survey.\n\nThe drop-off is perhaps most starkly illustrated in BuiltWith, where the PHP\npopularity growth line started going down towards the end of 2020.\n\nZoom\n\nBuiltWith graph for PHP.\n\nThe last time I wrote about PHP, in November 2021, the red line (polling the\ntop 1 million websites) was still above 30,000. Now, two and a quarter years\nlater, it is closer to the 15,000 mark \u2014 although the actual figure BuiltWith\nquotes, as I write this, is 18.19%. That 18% mark aligns better with the Stack\nOverflow and JetBrains surveys, so we can confidently say that PHP has dropped\nfrom about 30% popularity among developers to 18% now. That\u2019s a 40% decrease\nin just over two years.\n\nSo what gives? What has changed so much in the past couple of years to make\nPHP an also-ran in web programming languages?\n\n## WordPress Now \u2018JavaScript-First\u2019\n\nArguably the biggest reason for PHP\u2019s decline is that WordPress, by far the\nweb\u2019s most popular content management system, is moving away from PHP and into\nJavaScript. Matt Mullenweg, the co-creator of WordPress and CEO of Automattic,\nsaid as much at WordCamp Asia 2024, held last month in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\n\u201cI believe the majority of new code in WordPress is Javascript now, and has\nbeen for some time,\u201d he said, in response to an audience question. \u201cSo in many\nways, you could argue, by what\u2019s the majority of activity happening, that\nGutenberg has made us sort of a JavaScript-first project.\u201d\n\nYes, you read that correctly: Matt Mullenweg said that WordPress is now a\n\u201cJavaScript-first project.\u201d Gutenberg, the company\u2019s controversial new block-\nbased user interface, is the main reason for that. He admitted, though, that\nthe shift from PHP to JavaScript \u201cwas not easy.\u201d\n\nZoom\n\nWordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Asia 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that WordPress isn\u2019t still heavily reliant on PHP. I would\nknow, since I am typing this post into WordPress at a URL ending \u201c/wp-\nadmin/post-new.php.\u201d But it\u2019s clearly no longer the future at WordPress.\n\nMullenweg also talked about further improvements he\u2019d like to see in WordPress\n\u2014 and it was striking that he views at least some of this through a JavaScript\nlens now. For instance, PHP is a server-side scripting language (meaning the\ncode is usually processed on a web server), but Mullenweg would like WordPress\nto do more on the client-side using JavaScript.\n\n\u201cGosh, I feel like we should be doing so much more processing on the client\nside,\u201d he mused, \u201cand maybe even pushing some of that [processing to the\nclient] if I\u2019m editing something. Maybe that\u2019s faster to do in the browser, in\nthe JavaScript, which now has incredible virtual machines and really fast\nprocessors, than it is trying to do that on the server side.\u201d\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

In particular, the developer who asked this question\nwanted to \u201creduce the level of abstraction\u201d in Gutenberg.\n\n\u201cI think the development, honestly, is something that you\u2019ve got to learn,\u201d\nMullenweg replied. \u201cAnd I think that the way that Gutenberg does development\nand the JavaScript-first [approach] is kind of the future of most web\ndevelopment. It is unfamiliar for me as well, by the way \u2014 it\u2019s not what I\nlearned originally. And there are probably some abstractions that we could\nsimplify, but by and large, I would dive into it.\u201d\n\nHe added that Gutenberg \u2014 and presumably, the shift to JavaScript \u2014 is not yet\ncomplete. \u201cWhen we started Gutenberg, we said it was going to be a 10-year\nproject,\u201d he said, \u201cand so it feels like we\u2019re 60 to 70% of the way there.\u201d\n\n## Meanwhile, at the PHP Foundation...\n\nSo the WordPress project, the largest reason why PHP is still prevalent across\nthe web, is moving towards the JavaScript world. That is almost certainly\ndiscouraging younger developers from adopting PHP, and forcing other\ndevelopers \u2014 such as those devoted to WordPress customers \u2014 to move away from\nPHP and into JavaScript.\n\nHowever, there is still a relatively large group of developers using PHP \u2014 18%\nof two large developer surveys isn\u2019t nothing. And that\u2019s where the PHP\nFoundation comes in.\n\nI was prompted to write about PHP back in November 2021 because a new non-\nprofit foundation had been formed that month to assume caretaker duties of\nPHP. The PHP Foundation was created by a coalition of companies led by\nJetBrains and including Automattic, Zend, Laravel, Acquia (custodians of\nDrupal), and others. Roman Pronskiy, an engineer from JetBrains, assumed\nresponsibility for the project \u2014 he\u2019s currently listed as \u201coperations manager\u201d\non the foundation website.\n\nAt a Laravel conference in February, Pronskiy mostly focused on technical\nmatters, but he did admit that \u201caddressing PHP\u2019s public image\u201d is \u201cthe hardest\ntask for the PHP Foundation.\u201d While he didn\u2019t specify what\u2019s caused that\npublic image to drop, I refer you back to Matt Mullenweg\u2019s comments about why\nWordPress is now \u201cJavaScript-first.\u201d In any case, Pronskiy quickly pivoted to\nthe active development going on now in the PHP project, including by ten paid\ndevelopers.\n\nZoom\n\nPHP Foundation team.\n\nIn conclusion, it is easy to see PHP in 2024 as the forgotten child of web\ndevelopment, while JavaScript is the most popular kid in class. Sadly for PHP,\nits decline in usage is unlikely to stop any time soon \u2014 why would it, when\nWordPress developers are busy adapting to a new JavaScript paradigm? But at\nleast there is active development at the PHP Foundation.\n\nRichard MacManus is a Senior Editor at The New Stack and writes about web and\napplication development trends.
