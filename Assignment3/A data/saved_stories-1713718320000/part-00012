The host was familiar with\nmy work, citing a recent CNBC appearance, and seemed ready to hold an engaging\nconversation. It seemed worthwhile, except the podcast was fake.\n\nWith a bit of research \u2014 using podcast search engine Listennotes.com \u2014 I found\nno evidence the host had ever spoken on a podcast, let alone hosted one. On\nYouTube, he had a channel with one video, and one subscriber. And when I asked\nfor a link to his show, he uninvited me. I was probably lucky.\n\nFake podcast invites, I\u2019ve since learned, are a new ploy that scammers are\nusing to take over your online accounts. The process typically goes like this:\nSomeone invites you to appear on a show, asks you to join a \u201ctech check,\u201d and\nthen takes your credentials during the setup. Instead of a media appearance,\nyou\u2019re left with a nightmare of account recovery.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nuts. I haven\u2019t heard of that one,\u201d Alex Stamos, chief trust officer\nat SentinelOne, told me via email. \u201cPodcasts? Is nothing sacred?\u201d\n\nBy preying on people\u2019s vanity, or their thirst for exposure, fake podcast\ninvite scams are becoming increasingly more common. After I shared my story on\nX, a surprising number or people replied with notes saying they \u2014 or people\nthey knew \u2014 had been targeted by the scam. One influencer, Gabi Tuft, even\nissued a press release about it last month, saying she\u2019d been asked to join\nTravis and Jason Kelce\u2019s New Heights Podcast, only to have her credentials\nstolen by a fake producer.\n\n\u201cAfter scheduling Tuft\u2019s appearance, the scammer requested to do a pre-\ninterview meeting that was presented as an opportunity to make sure everything\nwould run smoothly,\u201d the release said. \u201cDuring this meeting, he had Tuft\nchange Facebook settings, which allowed him to clandestinely infiltrate her\naccounts. Hours after this meeting, Tuft was locked out.\u201d\n\nOn X, I heard from Matt Hardigree, publisher of The Autopian, whose colleague\nwas invited to a podcast with no online presence at all. \u201cI spent about five\nminutes researching it and decided it wasn't even worth having this person\nknow we had functional email addresses,\u201d he said. The podcast had a similar\npitch, offering a chance to share \u201cthe journey as a 7-figure entrepreneur.\u201d\n\nJesse Angelo, former CEO of the New York Post, said he had a \u201cstunningly\nsimilar\u201d experience. \u201cGuy invited me on his podcast, I could find zero\nevidence of the existence of the podcast (despite him saying it was gigantic\nand important), and he got all weird when I started asking questions about\nit.\u201d\n\nAnd after my first encounter with a fake podcast, a second one pitched me.\nSomeone posing as a producer from Barron's asked me to join one of their\nshows. The person was based in \u201cBritain,\u201d but sent the message in the middle\nof the night U.K. time. It was a clear fake, likely trying the same scam.\nBarron\u2019s did not respond a request for comment.\n\nAs podcast prestige \u2014 and listenership \u2014 has increased, the prevalence of\npodcast scams has grown as well. That includes fake podcast sets used to hawk\nproducts, and mobile game sites that juice download counts via in-game perks.\nPreying on potential podcast guests to steal their online credentials is just\nthe latest in the genre.\n\nOnce I heard from various targets of fake podcast invite scams, I decided to\ngo back to my original host. \u201cSorry for asking,\u201d I wrote. \u201cBut are you doing\none of those fake podcasts where you take people's credentials during the tech\nsetup?\u201d\n\nShortly afterward, he blocked me.\n\nShare\n\n##\n\nWhat Else I\u2019m Reading, Etc.\n\nSundar Pichai to Google employees: Don\u2019t use the company as a political\nplatform [The Keyword]\n\nAmazon says its Amazon Go stores are mostly automated, contrary to reports\n[Geekwire]\n\nIt\u2019s not MKBHD\u2019s fault that the Humane Pin sucks [Techcrunch]\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s VASA-1 creates animated, talking faces from still photos [Tom\u2019s\nGuide]\n\nGoogle merges Android, Chrome and hardware [Ars Technica]\n\nAI\u2019s risks do not mean the end of the world [Science]\n\nNew Yorkers can\u2019t stop the honking [New York Times]\n\nMeta\u2019s head of generative AI talks about how the company built Llama 3 [Big\nTechnology]\n\n##\n\nAdvertise with Big Technology?\n\nReach 165,000+ plugged-in tech readers with your company\u2019s latest campaign,\nproduct, or thought leadership.
