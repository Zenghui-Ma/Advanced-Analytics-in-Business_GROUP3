Tokens are the codes used for website ownership verification in\nSearch Console, Merchant Center, and other Google products. We have seen cases\nwhere these were accidentally left behind after owners have moved on. In\nFebruary 2023, we rolled out improvements to the user and permissions\nmanagement report. The latest changes will improve the accuracy and reflect\nthe actual state of unused ownership tokens.\n\nYou will now be able to verify whether an unused ownership token has been\nremoved from the site by following this flow:\n\n  1. Visit the Users and permissions interface\n  2. Click \"Unused ownership tokens\"\n  3. Choose the tokens you'd like to remove and click \"Remove\" (see screenshot below)\n  4. Click \"Verify removal\" to get update for the unused ownership token\n\nAs a reminder, a best practice for managing user permissions in Search\nConsole: When removing a previous verified owner, be sure to remove all\nverification tokens for that user. The update rolled out today lets you verify\nthe removal of the unused verification token so that removed owners cannot\nregain access to the property.\n\nAs always, we love to hear feedback from you. You can use the feedback form\nwithin Search Console or the help forums to ask questions or submit feedback.\n\nPosted by Nir Kalush, Product Manager and Mohamad Sarsour, software engineer\non the Search Console team\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under\nthe Apache 2.0 License.
