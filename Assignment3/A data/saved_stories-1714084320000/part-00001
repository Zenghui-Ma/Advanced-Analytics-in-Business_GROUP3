They are home to many of the fish we eat and support\nvast numbers of birds, while the surrounding salt marsh helps to stabilise\nshorelines and absorb floods.\n\nHowever, a new study shows that nearly half of the world\u2019s estuaries have been\naltered by humans, and 20% of this estuary loss has occurred in the past 35\nyears.\n\nUsing satellite data, researchers measured the changes that had occurred at\n2,396 estuaries between 1984 and 2019. The results, published in the journal\nEarth\u2019s Future, found that over the past 35 years more than 100,000 hectares\n(250,000 acres) of estuary have been converted into urban or agricultural\nland, with the majority of the loss (90%) having occurred in rapidly\ndeveloping Asian countries.\n\nBy contrast, very little estuary loss has occurred in high-income countries\nduring the past 35 years \u2013 mostly because extensive estuary alteration\nhappened many decades before, during those countries\u2019 own phase of rapid\ndevelopment.\n\nMany high-income countries are now recognising and undoing the damage, with\nlocations such as the Tees estuary in northern England investing in returning\nthe area to mudflats and salt marsh to help reduce flood risk, increase\nresilience to the climate crisis, replenish fish populations, and let nature\nrecover.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Coastlines\n  * Terrawatch\n  * Wildlife\n  * Oceans\n  * Biodiversity\n  * Conservation\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Terrawatch: Santorini watchful as nearby volcano is monitored\n\n25 Jan 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Terrawatch: Earth\u2019s \u2018boring\u2019 plate tectonics period\n\n3 Nov 2021\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Terrawatch: Tibetan plateau shifting and stretching over time\n\n5 Nov 2014\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Everest's ice is retreating as climate change grips the Himalayas\n\n25 Sept 2011\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Nepal and India begin relief efforts as monsoon floods claim at least 180 lives\n\n18 Aug 2014\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Scientists warn against China's plan to flatten over 700 mountains\n\n4 Jun 2014\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Big cats' oldest ancestor found in Tibet\n\n13 Nov 2013\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
