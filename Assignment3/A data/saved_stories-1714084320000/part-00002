But the\napparent precision of these simple calculations ignores the messy reality of\nplanetary bodies. Tidal forces, combined with the roiling currents in Earth\u2019s\ncore and the redistribution of ice sheets at its surface, cause the planet\u2019s\nrate of spin to vary ever so slightly from year to year.\n\nThis irritant was scotched in 1967 with the definition of a new second,\nderived from the vibrations of caesium atoms inside uber-precise atomic\nclocks. The two seconds, solar and atomic, are almost exactly equivalent. But\nnot quite. The leap year 1972, for example, should have had 31,622,400\nseconds. Reckoned by atomic seconds, however, Earth\u2019s full journey around the\nsun took 31,622,401.14. As a result, two additional seconds were added: the\nvery first \u201cleap seconds\u201d. One, on June 30th that year, made up for the lag;\nthe second anticipated an impending additional one. It was added to the very\nlast minute of the year\u2019s very last day.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Start your free trial\n\n### Explore all our independent journalism for free for one month.
