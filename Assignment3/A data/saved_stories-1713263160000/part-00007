Based on a\nsociety-centered approach, Society 5.0 seeks to take advantage of\ntechnological advances to finally solve the problems that currently threaten\nJapan, such as aging, birth rates and lack of competitiveness, among others.\nAdditionally, another objective is to contribute to the progress of the\ncountry and develop the foundations for a better world, in which no individual\ncan be excluded from the technological advances of our current society, to\nachieve this goal, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have been\ndeveloped. SDGs seek to assess the methods of use of modern technology and\nthus find the best strategies and tools to use it in a way that guarantees\nsustainability within the framework of a new society that demands constant\nrenovations.\n\nKeywords:\n\nsociety; sustainability; big data; artificial intelligence; cloud computing\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIn January 2016, the Japanese Government disseminated information on the Fifth\nBasic Plan for Science and Technology (2016\u20132020). The initiative is called\n\u201cSociety 5.0\u201d, and it seeks to create a sustainable society and contributes to\nthe safety and comfort of individuals based on a specific cyberphysical system\n[1,2]. Society 5.0 defines a system of systems. In it, several systems (such\nas energy management and highway transportation systems, among others) are\nconnected on the Internet for the mitigation of both local and global social\nproblems (such as the reduction of carbon emissions).\n\nThe concept of Society 5.0 aims at solving social issues from a new\nperspective. In this new era, different aspects would be connected and\ntechnologies would join a superintelligent society with full integration from\nbig data, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and\npeople services to facilitate digital and physical infrastructures for human\nbeings. The objective hereof is the establishment of societal foundations\nwhere anyone can develop value, at any time and place, in a safe environment\nand according to natural environments, without any limitations such as those\nthat currently exist [3].\n\nSociety 5.0 defines a system of systems (such as energy management and road\ntransport systems, among others) that connect to the Internet for the\nmitigation of both local and global social problems (such as the reduction of\ncarbon emissions). This new concept of society aims to focus on the human to\nbalance the deployment of Big Data Technologies, the Internet of Things, and\nArtificial Intelligence with the resolution of major problems of society such\nas: competitiveness, productivity, connection and wellbeing All these on the\nbasis of achieving the maximization of human use of the ongoing technological\ntransformation, digitization.\n\nThe paper mentions key points of Society 5.0, beginning with the description\nof the four revolutions of society and industry focused on the change\ngenerated at different levels of society and industrialization to achieve the\nobjectives proposed by Society 5.0. In addition, the political perspective\nthat involves governments and citizens is addressed, considering the\nimportance of sustainability to achieve a better quality of life. Through the\nuse of cyberspace and physical spaces with the implementation of IoT, big\ndata, and AI, an infrastructure is proposed to carry out Society 5.0.\n\nThe proposed infrastructure addresses the concept of Society 5.0 from\ndifferent points of view, establishing the origin of the concept and its\ndevelopment in practice and measuring the scope and social consequences of its\napplication in a global context. In this way, managers and politicians are\nprovided with an overview of the literature and the problems found in\npractice.\n\n#### 1.1. Overview\n\nThe article presents Society 5.0 through five phases, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe first one describes, in the second section, the beginnings of the concept\nof Society 5.0 through a chronology of time. Next, the third section\ncorresponds to the implementation phase that describes the perspectives in\nSociety 5.0 concerning social aspects, such as energy consumption and health\ncare. In the fourth section, the implementation and impact phase shows Society\n5.0 in different areas and also presents a relationship between Society 5.0\nand sustainable innovation. The next phase, described in the fifth section,\nintroduces the concept of Agenda 2030 and establishes its relationship with\neconomy in Society 5.0. In the end, an objective approach is given in the\nConclusions.\n\nFigure 1. Article structure.\n\n#### 1.2. Methodology\n\nReview articles can be classified in various categories according to the\nmethodology used, its purpose, and its structure. In [4] there is a list with\nthe main categories, pointing out the methodological aspects of each one:\nsearch, analysis, and synthesis. These are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Review categories and their methods.\n\nRegarding this paper\u2019s structure and approach, it should be noted that it\nconstitutes a state-of-the art review, as shown in Table 1. It also addresses\nthe issue, contrasting the approaches of the different sources and proposing\nhow these can guide future research on the subject. The section \u201cAgenda 2030\u201d\naddresses this topic from the sections \u201cPerspectives\u201d and \u201cImplementation and\nImpact\u201d, and both constitute the document core as it is explained in the\nprevious section and outlined in Figure 1. Regarding the synthesis methods,\nthe document is structured by thematic points or sources, as needed [5].\n\n## 2\\. Chronology\n\nThis section sets the context for its research on Society 5.0 and the\nindustrial revolution. Therefore, the paragraphs provide an overview of the\ndifferent industrial revolutions and types of societies that predated each\nrevolution and how they have led the way to the current status. Society 5.0\nand the Fourth Industrial Revolution have carried forward several features\nfrom their predecessors, either by developing them or increasing additional\naspects. The five industrial revolutions are described below.\n\n#### 2.1. The Industrial Revolutions\n\nSocial evolution has been marked by the attainment of freedom thanks to\nmastering diverse technologies, abilities, and techniques. These technological\nand structural advances, as well as the main development leaps made by\nsociety, are classified in industrial revolutions.\n\nStarting with the invention of the steam engine up to the implementation of\nAI, industrial revolutions have set the advances of humanity as a society. To\nclearly understand the concept of Society 5.0, a description of the industrial\nrevolutions that took place before the Fourth Industrial Revolution is\nwarranted [6].\n\n#### 2.1.1. The First Industrial Revolution\n\nFrom 1780 to 1820, the First Industrial Revolution was one of the most\nsignificant social, economic, and technological transformations in human\nhistory. In this revolution, humanity underwent changes in its rural economic\nsystem from an agricultural production to a manufacturing and industrial\nproduction system. Three significant factors were influential, i.e.,\ninventions of machines; energy generation options, such as using steam for\nindustrialized transportation; and forms of labor organization, such as\nfactory workers. These innovative processes created an exponential growth of\nsociety and led to an understanding of the world in a different way with a\nfocus on production and development techniques. Since that moment, society\nchanged from surviving to developing and progressing.\n\n#### 2.1.2. The Second Industrial Revolution\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution occurred as part of the first period of\nglobalization, from 1870 to 1914. It was boosted by novel energy options, such\nas electricity and oil-generated sources, automatic machinery that\nmanufactured parts of other machines, the development of land transportation\nand airplane flights, and the onset of cinema and communication systems. All\nof this brought about accelerated industrial and economic changes in society,\ncreating novel organizational growth models.\n\nBased on these new models, serialized processes substantially decreased\nproduction time and costs. This led to an increased internationalization of\nthe economy and made a big impact on society. The use of electricity\naccelerated communication and transportation processes but increased\nunemployment due to the replacement of employees by machinery.\n\n#### 2.1.3. The Third Industrial Revolution\n\nThe Third Industrial Revolution occurred in 1970. Its leaders were the United\nStates, Japan, and the European Union. It is associated with the new term\n\u201cInformation Society\u201d. Its main feature was industry automation based on how\nnew communication and energy technologies coalesced and complemented each\nother. The use of the microchip and of integrated electronic components, which\nreplaced existing storage and communication methods, was the foundation for\nthis new information society.\n\nThe Third Industrial Revolution has highlighted the importance of developing\nintelligent R&D&I policies. Such technological progress created by new\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT), such as the Internet,\ndeveloped a novel societal paradigm, for which a different perception of\ninformation was required. This produced the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\n#### 2.1.4. The Fourth Industrial Revolution\n\nIn the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a wide range of new technologies for\nfactories, was established based on sensors and information systems, whose\ngoal was the adaptation and the development of personalized client services.\nIts goal was to design and develop subsequent transitions and adaptations of\nnew information systems based on modern digital revolution infrastructures in\na shorter time.\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is based on several productive axes\nconsidering big data, robotics, IoT, cloud computing, and augmented reality,\ninter alia, for complete manufacturing automation. In this way, emerging\ntechnologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution directly impacted society by\ngenerating new ways to move and communicate, creating value, and distributing\nopportunities.\n\nThe historical description of several industrial revolutions denotes how, in\nthe first three industrial revolutions, the process went from mechanization\nand the steam engine to assembly line production, power, automation, and\nvehicles. Industry 4.0 was marked by the velocity of disruptive changes of\ncyberphysical systems, smart industry, automatic knowledge, deep knowledge,\nbig data, and IoT [7,8]. In a direct manner, the development of the different\nindustrial revolutions is related to the concept of Society 5.0 [9]. In this\nchronological period in the history of humankind, future technological\nadvances are restated and led by an approach whose goal is the well-being of\nall individuals [10,11].\n\nChanges in society are defined by cultural level, economy, politics, and\ncommunication. Societies are determined by context and depend on the\ndevelopment of each region; on the other hand, industrial revolutions are\nmainly framed in technological and industrial changes, which characterize the\ntype of revolution that the country or region is facing.\n\nDuring the transition from one society to another, changes occur at all social\nlevels; for this reason, societal change is generally subsequent to industrial\nrevolutions, as is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. The relationship between innovations based on science, technologies,\nand changes in society.\n\nThe figure above illustrates how industrial revolutions overlap and indicates\nthe main technological advances that cause society change.\n\nAfter the four previous societies, Society 5.0 arises, which is focused on the\nunderstanding of this new reality and its social approach. Within this\ncontext, a tour of the diverse types of society that preceded Society 5.0 is\nalso required.\n\nThese periods of industrialization not only had a great economic impact, but\nthey also generated enormous social transformations due to the substitution of\na class society based on feudalism by a class society determined by material\ngoods. The different stages of industrialization reinforced global\nurbanization, and as a consequence of industrialization, the entrepreneurship\nsector obtained great wealth by selling their products and paying low prices\nfor labor power. In this way, each of the industrial revolutions represented a\nsubstantial impact in the categorization of the five societies contemplated by\nthe concept of Society 5.0.\n\n#### 2.1.5. Society 1.0: The Hunting and Gathering Society\n\nThe first society was led by nomads, who were in charge of food gathering and\nhunting. They constructed provisional shelters and did not live a full year at\nthe same location. Nomads roamed in specific territories already known to them\nwhere they could live, and their only goal was to find food. This complicated\ntheir survival difficulty because they relied on finding available food\nsources.\n\nThis was a society with a nonproductive economy. They spent time hunting and\ngathering pieces of fruit, vegetables, and roots, among others. However, they\nwere quite skilled in adapting to territories, as they stayed in groups to\ncommunicate and to help each other by sharing knowledge. Fire was important in\nthis society because it provided protection, as it kept animals away from\nhumans. Additionally, fire was also used as a heating, lighting, and cooking\nsource. Furthermore, people manufactured hunting weapons and other tools from\nstones or bones. In this period, tasks were divided, which would mean that\nwomen gathered food and men hunted.\n\n#### 2.1.6. Society 2.0: The Farming Society\n\nIn this society, agriculture was discovered and developed. Hence, society was\nable to reach a new level of evolution. Crops and land production allowed for\nthe formation of tribes from a larger number of previously nomadic family\ngroups. They could now live in permanent locations near rivers where they\ncould fish and places where they planted and harvested food. Humankind became\nsedentary because crops or livestock could not be transported. For this\nreason, society members had to build robust huts where they could now live and\nharvest crops all year round.\n\nThus, they became self-sufficient based on what they could plant, raise, or\nmake with their own hands. The economy exploited several resources offered by\nthe land, such as fruit, vegetables, and grains. They also began to spend time\nweaving and making ceramics. Eventually, they started exchanging products, a\nprocess known as bartering, between settlers. Currency did not exist, so they\nstarted to exchange any product that was available for bartering. Mostly,\nprecious stones were exchanged, and most people made necklaces out of them.\n\n#### 2.1.7. Society 3.0: Industrial Society\n\nThis society corresponds to production massification, i.e., the advent of\nfactories and machines that replaced manual labor. Additionally, the\ntechnological innovations of the time also fostered mass production, thus\nachieving reductions in costs and time and increasing the resources acquired\nto a great extent, which, in turn, increased worker salaries and income. As a\nresult, people now started earning money that did not even exist before. The\nfirst industry was the textile industry, which was largely based on the use of\ncoal.\n\nThis evolution significantly changed how people started to think. Social class\nstructures also started to emerge because economic differences were defined by\nthe material goods each person and family possessed. Additionally, in this\nperiod, people also started gaining rights.\n\nRegarding the evolution of economics, merchandise production centered on the\nresearch of mechanisms for manufacturing products with the least possible\nhuman effort and involvement while employing advanced technology. The most\nevident benefits were transportation since the development of railways and\nsteamships allowed people to travel to other places more quickly.\n\n#### 2.1.8. Society 4.0: Information Society\n\nIn this age, technologies simplified the use of information. This is more\nnoticeable in social, cultural, and economic activities because they are\ncentered on people and on interconnecting technological innovations that allow\ninformation to flow quickly and accurately all over the world.\n\nThe revolution of this society includes information access and interaction\namong individuals using ICTs, thanks to the preparation and distribution of\ninformation. Things and people are connected to any place in the world. For\nexample, the Google search engine can easily be used to reply to our\nquestions, which fosters access to knowledge. Additionally, social media keeps\npeople informed on world events, news, or events that are happening in that\nprecise moment.\n\nIn fact, the technological features of the information society have been\nstrengthened by governments due to the positive effects produced on the\neconomy. Currently, to succeed in the work market, one must possess skills\nrelated to the use of information. Currently, organizations automate\nindustrial processes to use resources more efficiently, as in digital\nmarketing, and thanks to these innovative methods, new clients are being\nacquired without requiring substantial investments.\n\n## 3\\. Society 5.0: Perspectives\n\nThis is a society focused on human beings, who, through economic progress, are\nable to solve social issues with systems developed through the integration of\ncyberspace and physical spaces [12]. This novel societal model focuses on the\nconnection of the real world with the cyberworld, which was defined and\nevolved in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, to more effectively and\nefficiently solve current societal issues [3].\n\nBased on a unified system, this new social model manages economic and social\nissues and directly focuses on the interests and demands of people [13]. From\nan organizational point of view, Society 5.0 seeks to create new methods for\noperating individualistic systems where companies, universities, and\ngovernments independently strive to create a collaborative operational concept\nboosted by current societal interconnectivity [14,15].\n\nA sustainable society is involved in and attends to its present without\ncompromising the opportunities of the future, thus organizing itself to\nimprove the quality of life and autonomy of the citizens that comprise it and\nto aspire to the common welfare.\n\nSustainability is a holistic approach that considers various areas, and\nsociety is an important base among them, as seen on Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Three bases of sustainability [14].\n\nThe concept of Society 5.0 has been developed mainly in Japan, defining an\nideal situation toward which each country should evolve to fully leverage\ncontinuous technological transformations, thus benefiting all their citizens\n[16].\n\nIn 2015, this concept emerged as part of the framework of the V Science and\nTechnology Basic Plan (2016\u20132021). In fact, it was promoted by cabinet members\nof Shinzo Abe, the then-current Prime Minister, who, at the CeBIT Hannover\nfair in 2017, displayed this model to the world [2].\n\nThe alignment of Society 5.0 actions and objectives with the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations Development Program is\ndefined as \u201ca universal call for the ending of poverty [17], the protection of\nthe planet, and to guarantee the enjoyment of peace and prosperity by all\npeople by 2030\u201d [18] (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4. Sustainable development goals.\n\nThe SDGs were planned in order to achieve collective progress between\ngovernments and citizens, thus avoiding the consequences of social inequality\n[17].\n\nSince then, many countries have oriented their investment and research\nstrategies towards a similar model [19,20,21], in which sustainable\ndevelopment is idealized from its initial planning, considering the advances\nin infrastructure and technology, thus achieving an improvement in\nindustrialization and the environment [14].\n\nThe Japanese government defines the following actions to be implemented and\ncarried out within Society 5.0 to achieve execution towards the objectives of\nthe SDGs in the year 2030.\n\nCities and Regions. In Society 5.0, social processes and data must be\ndistributed in manners that would allow for developing smarter solutions,\ndesigning living methods, and establishing a society where diversity is valued\n[22].\n\nEnergy. When local and decentralized power microgrids are developed, Society\n5.0 will supply clean sustainable power to everyone [22].\n\nDisaster Mitigation and Prevention. For disaster mitigation, new digital\ntechnologies will be used. Medical services will be continued even during\nemergencies [22].\n\nHealth Care. In preventive phases, novel health care technological\ndevelopments will be available for everyone. Based on their own initiative,\nindividuals may use and manage data associated with their health [22].\n\nAgriculture and Food. Cutting-edge technologies will be applied to the\ngreatest extent to optimize food value chains. The involvement of several\nactors will be sought, such as private-sector corporations, youth, and\nagricultural companies [22].\n\nBig data, data science, and AI are essential R&D technologies that have to be\naccurately integrated to achieve Society 5.0 objectives [9]. These objectives\nare focused on the advanced merging of cyber and physical spaces. Therefore,\ninformation will be collected from several sensor types located in physical\nspaces and compiled through the IoT [23]. The transition from Society 4.0 to\nSociety 5.0 is illustrated in the following figure.\n\nFurthermore, novel technologies, such as cloud computing, IoT, and big data\nwill require a newly updated infrastructure, as defined below.\n\n## 4\\. Society 5.0: Implementation and Impact\n\n#### 4.1. IT Infrastructures\n\nThis new model of society is established in IT infrastructures [24], which\ninclude networks, cloud computing, data centers and big data incorporated into\nthe renewed municipal infrastructures with intelligent processes of energy,\nwater, and transport networks [21,25].\n\nInfrastructure integration within Society 5.0 revolves around high-speed\nbroadband connections and ubiquitous mobility; urban readiness also promotes\nintensive construction processes for various types of IT infrastructure [26]\nto create a relationship between users, IoT, big data, AI, and personalized\nservices [7].\n\nSensor Networks. The information collected from several sensors is sent to\ncentral processing units, wherein it is integrated and stored in data\nmanagement platforms at an intermediate level. At this level, unstructured\ndata are stored for subsequent analysis at the top level. For these purposes,\nthe Shiojiri-Japan City Council invested in developing a network of diverse\nIoT sensors distributed throughout the whole region for the automatic\ncompilation of environmental data, as can be seen on Figure 5. This network is\nalso used to exchange data from other organizations interested in benefiting\nthe local population.\n\nFigure 5. Diagram for the Shiojiri Environmental Data Compilation Platform and\nits sensor Internet of Things network.\n\nIoT (Internet of Things). As part of IoT, everything connected to the Internet\nfeatures enhanced technologies that identify accurate data from the physical\nworld, facilitate the compilation of appropriate data in real time, and send\nthese data to cyberspace [27].\n\nBig Data. The name refers to a large amount of data, which cannot be\ntraditionally analyzed because it is composed of structured and unstructured\ndata. With the IoT, Society 5.0 has created a need for implementing additional\nstorage techniques due to new data volumes attained [28]. Big data is the set\nof techniques that can be used to compile and process large quantities of data\nand conduct their immediate analysis through data science. This generates\nadditional value related to the information society [29].\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence). On data included and managed through IoT and big\ndata, several analysis techniques are applied for monitoring and acquiring\ninformation. In this light, AI is also used to facilitate decision-making\nprocesses for managing a large number of resources and, consequently,\nguaranteeing safety in urban areas [30].\n\nIn 1960, AI capabilities were initially proposed, and they have been\nresearched since that year. In fact, these capacities have rapidly and\nrecently improved because of the invention of deep learning. AI has the\nability to analyze complex recognition patterns, predict behavior, and\naccurately execute operations of physical systems. Its goals are to make\ndecisions and solve overly complex problems, provided it is correctly designed\nand executed.\n\nEven when AI automates many human tasks, it is not considered a problem for\nthe new society, since the output generated by robotics and AI must, at all\ntimes, be under human direction.\n\nIndividual-Oriented Services. Individual-oriented services are evidenced in\nseveral areas, such as energy, food, health care, local regional\ninfrastructure, climate change, and disaster prevention/reduction [19].\n\nNevertheless, the superintelligent society does not establish its operations\nin individual sectors, as it traverses many fields and has impacts on\ndifferent behaviors, cultures, and societal patterns, among others.\n\n#### 4.2. Health\n\nJapan is an aging society and, in 2065, individuals aged 65 and over will\naccount for 38.4% of its total population. This will generate a substantial\nreduction in the workforce while increasing the costs of health care and\nsocial security. According to the National Federation of Medical Insurance\nCompanies, Japan\u2019s health care expenses will increase from JPY 41.3 trillion\nin 2016 to 57.8 trillion in 2025. This translates to an aging society with an\nexcessively high cost of living.\n\nPopulation aging is a critical issue discussed at a global scale. For the\nfirst time in history, aging is drastically growing, since the population over\n65 years of age will be increasing drastically in subsequent years over the\npopulation of children aged under 5, which denotes a steep decrease in birth\nrates. By 2050, the population of senior citizens will triple and will\ncontinue to increase, as seen in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Population projections for the year 2050.\n\nThis issue occurs not only in Japanese society. In fact, several other\ncountries already report an increasing percentage of their aging population\nthroughout 2050. This might mean that an older population would impair the\nbusiness sector, affecting employment rates as opposed to several other\ncountries where the working-age population is larger.\n\nIn digital health care, Society 5.0 presents an alternative perspective,\nwherein technology provides support and improves health care medical systems\nto guarantee a good quality of life. Through the implementation of technology,\ndata insights may be used to forecast and prevent diseases based on immediate\nand remote health care services [31].\n\nCountries such as India and the United States have decided to store medical\ndata in the cloud to better monitor their population\u2019s current health status.\nThey collect information on patients using a data registration process, and\neach patient\u2019s medical history is saved and stored in the cloud, thus securing\nbetter health care for each person. For example, people suffering from\nhypertension will now wear a blood pressure bracelet. With this tool, the\ncurrent medical status of each patient can be determined, and patient data\nwill be immediately sent to their doctor [19].\n\n#### 4.3. Education\n\nIn recent years, education has been influenced by new Society 5.0\ntechnologies, prompting critical structural changes. Classroom face-to-face\nteaching is no longer essential or necessary. Modern Society 5.0 technologies\nhave fostered digital teaching with videoconferencing and virtual reality\ntools, thus reaching more students simultaneously without physical classroom\nconstraints.\n\nA comprehensive educational system at different levels is needed, and\nprofessionals are required to develop and acquire skills related to data\nmanagement and processing. For these purposes, the educational Society 5.0\nsystem promotes the design of training processes that facilitate the\ndevelopment of competencies not only for work but also for the consumption of\nculture, adaptation to continuously changing environments, ownership of basic\nconcepts, and interaction with our environment and with others, along with\nsocial and personal development.\n\nUniversities must recognize their social function not only as trainers but\nalso as creators of new knowledge [32]. When using this new educational model,\ninitiatives must also be implemented to allow connections among diverse\necosystems for the attainment of the greater added value of products and\nservices. Partnerships established with industry, academia, and the government\nwill have a more significant impact on the knowledge generated, as well as\ntheir sense of ownership in accordance with the requirements and problems of\nthe production sector and society in general. There will also be greater\nmobility of researchers between organizations, industries, and disciplines.\nHence, based on the novel educational model proposed by Society 5.0,\ncollaboration between universities and business must be encouraged to generate\nknowledge because, as seen in the following chart, there is still a large\nproduction gap between both sectors in Latin America compared to the United\nStates or Europe.\n\nIn Germany, the IoT is applied to convert education to digital formats,\nexhibiting a substantial change when applying the IoT in several educational\ninstitutions for fostering distance learning and attaining a technological\nvision of privacy [7].\n\n#### 4.4. Manufacturing\n\nIn China, Industry 4.0 established the foundation for a manufacturing\nstrategic plan called \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d. This concept promotes\ntechnological advances with a global focus [33], wherein Chinese products may\nmeet the innovation objectives at a national and international level by\nestablishing higher priorities for new technologies [34].\n\nAdditionally, Japan has rerouted its efforts with an increased holistic vision\nof technology [35]. The three objectives proposed by the country of Japan,\nalong with the industrial objectives of creating enhanced social benefits\ncoupled with digital and physical spheres for better social well-being, are as\nfollows:\n\n  * To provide essential products and services, in sufficient quantities, as required by people whenever they require them.\n\n  * To respond to diverse social obligations aimed at providing enhanced quality services to all humanity.\n\n  * To generate environments for an active and enjoyable life.\n\nThe manufacturing sphere of Society 5.0 generates an environment wherein there\nis movement among industries and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),\nwhich account for 90% of all companies at a global level, to create a\nsustainable world with an improved quality of life and social well-being. The\nrole SMEs play in the market is to generate diversity and innovation as\nrequired by the population.\n\n#### 4.5. Sustainable Innovation\n\nDuring the development process of Society 5.0, sustainable innovation is\nconsidered a fundamental concept.\n\nSustainable innovation is understood as a process where sustainable\nenvironmental, social, and financial considerations are integrated into\norganizational systems.\n\nSuch integration is generated from ideas to R&D and the subsequent\ncommercialization of results.\n\nThose results are products, services, technologies, and new business and\norganizational models.\n\nSustainability is a key concept for the innovation processes presented by\nSociety 5.0 due to its deep relevance in economic, social, and environmental\ndimensions. In the economic context, sustainability is related to profit, with\nproblems of economic growth, the efficient use of resources, and the financial\nviability of commercial enterprises. In the environmental context, it focuses\non the fight against pollution and the efficiency and appropriate use of\nnatural resources. In a social context, sustainability refers to issues such\nas equality of opportunities, justice in the distribution of wealth, ethical\nbehavior, equity, and impartiality. In this way, it seeks to achieve a more\ncompetitive economy, which generates sustainable economic growth with more and\nbetter jobs and social cohesion, leading to sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n#### 4.6. Digital Transformation\n\nThe model proposed by Society 5.0 has a number of changes that offer\nopportunities to create new systems and processes. Those are technological,\neconomic, geopolitical, and mental changes.\n\nDigital transformation will drastically alter many aspects of society,\nincluding private life, public administration, industrial structure, and\nemployment, through the use of cyber spaces and their integration into\nphysical spaces.\n\nPhysical spaces and cyberspace integration is achieved by means of the fact\nthat the large amount of information (big data) produced by sensors in\nphysical spaces is accumulated in cyberspace. Big data is then analyzed\nthrough artificial intelligence tools (AI), and in the end, the results are\npresented to users in different ways in physical spaces through audiovisual\ndevices, such as screens or speakers.\n\n#### 4.7. Model Disadvantages\n\nIn the new model of Society 5.0, digitization will be in many innovation\nprocesses in which sustainability is present at various levels. However, to\nimplement this model, some disadvantages must be considered:\n\n(1)\n\n    \n\nSociety 5.0 implementation, at a global level, is the technological leap from\n4G to 5G. This process is complex and requires significant improvements to\navoid computer scientist attacks [36].\n\n(2)\n\n    \n\nThe digital evolution proposed in Society 5.0 is closely linked with IoT\ntechnologies; in this way, there is an exponential increase in the volume of\nimportant data of companies and human beings that can be affected by hackers\n[33].\n\n(3)\n\n    \n\nCobot implementation in industrial processes leads to a decrease in the number\nof workers and an increase in the salary of specialized staff [37].\n\n(4)\n\n    \n\nTechnology must be changed and hardware becomes obsolete, generating\nenvironmental pollution over the time [38].\n\nTherefore, it should be noted that in Japan, these disadvantages were\nprevented, and despite of the difficulties that this may bring, the\nimplementation of the model is worth it. Most of the evaluated aspects of\nSociety 5.0 are intended to take full advantage of the technological\ntransformations and thus improve living conditions and achieve sustainable\ndevelopment.\n\n## 5\\. Economy and Agenda 2030\n\nAs of 1968, the Japanese economy has undergone changes in its internal\nstructure, positioning Japan as the first industrialized Asian power.\nNevertheless, in the past decade, due to several socioeconomic problems, the\nJapanese economy has been growing at a rate lower than 1%, since the 1990s,\nwith a debt representing 230% of the country\u2019s national GDP.\n\nDue to the aging of society, in 50 years, Japan will lose one third of its\npopulation. Based on the development the Society 5.0 social model, Japan is\ntaking control measures over the population in response to these socioeconomic\nissues.\n\nSeveral Japanese ministries have adjusted their control policies under Society\n5.0 [39]. For example, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry developed\nthe concept of connected industries, defined as \u201cachievements, challenges and\nthe next steps in terms of using the IoT in manufacturing processes in the\ncountry\u201d [3].\n\nThis concept is boosting a new direction for manufacturing with a Society\n5.0-focused approach, specifically with the contribution of new values\ngenerated by diverse connections.\n\nThese associations are: things with other things, people with machines,\norganizations with organizations, people with other people, the dissemination\nof knowledge and development, suppliers with clients, large organizations with\nSMEs, different field and industries with digital technologies, and different\nways of collaboration.\n\nMany focuses are redirected thanks to implementing the superintelligent\nsociety. Keidanren (the Japan Business Federation) published a paper, in 2016,\nwith instructions on how to address the challenges listed for breaking five\nwalls [40]. They are listed below.\n\nThe Wall of Ministries and Agencies (Public Administration). The\nrepresentation of national tactics is required along with the inclusion of a\ngovernment support system.\n\nTechnologies involved in Society 5.0, which will shape the next smart\nsocieties, will allow for a connection between citizens and key decision\nmakers; this will increase the participation of other actors and, finally,\nwill have an effect on decisions related to sustainability [41].\n\nThe Wall of the Legal System. Laws must be passed for the implementation of\nadvanced techniques. In practice, this would require regulatory reforms and\nthe development of a digital government that can take advantage of the\ncommunication technologies involved in Society 5.0 and allow for the closer\nparticipation of citizens in the proposal and approval of laws that involve\nsustainable practices [41].\n\nThe Wall of Technologies. The document described common commitments with\nfundamental roles for all technologies or areas to secure and implement them,\nfrom cybersecurity to nanotechnology, robotics, and biological and systems\ntechnology [42].\n\nThe impact analysis of Industry 4.0 on a local context was done on [43]\naccording the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in some developing\ncountries, and it was found, by comparison, that the impact is greater in\ndeveloped countries, in part caused by competitiveness dynamics involving\ntechnological advances [44].\n\nThe SDGs are the continuity of the 8 UNDP Millennium Development Goals, which\nwere the result of the 2000 Millennium Summit. The SDGs are a plan that was\ncarried out to meet the present needs without negatively affecting future\ngenerations.\n\nCountries have decided to achieve the 17 goals by 2030; this action plan\nincludes people, the environment, and prosperity.\n\nThe SDGs emerge for the eradication of poverty and to combat climate change.\nThrough sustainable development, the necessary transformations are\naccomplished to create a more inclusive and developed world, connecting the\nenvironment and technology.\n\nThe idea is that each country would be more sustainable through actions of\ngood social policies, decent work, inclusion, and equality; this provides\npolitical coherence to adopt the issues in a more transversal way.\n\nThe Wall of Human Resources. Educational innovations and training in IT, as\nwell as specializations in advanced digital abilities, are essential.\n\nTechnological innovation, as one of the bases of Society 5.0, can leverage key\nfeatures, such as digital convergence, reduction in the costs of communication\nand information, and the growth of international networking, with the implied\nimpact in sustainability [22].\n\nThe Wall of Social Acceptance. This is a wall based on social agreement and an\nexploration of social consequences along with the ethical behavior of Society\n5.0 [45]. Some of the policies adopted by the Society 5.0 involve key sectors,\nsuch as energy, healthcare, and public service, among others, that impact the\npopulation in a broader context and are determined based on social agreement\n[46].\n\nThe 2030 Agenda adopted in 2015 by the United Nations states and members\nconsidered that the most pressing current global challenge is the elimination\nof poverty. Therefore, it proposed 17 objectives with 169 essential goals,\nconsidering that several categories imply economic, social, and environmental\nchanges [47,48]. Japan envisioned that many other countries would face the\nsame problems, which is the reason for promoting the implementation of Society\n5.0 in all countries. They declare that Society 5.0 contributes to\nimplementing the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda. To achieve these development\nobjectives under Society 5.0, each region must refocus its processes based on\nthese new approaches [23].\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nAfter exploring the main aspects of Society 5.0, the importance of the\ndirection under a sustainability approach in global projects beginning with\ntheir planning was established.\n\nBased on technology that merges physical spaces with cyberspace, according to\nthe new Society 5.0 paradigm, leading-edge technologies, such as the IoT, big\ndata, and AI, are related. Therefore, sensor networks are used to compile\nlarge amounts of data and store them optimally through big data. These data\nare processed by AI algorithms for data analysis to extract information and to\ngenerate value from such data. In this way, custom services are created for\nanyone, anywhere, anytime. Evidence of the power and flexibility of Society\n5.0 is demonstrated offering equitable solutions to the needs of each person.\n\nSociety 5.0 is centered on human beings at the core of transformations\ntogether with economic growth, technological development, and sustainability.\nThis novel society model is based on the fact that humanity is accessing the\nfifth social revolution. From the analysis, it was seen that Society 5.0,\nthanks to its approach, allows for the development of sustainable technology\nwithout limiting prosperity.\n\nAdvances of this novel societal concept are highlighted along with their\ninfluence on educational techniques and scenarios [49]; the inclusion of\nvirtual systems and new work models; their impact on health care [50]; changes\nproduced for the future of manufacturing, including SMEs, to develop a\nsustainable world; and the financial and research investments made by several\ncountries.\n\nThis document offers a contribution to understand the concept, structure, and\nimpact of the implementation of Society 5.0 with a sustainability approach.\nSociety 5.0 proposes that through sustainable digital innovation, the\nchallenges of modern society are faced to increase the potential of the\nindividual\u2013technology relationship in order to promote the improvement of\npeople\u2019s quality of life through a superintelligent society\u2014Society 5.0.\n\nFeatures are discussed seeking to meet the custom needs of individuals, taking\ninto account the social and ethical obligations of the digital technology\nparadigm. Consequently, it can be concluded that to achieve the objectives of\nthis super society, humanity is redirecting projects to advance towards an era\nof industrial and social advances.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nInvestigation and writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.N.R. and G.A.A.P.;\nconceptualization and methodology, D.F.L.B.; Project administration, C.A.T.R.\nwriting-review & editing, C.A.T.R.; All authors have read and agreed to the\npublished version of the manuscript.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research has been funded by Direcci\u00f3n General de Investigaciones of\nUniversidad Santiago de Cali under call No. 01-2021.\n\n## Institutional Review Board Statement\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Informed Consent Statement\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the\ncorresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest to report regarding\nthe present study.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
