But large swathes of the financial system are stuck in the past. Many\ntransactions still take days to complete and rely on time-consuming clearing,\nmessaging and settlement systems and physical paper trails. Improving the\nfunctioning of the financial system is thus an important public policy\nobjective. But building a financial system fit for the future requires a\nvision for what we want to achieve.\n\n#### Contribution\n\nWe propose the concept of the \"Finternet\" as a vision for the future financial\nsystem: multiple financial ecosystems interconnected with each other \u2013 much\nlike the internet. The Finternet would be designed to empower individuals and\nbusinesses by placing them at the centre of their financial lives. Unified\nledgers are a promising vehicle to turn this vision into reality. Grounded on\na digital-first approach and leveraging tokenisation, unified ledgers would\nimprove existing financial transactions, but also make entirely new financial\nproducts and transactions possible. We describe the economic rationale for the\nFinternet as well as its required technical, regulatory and legal building\nblocks. In addition, we lay out eight fundamental design considerations that\nwe feel should be a core part of the future financial system.\n\n#### Findings\n\nWe identify three necessary components: an efficient economic and financial\narchitecture, the application of cutting-edge digital technology and a robust\nlegal and governance framework. Unified ledgers are a promising vehicle to\ndeliver on all three. In particular, by bringing together multiple financial\nassets in a single venue, they could vastly reduce the need for lengthy\nmessaging and clearing processes, thereby delivering more efficient and\nreliable services for users.\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThis paper lays out a vision for the Finternet: multiple financial ecosystems\ninterconnected with each other, much like the internet, designed to empower\nindividuals and businesses by placing them at the centre of their financial\nlives. It advocates for a user-centric approach that lowers barriers between\nfinancial services and systems, thus promoting access for all. The envisioned\nsystem leverages innovative technologies such as tokenisation and unified\nledgers, underpinned by a robust economic and regulatory framework, to\ndramatically expand the range and quality of financial services. This\nintegration aims to foster greater participation, offer more personalised\nservices and improve speed and reliability, all while reducing costs for end\nusers. Most of the technology needed to achieve this vision exists and is fast\nimproving, driven by efforts around the world. This paper provides a blueprint\nfor how key technical characteristics like interoperability, verifiability,\nprogrammability, immutability, finality, evolvability, modularity,\nscalability, security and privacy can be incorporated, and how varied\ngovernance norms can be embedded. Delivering this vision requires proactive\ncollaboration between public authorities and private sector institutions. The\npaper serves as a call for action for these entities to establish a strong\nfoundation. This would pave the way for a user-centric, unified and universal\nfinancial ecosystem brought into the digital era that is inclusive,\ninnovative, participatory, accessible and affordable, and leaves no one\nbehind.\n\nJEL classification: E42, F33, G21, G23\n\nKeywords: payment systems, financial system, financial intermediaries,\nfinancial instruments, currency, digital innovation, unified ledgers,\ntokenisation\n\nAbout the authors\n\nAgust\u00edn Carstens\n\nMore from this author\n\nNandan Nilekani\n\nMore from this author\n\nTop\n\n  * Share this page\n\nStay connected\n\n  * Follow us\n\n  * Sign up to receive email alerts\n\n  * About BIS\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * FAQ\n  * Contact\n  * Careers\n  * Translations\n\n  * Legal information\n\n  * Terms and conditions\n  * Copyright and permissions\n  * Privacy notice\n  * Cookies notice\n  * Email scam warning\n\n", "frontpage": false}
