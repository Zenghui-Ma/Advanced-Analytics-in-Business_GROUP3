But it\u2019s less about a tech upgrade and\nmore about a \u2018scam\u2019\n\nBy Rounak Kumar Gunjan\n\nThe contactless, biometric entry system wants its users to believe that a\nweek-long outage and a sudden app launch are because of its expansion plans.\nBut that\u2019s hardly the case\n\n16 Apr 2024 / 11 min read\n\nRounak writes on financial services at The Ken.\n\n\u201cThe old app is discontinued. Please download the new app.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Ayub Khan, a staff member tasked with assisting users of\nDigiyatra\u2014a contactless, biometric entry system that allows passengers to\ncheck-in at airports in India\u2014has had to repeatedly tell folks travelling from\nNew Delhi over the last fortnight.\n\nWhile some quietly obey, others seek an explanation, which spirals into\nuncomfortable conversations.\n\n\u201cPassengers argue with us on a daily basis,\u201d said a Digiyatra buddy stationed\nat Hyderabad airport. They and several others didn\u2019t want to be named because\nthey didn\u2019t want to publicly comment on the matter.\n\nPassengers aren\u2019t irked without a reason. None of the Digiyatra users The Ken\nspoke with were aware that the app was discontinued. They found out about the\nchange only when they reached the airport.\n\n\u201cThere was no prior notice. No notifications, no SMSes...\u201d said one of the\npassengers.\n\nDigiyatra is managed by the Digi Yatra Foundation (DYF), a not-for-profit\ncompany. The Airports Authority of India, a state-owned body responsible for\ncivil-aviation infrastructure, holds a 26% stake in the company. The rest is\nheld by five private airports\u2014Cochin, Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.\n\nThe two-year-old DYF chalks this up to expansion plans. \u201cThe Digiyatra app is\npreparing for the future, which includes scaling up to a larger user base. To\naccommodate this growth, we needed to undertake certain changes at the\nbackend, including changes to the application architecture and domain,\u201d the\nfoundation said in a written statement to The Ken.\n\nBut it kept the launch of the new app hush-hush.\n\nThe Ken spoke with a former DYF official and an Airports Authority of India\n(AAI) one, two technologists attached to law enforcement agencies, two app\ndevelopers who\u2019ve worked on government projects, and three private and public\ncivil aviation executives.\n\nAll of them said that the new app is DYF\u2019s attempt to wash its hands off\nDataevolve\u2014a Hyderabad-based cloud-services company. The seven-year-old firm\nbuilt Digiyatra\u2019s tech and it is allegedly involved in a scam scam Newstap AP\ne-challan scam: ED registers case against Former DGP's son-in-law Read more\nscam Newstap AP e-challan scam: ED registers case against Former DGP's son-in-\nlaw in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nDigiyatra has been battling data-privacy concerns since its inception.\n\nIts facial recognition tech lets air travellers skip the check carried out by\nCentral Industrial Security Force personnel who are tasked with verifying IDs\nand flight tickets, before entering an airport. To enable this, the app\ncollects personally identifiable data along with sensitive facial data.\n\nThe app shot to prominence with 3.3 million downloads within its first 15\nmonths as it helped shave time off from tedious boarding processes. But it\nhasn\u2019t been able to break out of the data-security risks associated with its\nuse.\n\n#### Credits\n\nWritten by Rounak Kumar Gunjan\n\nEdited by raveena singh\n\nLede illustration by Kavipriya OG\n\nShare this article with your network\n\nSend the article link to friends or colleagues who might find this story\ninteresting or insightful.\n\nhttps://the-ken.com/story/you-need-to-download-digiyatra-again-but-its-less-\nabout-a-tech-upgrade-and-more-about-a-scam/\n\nSend the article link to friends or colleagues who might find this story\ninteresting or insightful.\n\nhttps://the-ken.com/story/you-need-to-download-digiyatra-again-but-its-less-\nabout-a-tech-upgrade-and-more-about-a-scam/\n\n#### Topics\n\nAirlines airport Airports authority of India data privacy Data Security\nDigiyatra Digiyatra foundation Niti Aayog\n\nEnter your email address to read this story.\n\nSign up for free\n\n# The only business subscription you need\n\nUnrivaled analysis and powerful stories about businesses from award-winning\njournalists.
