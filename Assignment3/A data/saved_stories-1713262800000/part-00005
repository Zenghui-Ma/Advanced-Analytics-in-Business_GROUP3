And that\u2019s strange; it\u2019s exactly the kind of\nculture war red meat that people loved to click on. The problem is that the\npeople who would do the culture warring, the \u201cheterodox,\u201d the \u201cdissidents,\u201d\nthe \u201cIntellectual Dark Web,\u201d they sat this one out. Because the one orthodoxy\nthey\u2019ll never break is the one that says you don\u2019t side with the enemy. Which\nis, of course, the only orthodoxy that\u2019s really worth breaking.\n\nLast February, before the current conflict, The Guardian reported that a\nLondon hospital had taken down a controversial art display, made up of the\npainted plates you see above. You may think that there doesn\u2019t appear to be\nanything remotely confrontational about those plates, but you can\u2019t tell why\nthey\u2019re so wicked by looking at them; they become offensive only when you know\nthat they were painted by Palestinian children, children from Gaza. And some\npatients at the hospital read the little plaque and learned that they were\nmade by children from Gaza and felt marginalized and othered enough to throw\ntheir weight around and get the artwork taken down. Look again. Do you see the\nPalestinian flag? I guess you can sort of see a little piece of one in the\nupper lefthand side, but then again the central image of that plate is a\nliteral olive branch, a plea for peace. Do you see \u201cFree Palestine\u201d anywhere?\nDo you see anything remotely inflammatory? No. You do see women in hijab and\ndupattas, Muslim-ass people doing Muslim-ass things. But that\u2019s it. The plates\nwere just decorative objects painted by children half a world away.\n\nAnd yet the mere existence of these utterly anodyne plates decorated by\nchildren compelled a pro-Israel organization to force the hospital to take\nthem down, because they supposedly made Jewish patients feel \u201cvulnerable,\nharassed and victimized.\u201d Have you ever heard anything that better fits with\nthe anti-woke worldview than that scenario, other than the fact that the\naction broke against Palestinians? That\u2019s a Ben Shapiro wet dream,\n\u201cvulnerable, harassed and victimized\u201d by plates, only too bad it\u2019s the wogs\nwho painted them. It\u2019s like a parody of liberal snowflake culture, this\nscenario. If this exact thing happened but with the ethnic valence reversed,\nso that Palestinians got Israeli children\u2019s artwork taken down by a hospital\n(which they could never achieve), Joe Rogan would have Jamie pulling that\nthing up to mock it every day for a month. r/stupidpol would crowdfund to send\na correspondent to investigate. Helen Lewis would write a snide story for The\nAtlantic about it. Jon Chait would sweat into his keyboard for hours as he\nfulminated about it. Six million TERF Substacks would find a way to turn this\ninto a complaint about how some people with penises wear dresses. John\nMcWhorter would be inspired to write a column wondering aloud what Thomas\nSowell would make of today\u2019s world. (Thomas Sowell is still alive.) Brett\nWeinstein would say that the controversy was proof that fluoride makes you\ngay. The Free Press would start a four-part podcast series about it, hosted by\na horse girl. The entire apparatus of anti-wokedom would kick into high gear.\n\nWhere was Bill Maher after this happened??? It\u2019s right in his wheelhouse.\n\n> Maher: \u201cUh, new rule! Adults need to stop being afraid of dishware, mmmkay?\u201d\n>\n> [audience pretends to laugh]\n>\n> Maher: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this much fake emotional pain in a hospital since I\n> forced my girlfriend to get an abortion!\u201d\n>\n> [Maher laughs and slaps knee]\n>\n> Rickie Gervais on the panel: It\u2019s mental!\n>\n> [Gervais laughs so hard about his own non-joke that he ejaculates in his\n> pants, then dies of a stroke]\n\n\u201cA plate made me feel vulnerable, harassed and victimized\u201d is everything these\npeople say they\u2019re against. For the smarter and more principled ones, this is\nexactly the culture of performative vulnerability you\u2019re always complaining\nabout, a result of the death of resilience as a communal value that (I agree)\nhas hurt a lot of young people. For the ones who just like to point and laugh\nat anyone who says they\u2019re in pain, even better. This has everything you\u2019d\nlook for - except that the identified vulnerable population was not Black\npeople, or Muslims, or trans people, or the disabled. The identified\nvulnerable population was Zionist Jews, though I doubt any significant number\nof such people felt vulnerable at all. (This has all the hallmarks of one\nhyper-motivated individual with influence getting what they want.) And since\nthat was the case, since this switched the game up, since Palestinian kids\nwere the aggressors - you know, by painting plates - and since the left loves\nPalestinians, the most basic concepts that underlie these people\u2019s self-\nprofessed values just evaporated. They had nothing to say.\n\nWho in the world could be a bigger snowflake than someone who feels harassed\nby an inanimate object? Ah, but \u201cno friends to my left\u201d is the real catechism\nhere. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all it is. For the vast majority of the supposedly\nheterodox or dissident space, the only game in town is to mock lefties.\nBecause that\u2019s what gets them attention.\n\nI have spent so much time fantasizing about what would have happened if\nIsraeli kids made artwork that was taken down after Palestinian complaints.\n\n> [Jordan Peterson stands in the hallway of the hospital in a suit he made\n> with fabric stolen from a production of Joseph & the Amazing Technicolor\n> Dreamcoat]\n>\n> \u201cYou\u2019ll take down these plates over my dead body, woke moralists! Also where\n> is this hospital\u2019s pharmacy, just curious...\u201d\n\nIf a Black student group on a college campus said that plates painted by white\nchildren made them feel victimized, I would say that they were misguided and\nsuffering under a culture that prizes being vulnerable more than it prizes\nbeing tough. I would say that they can\u2019t go their whole lives behaving that\nway, because the world\u2019s just too hard for that level of sensitivity. I would\nsay that we need to reestablish the virtues of resilience in our cultural\neducation. I would say please, guys, focus on the very real injustices that\nyou labor under. And I\u2019m saying now to whichever delicate Jewish people can\u2019t\nstand to walk down a hospital hallway because there\u2019s art by Palestinian\nchildren on the wall... you\u2019re embarrassing yourselves. Maybe I\u2019m full of\nshit, always a decent possibility. But I have a set of principles here and I\nstick to them. Can the anti-woke say the same? Well, we already know the\nanswer - they didn\u2019t say shit when it actually happened.\n\nIf you can\u2019t acknowledge that any other identity group that felt vulnerable,\nharassed, and victimized by some plates on a wall would be ruthlessly mocked\nby the \u201cheterodox,\u201d then you\u2019re a propagandist. And if you can\u2019t understand\nwhat that says about the vast and growing anti-politics that\u2019s speedrunning\nthe transition from being anti-establishment to becoming the establishment,\nthen you\u2019re an idiot. This is how a new witless consensus grows and replaces\nthe old witless consensus. And before you know it, these people themselves\nwill be the exact type of unelected gatekeepers of culture they never stop\ncrying about.\n\nI guess this part is necessary and inevitable.\n\nTo the many who would say that I just am part of that world, instead of\nprofessing my values I think I\u2019ll just share what I\u2019ve published. Recently, I\nhave written in support of abortion rights here, I have explained why\nRepublican rule is terrible for the working class here, I have advocated for\nthe Palestinian cause here and here and here, I have written in defense of\ntrans people here and here and here and here, I have made a prototypical\nleftist case against the nation-state here, I have lamented the\nmarginalization of Medicare for All here, I have memorialized our disastrous\nwar in Iraq here, I have articulated why rising government investment in\nhealthcare is humane and necessary here, I have critiqued AOC from the left\nhere, I have made the progressive case for an American policy of open\nimmigration for all Jews here, I have laid out the socialist and\nenvironmentalist case for a housing abundance movement here, I have attacked\n\u201clearn to code\u201d and the idea of the impractical humanities major here, I have\ncriticized effective altruism from the left here, I have explained why\ncapitalism is a fickle game of chance here, I have laid out the poverty of\nequal opportunity as a goal from a left perspective here, I have showed why\npeople can\u2019t just will their way out of obesity here, I have expressed my deep\nmoral revulsion towards our ongoing use of the death penalty here, and I have\ndefined labor organizing as core to the left\u2019s project here. All of it from\n2023 or 2024. Indeed, because of my productivity I have published more purely\nleft-wing words in the past two years then many writers who never write\nanything that isn\u2019t straightforwardly liberal.\n\nEverything listed above is indisputably left wing, but of course I think that\nall manner of things I write about are left-wing in substance, just not\naccording to current liberal norms. I left out anything that others would\nrefer to as anti-left for argument\u2019s sake. But it all points towards the left\nin the end, from my particular definition of what the left is and should be. I\noften disagree with the progressive media consensus, which is fine because I\u2019m\nright and they\u2019re wrong. I write about free speech and civil liberties because\nthose are left-wing values no matter what some cossetted 27-year-old Haverford\ngraduate thinks. I wrote for The Boston Globe that identity politics is bad\nfor the left because I sincerely believe that to be true, and I was working in\nthe lineage of Todd Gitlin, Michael Parenti, Adolph Reed, Richard Rorty.... My\nrecent piece about the commodification of queer culture takes as its targets\npeople and institutions who call themselves progressive, but in the service of\ndemonstrating that those people are betraying actual left values themselves.\nMy piece about how easily far-right politics fit in with therapeutic culture\nis a left-wing argument, it\u2019s just not one that some liberals like. I could go\non.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a leftist because you criticize liberals\u201d is the wildest shit\nI\u2019ve ever heard; the natural enemy of the leftist is the liberal. Not because\nconservatives aren\u2019t worse - they are worse - but because dragging liberals\nleft is inevitably more realistic and more valuable than trying to turn\nreactionaries into socialists. Besides, it\u2019s difficult to think of any issues\non which conservatives would benefit from me getting what I want. If Freddie\nwas king, the wokest person you know would get 90% of what they want or more.\nAt the end of the day, my politics stand in favor of the liberation of all\nmankind, and I will keep my own counsel as to what it means to be left-wing. A\nlot of people in media call me a reactionary because they don\u2019t like me\npersonally and they want everyone they don\u2019t like personally to be a\nRepublican. There are writers who will say I\u2019m just anti-left and editors who\nwill let them get away with it because I am unpopular in the industry and an\neasy target. But that\u2019s not my problem, that\u2019s their problem.\n\nFinally, I write stuff that criticizes people on the left because it is\nprecisely the absence of harsh, good-faith criticism within the left that has\nallowed this anti-left tendency to fester and grow. And now here we are.\n\nPeople hate it when I go nutpicking by complaining about specific tweets, but\nI think this is a good little jumping off point. The tweet now stands at some\n3000 likes and was retweeted by Free Black Thought, an organization I respect\nthat\u2019s produced some good critiques of contemporary racial discourse in the\npast. But this tweet makes zero sense; it\u2019s transparently meaningless.\n\n> The only countries obsessing over their \u201cracism\u201d are those not currently\n> enslaving humans.\n\nWell... yes. Yes, it\u2019s true: the countries that eliminated racial chattel\nslavery are those which are most concerned with racism, in much the same way\nthat countries that have eliminated tuberculosis are likely to be the ones\nthat are most fixated on epidemiology. This is dog-bites-man, water-is-wet\nstuff. It\u2019s such a blind stab at being contrarian that it ends up right back\nat the banal truth. This only makes sense as a remotely provocative statement\nif you think that the point of racism discourse is to say that Western\ndeveloped nations are bad and the traditional victims of the racism of those\nnations are good. But that\u2019s a child\u2019s conception of what we\u2019re up to, here;\nyes, some poorly-argued \u201canti-racists\u201d conceive of race that way, but I am\nunder no obligation to join them. (I want to do smart advocacy for racial\nequality, not dumb advocacy for racial equality.) The core point should be\nthat some ideological and economic and political structures that led to the\nnormalization of chattel slavery in the past still exist and contribute to the\nperpetuation of racism today. The problem though is that that isn\u2019t contrarian\nenough, isn\u2019t anti-woke. And this is what I mean when I call this all an anti-\npolitics.\n\n> And those countries which are said to be the main victims of Western\n> \"racism\" are those who are currently the most enthusiastic slavers.\n\nSome of the countries in question are not \u201csaid to be\u201d the main victims of\nWestern racism, they are objectively the main victims of Western raism. What\nis the point here? What does that observation have to do with how we confront\nthe legacy of slavery or the racism of today? Again, fighting racism isn\u2019t\nabout measuring out which countries are the most or least racist, the most or\nleast bad. It\u2019s about understanding what structures exist in our societies\nthat perpetuate both material and social racial inequality, and yes, some of\nthose structures are remnants of our many, many years of forcing Africans into\nchattel slavery.\n\nThis whole thing feels transparently motivated by the guilt-derived-resentment\nthis particular tweeter says he shouldn\u2019t have to feel. Like, what\u2019s the\nendgame here? Would you hop in a time machine and tell a slave being worked to\ndeath on a cotton plantation \u201cHey don\u2019t complain, your country will be an\nenthusiastic \u2018slaver\u2019 two hundred years from now?\u201d What is the moral\nreasoning? If we\u2019re being honest, it\u2019s \u201cI feel personally indicted by\ncriticism of racism, so I\u2019m attacking a strange caricature of modern\nphilosophy on race.\u201d And what\u2019s with the scare quotes around the word racism?\nIs Free Black Thought really aligning itself, now, with people who put the\nvery term racism in scare quotes? The only derivable meaning of putting the\nword racism in scare quotes is to suggest that racism in fact is not real. But\nracism is real and it\u2019s as material as it gets. Is the desire to oppose\ndipshit wokies so great that they\u2019re willing to splash around in the waters of\npure racism denialism? I\u2019m going to step out on a limb and suggest that racism\nexists; racial differences provoke hatred, stereotypes, and inequality and\nhave for centuries. This is empirically and historically true, not disputable.\nI\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s woke.\n\nKmele Foster\u2019s comment, meanwhile, is not factually wrong, but is a non\nsequitur. Yes, slavery is very old, and most human slavery in history has not\nbeen organized on racial lines. But so what? \u201cSlavery is old, therefore it\nshould not be taken seriously today\u201d is not a very compelling line of\nreasoning. Slavery has not always or not even usually been organized around\nracial lines? Again, true but irrelevant. I don\u2019t understand why the existence\nof white (by modern standards) slaves in ancient Rome would somehow change how\nwe view either the evil of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which was uniquely\npernicious, or how that slave trade echoes into the present era. Never before\nor since in the history of the world was slavery practiced at that scale\nacross distances of that magnitude, nor produced an identifiable offspring\npopulation as consistently oppressed as Black Americans. That is what should\nmatter to us. Slavery was wrong. The plight of Black people today is wrong.\nThe rest is sophistry.\n\nIf I had to define the problem here, and in the general instincts of the\n\u201cheterodox,\u201d I would say that there is too much demand for contrarian views\nand not enough stuff worth being contrary about. So you get people cobbling\ntogether provocation like this. As I said the other day, the dissident\nmedia/\u201cintellectual dark web\u201d space has plenty of targets but no purpose.\n\nConsider this piece by Louise Perry.\n\nPerry is the latest to run with the \u201cLGBTQ people who oppose the slaughter of\nPalestinians are a joke because Palestinians are Muslims\u201d faff. This displays\nthe usual broken moral reasoning, as such:\n\n  1. \u201cMuslims\u201d is an incredibly capacious category (a quarter of humanity) which, while it certainly includes a strong tendency towards homophobia, also includes all manner of people who are technical opposed to homosexuality but not particularly animated about it, or are indifferent to gay rights and gay identity, or are actively accepting of LGTQB people\n\n  2. Even if every last Palestinian was actively homophobic, it would not in any sense suggest that gay people cannot or should not support the Palestinian liberation effort, as one thing has nothing to do with the other. A gay person who feels that the Palestinians are in the right, based on the actual issues in that conflict, is certainly under no obligation to ignore that feeling simply because there are people in Palestine who don\u2019t approve of his lifestyle. I don\u2019t understand what people think is supposed to happen here. Someone says \u201cyou know my investigations into the events of 1948 suggest to me that the Palestinians have been badly mistreated and are owed restitution, to say nothing of more recent events - whoops, I\u2019m gay, never mind!\u201d?\n\n  3. Palestinians Muslims are, speaking generally and as a group, secular and moderate, especially compared to some other parts of the Muslim world, especially since late 20th-century extremist groups took power in places like Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nI\u2019m in solidarity with Falun Gong members over their oppression by the Chinese\ngovernment even though Falun Gong really is a cult and I don\u2019t support their\nideology. Similarly, I am in solidarity with Palestinian religious\nconservatives on the subject of the liberation of Palestine itself, which does\nnot at all require that I accept any of their other beliefs that conflict with\nmy values. This stuff is not hard. I must underline the fact that historically\nthe Palestinian liberation struggle has been a profoundly secular one. The\nPLO\u2019s secularism was one of its political strengths and part of what appealed\nto various external powers. Indeed, Israel\u2019s well-documented support for Hamas\nstemmed in part from the Israeli government\u2019s understanding that casting\nPalestinians as violent Muslim extremists plays into their hands.\n\nYes, Gazans voted to elect Hamas - in an election with bad turnout where Hamas\nwas intimidating voters and yet still didn\u2019t win 50% of the votes, an election\nwhich (by the way) took place before almost half of the population of Gaza was\neven born. Fatah was/is, I\u2019m afraid, deeply corrupt, and Gazans had perfectly\nnormal political reasons for supporting the opposition party. Do people even\nunderstand that the vote was 44.5% to 41.4% in favor of Hamas over Fatah? In a\nterribly-designed election system, to boot? Unfortunately, Palestine does not\nhave ideal conditions for a healthy alternative party, given that its people\nare stateless and dispossessed and have had land stolen out from under them\nfor generations and are subject to periodic displays of mass violence on the\npart of the IDF. That is not fertile soil for liberal secularism; it\u2019s fertile\nsoil for extremism. And those liberal and democratic Palestinian leaders\nWestern thinkers are always asking for have a habit of being disappeared by\nIsrael. When people say \u201cWhere is the Palestinian Gandhi?,\u201d you can tell them\nthat he\u2019s probably in an Israeli prison.\n\nAlso, not for nothing, but large portion of Palestinians in both sections of\nthe territories remain opposed to Hamas\u2019s rule of Gaza.\n\nSure - I wish more of the people involved in the liberation of Palestine, in\nPalestine, had progressive views on individual social rights and other issues.\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s relevant when bombs are incinerating children every day.\nThe problem is not that there\u2019s some fundamental and insurmountable conflict\nbetween LGBTQ rights and the Palestinian cause. The problem is that the Louise\nPerrys of the world don\u2019t know anything, have studied nothing, weigh in from a\nplace of total ignorance. Like so many people working in this lane, she\u2019s\nleveraging burgeoning majority antagonism to social justice liberalism without\nfeeling any particular need to learn, read, or develop her own internally-\nconsistent worldview beyond the usual senseless m\u00e9lange of empty provocation\nand opposite-world posturing.\n\nShe\u2019s perfectly typical of the whole Joe Rogan spectrum of politics. I don\u2019t\nparticularly hate Rogan, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true (or helpful) when\nliberals simply call him a right winger. But what is true, even more so than\nwhen I wrote about him a couple of years ago, is that Rogan will take any\nargument seriously but is exposed only to right-wing arguments like 80% of the\ntime and so becomes a right-wing figure in effect if not in intent. Joe Rogan\nthe podcast host is welcoming to left guests but Joe Rogan the booker is not,\nand the upshot is that his show is functionally a right-wing program. And a\nlot of his fans are fine with that because they are in fact wingers.\n\nWhich gets to a question that I want to ask more and more often to these anti-\nprogressives lately: are you sure you aren\u2019t just a Republican?\n\nYou get that the accusation of hypocrisy works exactly as well in the opposite\ndirection, right? You get that, right? Tell me you get that. Please.\n\nHey, let\u2019s check out the front page of dissident, heterodox journal Quillette,\nwhich eschews the partisan binary and stands for free-thinking and\nindependence!\n\nHere\u2019s a piece about how pro-Palestinian activists are evil. Here\u2019s an\nargument against post-colonial views on museums. Here\u2019s a complaint about any\nmodern approaches to gender identity. Here\u2019s a piece about Chinese\nspirituality that is in fact just another tired anti-communist screed. Here\u2019s\na piece about Chinese sci-fi classic The Three-Body Problem that is in fact\nyet another tired anti-communist screed. Here\u2019s a piece about why UK\u2019s Labour\nparty must avoid any impulse to tack to the left. Here\u2019s a piece about why\npuberty blockers are bad. Here\u2019s a piece that\u2019s fundamentally about the fact\nthat men are better at chess than women. Here\u2019s - I swear I\u2019m not joking - an\nanti-woke appreciation of William Shatner.\n\nThey host some pieces that don\u2019t have particular right-wing animus. But every\nargument on Quillette that has obvious binary political valence is a right-\nwing argument. That\u2019s not being a dissident. That\u2019s not being independent.\nThat\u2019s not heterodox. It\u2019s orthodox conservatism! It\u2019s boring, bullshit, Rush\nLimbaugh conservatism. Yes, yes, you had a gay friend once, good for you.\nYou\u2019re just a bunch of boring wingers who never publish any pieces that could\nbe considered remotely left-wing by anyone\u2019s definition. It\u2019s simply a far-\nright publication that tries to brand itself into the lucrative \u201csensible\ncenter\u201d space, which has been obvious for as long as the publication has\nexisted. Its founder, Claire Lehmann, strikes me as a woman who holds\nuncomplicatedly conservative views but who feels uncomfortable about that for\nsocial and self-definition problems. The result is this endless quest to\nrebrand conservatism as some sort of truth-telling third way. If you criticize\nthe left, you will sometimes be right and sometimes be wrong. (And you\u2019ll be\nright more often still if you criticize establishment liberals particularly.)\nIf you do nothing but criticize the left without making even half-assed stabs\nat progressive arguments once in awhile, you\u2019re just conservatives.\n\nIf you read the pro-Palestine activist piece I linked to, you\u2019ll see a really\ncommon dynamic: Israel has an absolutely dominant hold on support from\nAmerican institutions, which is what actually matters, but the writer speaks\nfrom a bunker mentality, like Palestinian activists are someday going to be\nable to lead him off to the gulag. Which is of course at the heart of right\nwing politics - irrational fear.\n\nYou could try to point to some third way, some space scratched out in that\npublication that occupies a genuine alternative to the old left-right binary.\nBut... what does that look like, exactly? What are the parameters of that\nthird way? What are its goals, its values? This is the Nothing Party problem.\nYes, it\u2019s true: in the past two decades liberals achieved hegemonic control\nover certain aspects of our cultural and educational industries, leading to an\nat-times suffocating sense that they were in charge of everything and there\nwas no alternative to soggy Hillary for Prez 2016 politics. And annoyance at\nliberal dominance over the communal narrative is very popular, because most\npeople are not liberals and because the average American liberal really is a\nself-righteous elitist who thinks they\u2019re better than everyone. But \u201cI\u2019m\nannoyed at liberals\u201d is not a politics. It\u2019s not a platform. It\u2019s not a\nmanifesto. It\u2019s empty; it\u2019s nothing.\n\nSad fact: social justice progressives think that if you disagree with them on\nany one thing, you\u2019re their enemy, while new right types think that if you\nagree with them on any one thing, you\u2019re their friend. And in the long run\nthat\u2019s some really brutal math for social justice.\n\nWhat\u2019s an alternative to being anti-woke, other than scratching together\ntuition money to study at Emerson and become a dutiful wokie? (Only $54,400 a\nyear! Don\u2019t you dare try to forgive a penny in student loans!) Well, you know,\nyou could just be a conservative.\n\nDonald Trump has obviously complicated things. I get into debates with people\nI know about what the post-Trump future of the GOP might look like. I think\nthe outcome of the battle ahead for who gains control of the American right is\nnot at all clear. We know what it has been, for some time now: conservative\nChristianity, an incumbent-protecting vision of free market capitalism,\nmilitaristic nationalism, and a general antipathy to reducing hierarchy in the\nsocial order. Fundamentally, it\u2019s an ideological giftbag devoted to the\nalready-comfortable that has caused a tremendous amount of injustice but which\nbenefits from the fact that the already-comfortable have the power. Whatever\nelse is true, though, it is ultimately coherent; this approach to conservatism\nhas proved durable and popular because its various parts interface together\neffectively and present something like a moral-political interface, albeit an\nugly one.\n\nWhat does Joe Rogan Thought amount to? An admirable defense of free speech, an\nattachment to intellectual curiosity, a kind of groovy acceptance of\ndifference that collapses as soon as someone makes some spurious claims to\npersonal safety, bullshit bro mysticism, moving to Texas because you\nmistakenly believe it\u2019s a low-tax state, a belief in ancient aliens, utter\nlies about adverse health reactions to Covid vaccines, a relentless fixation\non the absolutely miniscule portion of the child population receiving medical\nintervention for gender transition, an attachment to the idea that the real\nproblem in society is the power of groups that are largely powerless, a\nstrange reconstruction of traditional gender norms by people who think we\nshould all take ayahuasca to get past our hangups, love for guns, the belief\nthat we should not only be free to smoke weed but that getting high should be\ncompulsory (it\u2019ll mellow people the fuck out and there\u2019ll be no more violence\nman trust me), unjustifiable faith in the efficacy of nootropics, total\ncredulity to flimflam artists who claim to be oppressed by The System, a\nsurprising gentleness that curdles into a taste for violence at the slightest\npush, long lectures about how standup comics are the philosophers of our\nage....\n\nAs an ideology it ain\u2019t much, and it\u2019s internal contradictions threaten to\nblow the whole thing up at any moment. But precisely because liberals have\nbent media and the creative arts in their own image, forever dunking on the\n\u201cmeaningless symbols\u201d net while the other side lays it in on the \u201cactual\nprogress\u201d net, this heterodox thing has flourished. I\u2019ve always been amused\nwhen Democrats say that socialists have it easy, because we don\u2019t have to\nfigure out how to actually govern; socialism is the most over-theorized\ngoverning style in history. (I can recommend some good books to you about what\nsocialists would do in the event that society faced problems that no society\never has or ever will.) But this anti-woke thing, there is no center, and they\nreally have had it easy. All they\u2019ve had to do is to point out the hypocrisies\nand corruption of liberals, which is shooting fish in the barrel. If we\ncontinue going the way we\u2019re going, though, they might actually have to figure\nout what they believe. And I think they\u2019ll find that, for example, you can\u2019t\ntrust some of the people who write essays about the inherent health risks of\n\u201cthe gay lifestyle\u201d that are prefaced by the writer assuring you that they\nlove gay people. A lot of people who have said things like \u201cof course adults\nare free to be trans....\u201d will be revealed in time to think no such thing,\nonce in a position of influence. And then you'll have to choose.\n\nYou know Blaire White, the conservative trans celebrity? I feel bad for Blaire\nWhite. Go look around on \u201cX\u201d for tweets about Blaire White. You have people\nwho call her based but won\u2019t call her \u201cshe\u201d; you have conservatives who will\ncall her \u201cshe\u201d who are immediately reprimanded because that\u2019s \u201ctrans\nideology.\u201d I think someday she\u2019s going to realize that she\u2019s aligned herself\nwith a movement full of people who, if they saw her walking down a dark road,\nwould kill her and throw her body in a ditch and would hoot and holler and\npound a Coors Light to celebrate. You can call that dark. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s\ndefinitely dark.\n\nThe problem with liberals (among other things) is that they can\u2019t let go of\nthe flawed logic that suggests that because conservatives are stupid, anything\nconservatives criticize must be good. This Gizmodo article on the Google\nGemini controversy is as insistent in the overuse of \u201canti-woke\u201d as\nconservatives have been about the overuse of \u201cwoke,\u201d pointing to a deepening\naddiction to left anti-politics. Gizmodo is doing that because that\u2019s what\nfarms clicks right now. This is a big problem. But fundamentally, as misguided\nas they often are, contemporary liberals are defining an affirmative vision of\npolitics. They want things - respect and safety for people from marginalized\ngroups, a generous welfare state, a restrained foreign policy, personal social\nfreedoms regarding sex and gender. Mind you, they aren\u2019t willing to sully\nthemselves by trying to win votes from people who can\u2019t identify all the\ncharacters on Girls, but they want things, coherent things, mostly good\nthings.\n\nMeanwhile, we have a right-wing struggling to define post-Reaganite\nconservatism, hamstrung by the serial incoherence of Donald Trump; few people\nbelieve that Trumpism will survive Trump\u2019s death, given its paucity of\nunderlying principle. But what will emerge from the vacuum? I\u2019m constantly\ntold that my sense that God & Reagan have largely been left behind by the\nmodern right is wrong, that they still are the lodestars of the contemporary\nconservative movement. But where is the energy of the not-left right now,\nreally? National Review? The Wall Street Journal? Come on. The foot soldiers\nof the American right, in the 2020s, are those who are motivated primarily by\nculture war issues, not religion, not economics, not even nationalism in any\nterms other than as a partisan football. They care about whatever Dave Rubin\ntells them to care about The people sketching out whatever liberalism\u2019s\nalternative will be are motivated by exactly that status - by the status of\nbeing other than a liberal. They\u2019ll often even tell you that they aren\u2019t\nconservatives; they just hate liberals. This is not fertile territory for\ngenerative ideological work.\n\nThe squabbles happening now are a battle for whatever gets built in the ashes\nof Trump\u2019s presidency (or presidencies), with the genuinely neo-fascist\nelements achieving considerable energy but still unable to coalesce as a\npotential ruling coalition. This is thanks to their extremity but also thanks\nto the fact that, like a lot of their lefty counterparts, they\u2019ve drenched\ntheir political expression in so many layers of irony that even they don\u2019t\nknow how seriously they take what they\u2019re saying. And then you have this large\nand growing layer of not-right-anti-left types, who run the gamut from usually\nright on specific points to generally harmless to actively malevolent. What\nanimates them is the increasing vulnerability of institutional liberalism,\nvulnerability that grows from the peculiar extremist drift of those politics.\nI know this claim enflames liberals more than almost any other, but the 2010s\npush of radlib politics into a more and more extreme parody of itself, driven\nby the fundamentally competitive nature of social media, opened the door for\nthe weirdo curio of the \u201calt-right\u201d of 2016 to become in time the heaving mass\nof conservative vitality in 2024. Are you, as a liberal, to blame? It\u2019s not a\nmeaningful question. But one does not happen without the other.\n\nWell, look folks, for that group of people who I know exists who are genuinely\nmotivated to build a better world for everyone but who find the galactic self-\nregard of modern liberalism suffocating.... It is not sufficient to not\nreplicate the exact shades of idiocy that you\u2019ve been complaining about in\nlefty elites. You have to do better than Louise Perry, putting together a\ngumbo of anti-woke cliches that coalesce into nothing but a set of soft\ntargets, fish in barrels that the Elon Musks of the world will reward you for\nshooting. So many of these anti-wokies have painted themselves into the corner\nof denying that there\u2019s any such thing as structural oppression of minority\ngroups, which is bad enough. But beyond that, so often their various forms of\nengagement are just so witless, so relentlessly devoid of meaning or insight.\nThat\u2019s because the bar right now is incredibly low. A decade of professionally\nand socially-enforced limp social justice politics, a decade of White\nFragility and mandatory corporate diversity trainings, has created vast demand\nfor content that comes from the opposite direction. That means that, as it\nalways does, demand has mostly provoked very uninspiring supply. The weakness\nof so much social justice argument has provoked a seething backlash of even-\nworse anti-social justice argument, and surely this is one of the greatest\ntricks the devil has ever pulled.\n\nPlease tell Christopher Rufo I said he can eat shit.\n\nPerhaps on your way to once again mocking those silly lefties you might take a\nmoment to wonder how many of the children who made those plates are still\nalive.\n\n### Subscribe to Freddie deBoer\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\ncool but rude\n\n248 Likes\n\n248\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Palestinian Painted Plates & the Nothing Party\n\nfreddiedeboer.substack.com\n\n118\n\nShare\n\n118 Comments\n\nCommenting has been turned off for this post\n\nFeral FinsterMar 27\u00b7edited Mar 27\"\u201cA plate made me feel vulnerable, harassed\nand victimized\u201d is everything these people say they\u2019re against.
