He said the\nonline system operated with \u201cits now customary speed\u201d and granted the order\ndivorcing the Williamses within 21 minutes.\n\nThe solicitors realised their mistake two days later and applied to the high\ncourt to rescind the final divorce order. They described the error as being\nsimply that of someone at Vardags \u201cclicking the wrong button\u201d and argued that\nas the final order was applied for by mistake, it should be set aside.\n\nBut McFarlane rejected the application and said: \u201cThere is a strong public\npolicy interest in respecting the certainty and finality that flows from a\nfinal divorce order and maintaining the status quo that it has established.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was necessary to correct the impression that the online\ndivorce portal would \u201cdeliver a final order of divorce where one was not\nwanted simply by \u2018the click of a wrong button\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cLike many similar online processes, an operator may only get to the final\nscreen where the final click of the mouse is made after travelling through a\nseries of earlier screens,\u201d he said.\n\nVardag, one of the UK\u2019s highest-paid divorce lawyers, said the judge had\nreached a \u201cbad decision\u201d and that he had \u201cdecided, effectively, \u2018the computer\nsays no, you\u2019re divorced\u2019\u201d.\n\nVardag, who won the landmark ruling in 2010 that German heiress Katrin\nRadmacher\u2019s prenuptial agreement was legally binding, added: \u201cThe state should\nnot be divorcing people on the basis of a clerical error. There has to be\nintention on the part of the person divorcing, because the principle of\nintention underpins the justice of our legal system.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Edition\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s\nhappening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

That means that, for\nnow, our law says that you can be divorced by an error made on an online\nsystem. And that\u2019s just not right, not sensible, not justice.\u201d\n\nVardag told the Law Society Gazette that she was standing behind the solicitor\nwho mistakenly applied for the final order for the Williamses by clicking the\nwrong name from a drop-down menu on the divorce portal.\n\nVardag won a \u00a364m settlement for Pauline Chai, the wife of the Laura Ashley\ntycoon Khoo Kay Peng, in 2017.\n\nShe made headlines in 2019 after sending a memo to staff banning cardigans in\nthe office. In a new dress code issued last year, she said staff could shun\nthe cufflinks and business suits associated with \u201cbankers and estate agents\u201d\nand wear electric blue sequined jackets and gold leather trousers to the\noffice instead.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Divorce\n  * London\n  * Marriage\n  * Family\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Divorces delayed by cost of living crisis, research finds\n\n1 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Women losing out as couples try to divorce \u2018on the cheap\u2019\n\n3 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### No-fault divorce: rush expected as new law introduced in England and Wales\n\n3 Apr 2022\n\n  * ### Ireland votes to liberalise divorce laws after referendum\n\n26 May 2019\n\n  * ### No-fault divorce reform will allow families to function, say lawyers\n\n9 Apr 2019\n\n  * ### No-fault divorce law coming \u2018as soon as parliamentary time allows\u2019\n\n9 Apr 2019\n\n  * ### No-fault divorce to become law\n\n8 Feb 2019\n\n  * ### Thirteen people apply online for divorce on Christmas Day\n\n4 Jan 2019\n\n  * ### Heterosexual divorce in England and Wales is at lowest level since 1973\n\n26 Sept 2018\n\n  * ### UK government to launch consultation on no-fault divorces\n\n7 Sept 2018\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Fashion\n  * Food\n  * Recipes\n  * Love & sex\n  * Health & fitness\n  * Home & garden\n  * Women\n  * Men\n  * Family\n  * Travel\n  * Money\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
