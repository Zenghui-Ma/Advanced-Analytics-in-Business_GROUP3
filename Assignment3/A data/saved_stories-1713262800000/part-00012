She\nfocuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights,\nand has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.\n\nAmy Casciani, a longtime real estate developer whose corporation built housing\nacross seven states, watched her local community struggle for years to add new\nhomes.\n\nCasciani grew up in upstate New York, in a suburban town outside Rochester.\nShe eventually started a family and raised her children there, and in the\nearly 1990s, a new mall opened up, bringing over 100 new stores including\nanchor retailers like Sibley\u2019s, J.C. Penney, and Sears.\n\nThe mall was a proud boon to the town of Irondequoit, and a go-to spot for\nteenagers to hang out. \u201cHands down the most attractive shopping mall in the\narea,\u201d an editorial for a newspaper serving Albany declared. \u201cFrom its blue\nLegolike entrances and splashing fountain to its light-trimmed glass roof,\ncolumns and carousel, the mall exudes carnival gaiety.\u201d\n\nBut in a few short years, retail patterns across the United States began to\nchange. Mall foot traffic slowed and online shopping ticked up. Stores in the\nIrondequoit Mall began to close, and by 2016, the last major anchor, Sears,\ncalled it quits.\n\nCasciani ached for her town, which not only was dealing with the eyesore of\nthe abandoned mall but also lacked enough vacant land to develop desperately\nneeded affordable housing. Her nonprofit development group, PathStone,\nembarked on a complex but meaningful project: They retrofitted the Sears\ndepartment store into 73 rental apartments and built a new four-story\nmultifamily building with 84 rental units on the adjacent parking lot.\n\nPathStone connected the two buildings by a raised pedestrian walkway, and the\nSkyview Park Apartments now serves adults 55 and up who need subsidized\nhousing. Half of the units are reserved for seniors at risk of homelessness,\nwho can receive on-site supportive services.\n\nSkyview Park Apartments\n\nDon Cochran\n\n\u201cAs affordable housing needs and costs keep going up and a shortage of\navailable vacant land is growing, why not use what we already have?\u201d Casciani\nsaid. \u201cWhy not creatively turn it around from being a blight on the community\nto an asset?\u201d\n\nAcross the country, policymakers, researchers, and real estate developers are\npaying more attention to mall conversions like the one in Irondequoit as they\ngrapple with their own shortage of affordable housing. While the Irondequoit\nMall was a traditional mall, strip malls in particular offer some unique\nadvantages, like big empty parking lots, that could make housing redevelopment\nan easier task.\n\nA report last fall from Enterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit\nfocused on increasing housing supply, estimated that strip mall conversions\ncould create more than 700,000 new homes across the United States.\n\nIn 2022, California lawmakers passed a statewide law to help facilitate the\nconversion of empty commercial buildings to housing, with supporters cheering\nthe law\u2019s potential to \u201cunlock\u201d tons of previously unavailable land.\n\nThe Biden administration is also excited about the possibility of converting\nmore vacant strip malls into housing, and in October, released new federal\nguidance to help leaders and developers navigate the unfortunately complex\nfinancing process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a panacea,\u201d said one senior official who works on the\nWhite House\u2019s housing policy and was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cBut it\ncould have a range of self-reinforcing benefits for community and economic\ndevelopment, housing and employment.\u201d\n\n### The biggest barrier to strip mall conversions is zoning\n\nAn old mall on a 23-acre plot of land in a town about 10 miles northwest of\nBoston was in obvious decline. When a developer bought the property for $44\nmillion in 2017, two-thirds of the retail spaces were vacant. By 2021, new\napartments were ready to rent on the property, and today the Woburn Village\nhas 350 rental units, amenities like a fitness center and a swimming pool, and\nretailers that include Sephora and Panera.\n\nPhoto courtesy of EDENS\n\nTurning the struggling Woburn Mall into the bustling Woburn Village has been\nhailed as a great success, but what has made conversions like it so rare is\nthat local zoning laws often preclude them. Many communities have laws barring\nhomes and businesses from coexisting on the same parcel.\n\n\u201cPerhaps most often, the primary barrier toward redevelopment is regulatory,\u201d\nconcluded a report from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), which\nserves 101 cities and towns in the Boston region.\n\nThe MAPC analyzed the potential for more strip mall conversions across the\nGreater Boston area and found over 3,000 strip malls sitting on thousands of\nacres of land. If just the top 10 percent of those candidates were converted\ninto mixed-use development, the planning agency said, more than 125,000 new\nhousing units could be built.\n\nEnterprise Community Partners replicated this analysis to get its estimate of\ncreating over 700,000 new homes nationally by repurposing strip malls,\nincluding 300,000 \u201clower-density\u201d multifamily housing units (such as duplexes,\ntriplexes, and townhouses), and over 400,000 \u201cmedium-density\u201d housing units\n(defined as a property with up to six stories and an average unit size of\n1,100 square feet).\n\nPhoto courtesy of EDENS\n\nAcross the US, there is 947.5 million square feet of strip mall space,\naccording to the International Council of Shopping Centers. \u201cWe just looked at\nthe 10 percent that were most well-suited for conversion based on factors like\nparcel size, proximity to transit, conditions, and vacancy, but it could be\nmuch more than that if you changed some of those assumptions,\u201d said Ahmad Abu-\nKhalaf, a senior research analyst who wrote the Enterprise report.\n\nLike the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Abu-Khalaf sees rewriting local\nzoning laws as the biggest barrier to conversions, which is why California\nauthorizing retrofits statewide two years ago was such a big deal. This\nsummer, a California state agency that oversees building code regulations went\na step further and voted to make it even easier for developers to convert\ncommercial property into new housing.\n\nStates could follow California\u2019s example or pass alternative incentives that\nencourage local cities to update their zoning rules.\n\n### The idea is spreading\n\nFollowing the pandemic and the growth of remote work, policymakers grew more\ninterested in converting empty office buildings into housing, especially those\nlocated in dense, urban areas. But such conversions have often been harder and\nmore expensive than leaders originally envisioned.\n\nStrip malls, on the other hand, offer some unique opportunities. As Abu-Khalaf\nnoted, many strip malls nationwide are already more than seven decades old and\nneed long-backlogged repairs. The maintenance cost for these older buildings\nis often more expensive than the cost of just demolishing them and rebuilding.\n\nStrip malls are also typically built on property that includes large amounts\nof surface parking, which can make it easier for developers to build new\nprojects. In Atlanta, for example, a shopping center that opened in the 1960s\nwas bulldozed last year to make way for nearly 700 new housing units,\nincluding townhomes and multifamily apartments.\n\nThe senior housing official said converting strip malls could be particularly\nimportant as the nation\u2019s housing crisis has spread out beyond just high-cost\ncities. Today, workers and families struggle to find housing near jobs even in\nsuburban and rural areas, and many strip malls are located in the suburbs.\n\nIn 2023, the Biden administration opened up more funding for such housing\nconversions and directed agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment to prioritize these types of requests. The General Services\nAdministration, which helps manage and support federal agencies, also put out\nnew guidance emphasizing which federal properties could potentially be\nredeveloped into new housing. Since October, according to the White House,\nmore real estate developers have expressed interest in tapping into these\nresources and technical assistance for new projects.\n\n\u201cThis is not an easy development to accomplish, but I believe it\u2019s a necessary\none to accomplish,\u201d Casciani, the real estate developer from New York, told\nme. \u201cI think it can make an even bigger impact on communities than new\nconstruction.\u201d\n\n### You've read 1 article in the last 30 days.\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
