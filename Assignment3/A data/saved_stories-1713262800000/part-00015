One such solution lies in the ancient Aztec agricultural\ntechnique known as 'chinampas', or floating gardens. This ingenious practice\nholds significant promise for addressing the challenges of urban agriculture\nand food security in the 21st century.\n\nThe Mesoamerican agriculture method known as chinampa (Nahuatl languages:\nchin\u0101mitl [t\u0283i\u02c8na\u02d0mit\u026c]) relies on small, rectangular plots of fertile arable\nground to cultivate crops on the shallow lake beds in the Valley of Mexico.\nThey are constructed for agricultural use on freshwater swamps or lake\nwetlands, and their proportions guarantee the best moisture retention.\n\n## The History of Chinampas\n\nThe chinampas were developed by the Aztecs around the 14th century in the\nValley of Mexico, primarily in the shallow lakes of Xochimilco and Chalco.\nThis region, now part of Mexico City, provided a fertile ground for the growth\nof the Aztec civilization. The chinampas were created by building small,\nrectangular plots of land on shallow lake beds, made from layers of mud,\ndecaying vegetation, and other organic matter. These plots were surrounded by\ncanals, allowing for easy transportation and irrigation.\n\nAlthough the Post-classic and Colonial periods in the basin used various\ntechnologies, chinampas have highlighted many concerns about agricultural\nproduction and political growth. One of the earliest methods of imperial\nexpansion after the formation of the Aztec Triple Alliance was the conquest of\ncity-states in the southern basin, such as Xochimilco. Prior to this, farmers\nin the freshwater lakes of Xochimilco and Chalco maintained modest chinampas\nclose to their homes and villages.\n\nThe Aztec culture is credited with creating chinampas. Chinampas, often known\nas \"floating gardens,\" are man-made islands that were built by braiding reeds\nwith stakes below the water's surface to form underwater fences. These\n\"fences\" would accumulate soil and aquatic vegetation up until the top soil\nlayer was exposed on the water's surface. Because of the illusion they\ncreated, these agricultural regions were given this moniker. The canals\nencircled the chinampa plots, giving the impression that the areas of land\nwere \"floating\" on the water.\n\n## Agricultural Innovation\n\nThe chinampas proved to be highly productive and sustainable agricultural\nsystems. Due to the nutrient-rich materials used to construct them, they\nprovided fertile soil that could support diverse crops such as maize, beans,\nsquash, tomatoes, chili peppers, and even flowers. The water surrounding the\nchinampas provided a natural irrigation system, reducing the need for\nartificial irrigation methods. Moreover, the canals between chinampas were\nhome to fish and aquatic birds, creating a balanced ecosystem that supported\nboth plant and animal life.\n\nThe lake system within the Valley of Mexico at the time of the Spanish\nConquest, showing distribution of the chinampas.\n\nAs part of the construction process for chinampas, a drainage system was also\ncreated. This drainage system had multiple functions. To facilitate the\nmovement of water and sediments, maybe even night soil, a canal was made. The\nditch would gradually fill with mud over time. The obstruction would then be\nremoved by digging up some of this mud and spreading it across the chinampas.\nBecause the dirt at the lake's bottom was so nutrient-rich, it served as an\nefficient and effective fertilizer for the chinampas.\n\nRich crops were made possible by adding lost nutrients to the topsoil.\nEmbarcadero-Jim\u00e9nez and associates investigated the relationship between soil\nbacterial diversity and environmental factors. A wide variety of bacteria may\nhave an impact on the nutrients in the soil, according to theory. The findings\nshowed that cultivated soils have higher levels of bacterial diversity than\nnon-cultivated soils. Also, \"the organization of the bacterial communities\nindicated an unusual link of the S-cycle and iron-oxidizing bacteria with the\nrhizosphere of plants cultivated in the chinampa soil and showed that the\nchinampas constitute a transition system between sediment and soil.\"\n\nChinampas were likely enumerated in groups of seven and measured in matl (1\nmatl = 1.67 meters), according to evidence from Nahuatl wills from late\nseventeenth-century Pueblo Culhuac\u00e1n. One researcher used the Codex Vergara as\na source to determine the size of chinampas. They were made by marking the\nsmall lake bed with stakes and enclosing it with a wattle fence. Later, layers\nof muck, lake sediment, and decomposing plants were added to the fence-lined\narea, raising it over the lake's level. To protect the chinampa, trees like\nhuextl (Salix bonplandiana), a willow, and huhutl (Taxodium mucronatum), a\ncypress, were frequently placed at the corners.\n\nThe lengthy raised beds were sometimes interspersed with ditches, which\nprovided plants with constant access to water and made the crops planted there\nindependent of rainfall. Channels big enough for a canoe to pass between\nChinampas. With up to 7 harvests each year, these elevated, well-watered beds\nproduced extremely high crop yields. Prior to European colonization, Chinampas\nwere widely utilized throughout Mexico and Central America. There is proof\nthat the earliest chinampas were built in C.E. 1100 at the Nahua village of\nCulhuacan, which was located on the southern tip of the Ixtapalapa peninsula,\nwhich separated Lake Texcoco from Lake Xochimilco.\n\nAztec maize agriculture as depicted in the Florentine Codex with the\ncultivator using a digging stick\n\n## Relevance for Modern Urban Agriculture\n\nAs urban populations continue to expand, traditional agricultural practices\nare becoming increasingly unsustainable due to land scarcity and environmental\nconcerns. The chinampas system offers several benefits that could help address\nthese challenges:\n\n  1. Space Efficiency: Chinampas maximize the use of limited space in urban environments, enabling food production in areas that might otherwise be unsuitable for agriculture. By creating floating gardens on bodies of water, chinampas allow for the productive use of urban waterways.\n\n  2. Biodiversity: The chinampas system promotes biodiversity by creating a rich, interconnected ecosystem that supports both plant and animal life. This leads to healthier and more resilient crops, reducing the need for chemical inputs.\n\n  3. Sustainable Water Management: The chinampas' natural irrigation system conserves water and reduces the need for energy-intensive pumping and distribution systems.\n\n  4. Carbon Sequestration: The organic matter used in chinampas construction, combined with the plant life it supports, helps capture and store carbon, mitigating the effects of climate change.\n\n  5. Community Engagement: Chinampas can foster social cohesion and promote urban greening by engaging local communities in food production and providing green spaces for recreation and relaxation.\n\n## Modern Chinampas around the world\n\nThe potential of chinampas has not gone unnoticed. Various projects around the\nworld have been inspired by this ancient technique, including the Floating\nGardens of Bangladesh, the Green Float project in Osaka Bay, Japan, and the\nUrban Rivers project in Chicago, USA. These projects showcase the versatility\nand adaptability of chinampas in addressing food security, environmental\nsustainability, and urbanization challenges.\n\nIn addition to San Luis, Tlahuac, and Mixquic, chinampas are still extant at\nSan Gregorio, a small village east of Xochimilco, as of 1998. Several of these\nland parcels still exist and are in use, despite the fact that many of these\nfloating gardens were built and meticulously maintained from the Postclassic\nPeriod through the Spanish conquest.\n\nSeveral of these chinampas have been permitted to overgrow by modern farmers.\n\nWhile others choose to utilize kayaks for farming, more and more people are\nrelying on wheelbarrows and bicycles for transportation.\n\nSome fields have been purposefully filled in, including ones in the San\nGregorio and San Luis areas.\n\nSome of the fields are organically connected together when the canals dry up.\nAlthough not used for their original purpose, they are commonly used for\ncattle feed.\n\nAn example of a modern-day chinampa.\n\nOther fields, both dried and surrounded by canals, produce foods such as\nlettuce, cilantro, spinach, chard, squash, parsley, coriander, cauliflower,\ncelery, mint, chives, rosemary, corn, and radishes. The young leaves of\nquelites and quintoniles, which are often mistaken for weeds, are grown and\nharvested as ingredients of sauces. Flowers also continue to be grown on these\nplots. Some chinampa fields are even used as tourist sites.\n\nFrom La Chinampa a Tu Mesa, which translates to \"From the Floating Isle to\nYour Table,\" serves as both. Chinampas, many of which can be found on the\ncanals of Xochimilco, are used by his company in collaboration with local\nfarmers to revive traditional agriculture. Rodriguez has combined conventional\nproduction methods with cutting-edge technologies in an effort to preserve the\neffective and long-standing chinampa agricultural method. Consumers can\nregister on his website to have fresh vegetables picked collected in the\nchinampas delivered to their homes.\n\n> We (De La Chinampa a Tu Mesa) help generate demand, which motivates them\n> (chinampa farmers) to keep farming. And this helps restore the chinampas.\n> The market is starting to recognize the value of the chinampas.\n>\n> \u2014 Ricardo Rodriguez\n\nDespite the fact that many townspeople and farmers are pleased to be returning\nto their agricultural heritage, they nonetheless confront a number of\ndifficulties. Many of the lakes were drained as part of the Spanish conquest.\nSadly, this reduced the lakes' ability to support agriculture, including the\nlake at Xochimilco. Moreover, an earthquake that occurred in 1985 further\nharmed a number of the canals. Additional issues include the scarcity of\nwater, the usage of pesticides, climate change, urban development, and water\npollution from toxic waste and untreated sewage.\n\nThe ancient Aztec chinampas system, with its unique combination of\nsustainability, space efficiency, and biodiversity, offers a promising\nsolution to the challenges of modern urban agriculture. By embracing this\ntime-tested technique, cities around the world can address food security\nconcerns, promote environmental stewardship, and enhance the well-being of\nurban residents.\n\nIn Americas Tags D, Archaeology's Greatest Finds\n\nFeatured\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nRivers of Life: The Foundation of Ancient Civilizations\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nWhy Most \"Ancient\" Buildings are Fakes\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nThe Giza Pyramid of the First Female Pharaoh?\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nThe Strange Ancient \"Alien\" Artifacts of the Lost Civilization of Sanxingdui\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nA unique astronomical phenomenon will provide insights into the lunar\nassociation of Stonehenge.\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nAncient Henge Unearthed Near Crowland Abbey\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nread more\n\nPowered by The archaeologist\n\n", "frontpage": true}
