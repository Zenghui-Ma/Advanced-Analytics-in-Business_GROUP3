(Image credit: NASA/Mike Hopkins)\n\nThe mysterious object that crashed through the roof of a Florida home last\nmonth did indeed come from the International Space Station (ISS), NASA has\nconfirmed.\n\nThat home, in the seaside city of Naples, belongs to Alejandro Otero. Shortly\nafter the March 8 incident, Otero said he thought the offending object was\npart of a cargo pallet packed with 5,800 pounds (2,630 kilograms) of aging\nbatteries jettisoned from the ISS in March 2021.\n\nAnd he was right, according to a new NASA analysis of the object, which was\nperformed at Florida's Kennedy Space Center.\n\n\"Based on the examination, the agency determined the debris to be a stanchion\nfrom the NASA flight support equipment used to mount the batteries on the\ncargo pallet,\" agency officials wrote in an update today (April 15).\n\nThe cylindrical piece of space junk is made of a metallic alloy called\nInconel, they added. It weighs 1.6 pounds (0.7 kg) and measures 4 inches (10\ncentimeters) high by 1.6 inches (4 cm) wide.\n\nRelated: 5,800 pounds of batteries tossed off the ISS in 2021 will fall to\nEarth\n\nRecovered stanchion from the NASA flight support equipment used to mount\nInternational Space Station batteries on a cargo pallet. The stanchion\nsurvived re-entry through Earth\u2019s atmosphere on March 8, 2024, and impacted a\nhome in Naples, Florida. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThe nickel-hydride batteries were dumped after new lithium-ion versions were\ndelivered to the ISS for a power-supply upgrade. The pallet and the batteries\nwere expected to burn up completely in Earth's atmosphere, NASA officials said\nin today's update \u2014 yet that didn't happen, and the agency wants to learn why.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\"The International Space Station will perform a detailed investigation of the\njettison and reentry analysis to determine the cause of the debris survival\nand to update modeling and analysis, as needed,\" NASA officials wrote in\ntoday's update.\n\n\"NASA specialists use engineering models to estimate how objects heat up and\nbreak apart during atmospheric reentry,\" they added. \"These models require\ndetailed input parameters and are regularly updated when debris is found to\nhave survived atmospheric reentry to the ground.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Mysterious object that crashed through Florida home was likely space junk\nfrom the International Space Station\n\n\u2014 Chinese space junk falls to Earth over Southern California, creating\nspectacular fireball (photos, video)\n\n\u2014 Kessler Syndrome and the space debris problem\n\nOtero's experience serves as a reminder that there's a tremendous amount of\nhardware whizzing over our heads.\n\nAccording to the European Space Agency, Earth orbit hosts about 36,500 pieces\nof space junk at least 4 inches (10 cm) wide, and a whopping 130 million\nobjects at least 1 millimeter in diameter. Even these tiny shards pose a\ndanger to satellites and other orbiting assets, given the tremendous speeds at\nwhich they travel. For example, at 250 miles (400 kilometers) up \u2014 the average\naltitude of the ISS \u2014 orbital velocity is about 17,000 mph (27,400 kph).\n\nAnd, as has been demonstrated, some of this junk comes crashing back to Earth\nfrom time to time. For instance, the 23-ton core stages of China's powerful\nLong March 5B rocket routinely fall in an uncontrolled fashion a week or so\nafter their launches, to the consternation of the international space\ncommunity.\n\nNASA's new analysis may have financial consequences for the agency and for\nOtero, by the way.\n\n\"I eagerly await communication from the responsible agencies, as their\nassistance is crucial in resolving the damages from this deliberate release.\nBut more importantly how in the future to arrange the payload so it will burn\nin its entirety as it reenters,\" Otero wrote via X on March 8, shortly after\nhis home was hit.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

Inconel alloys are oxidation- and corrosion-resistant. When\nheated, Inconel forms a thick, stable, passivating oxide layer protecting the\nsurface from further attack. Inconel retains strength over a wide temperature\nrange, attractive for high-temperature applications where aluminium and steel\nwould succumb to creep as a result of thermally-induced crystal vacancies.\"\n\nIt is also not cheap.
