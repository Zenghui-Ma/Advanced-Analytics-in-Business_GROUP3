All of these\npeople are arriving because of a rounding error on a GPS location, which\nwrongly points people to their farm.\n\nIn their lawsuit filed against MaxMind, the IP mapping firm, the Arnolds\nallege:\n\n> The following events appeared to originate at the residence and brought\n> trespassers and/or law enforcement to the plaintiffs\u2019 home at all hours of\n> the night and day: stolen cars, fraud related to tax returns and bitcoin,\n> stolen credit cards, suicide calls, private investigators, stolen social\n> media accounts, fund raising events, and numerous other events.\n\nJames Arnold has even been \u201creported as holding girls at the residence for the\npurpose of making pornographic films.\u201d\n\nAccording to the suit, which was filed last Friday in Kansas federal court,\nall of these accusations were and continue to be false. Earlier this year, the\nnews site Fusion revealed to the Arnold family and to the world why so many\npeople continuously turn up at the Butler County farm.\n\nAs Fusion\u2019s Kashmir Hill reported:\n\n> As any geography nerd knows, the precise center of the United States is in\n> northern Kansas, near the Nebraska border. Technically, the latitudinal and\n> longitudinal coordinates of the center spot are 39\u00b050\u2032N 98\u00b035\u2032W. In digital\n> maps, that number is an ugly one: 39.8333333,-98.585522. So back in 2002,\n> when MaxMind was first choosing the default point on its digital map for the\n> center of the U.S., it decided to clean up the measurements and go with a\n> simpler, nearby latitude and longitude: 38\u00b0N 97\u00b0W or 38.0000,-97.0000.\n>\n> As a result, for the last 14 years, every time MaxMind\u2019s database has been\n> queried about the location of an IP address in the United States it can\u2019t\n> identify, it has spit out the default location of a spot two hours away from\n> the geographic center of the country. This happens a lot: 5,000 companies\n> rely on MaxMind\u2019s IP mapping information, and in all, there are now over 600\n> million IP addresses associated with that default coordinate. If any of\n> those IP addresses are used by a scammer, or a computer thief, or a suicidal\n> person contacting a help line, MaxMind\u2019s database places them at the same\n> spot: 38.0000,-97.0000.\n\nAnd that precise GPS location is exactly where the Arnold family lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRandall Rathbun, the Arnolds\u2019 lawyer, told Ars that this continues even now,\nmonths after Hill uncovered MaxMind\u2019s error. \u201cI think the last time the\nsheriff\u2019s office was out was a month ago,\u201d he said.\n\nTo its credit, MaxMind has since fixed the error in its IP databases by moving\nthe location of a default IP address to the middle of a Kansas lake, but\ncustomers do not often update their data, so it could be many years before\nthis issue is fully resolved.\n\nDavid Robbins, a company spokesman, declined comment.\n\n\u201cThanks for reaching out to us,\u201d he said. \u201cMaxMind is aware of the lawsuit but\ndoes not comment on pending litigation.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a judgement of at least $75,000, but Rathbun told Ars that\nhe would likely seek more in forthcoming filings.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n254\n\nCyrus Farivar Cyrus is a former Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica,\nand is also a radio producer and author.
