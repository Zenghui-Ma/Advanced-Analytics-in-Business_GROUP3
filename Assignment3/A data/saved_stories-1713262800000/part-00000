But\nthe times, they\u2019ve been a-changin\u2019. In the 1960s, universities stood at the\nvanguard of the Free Speech Movement. Today, they have become places where\nspeech goes to be endlessly deconstructed, constrained, stigmatized, rioted\nagainst, and shouted down. According to the 2024 Spotlight on Speech Codes\nreport from FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression), a mere\n12.9 percent of the 489 schools they examined earned a \u201cgreen light\u201d score for\nspeech policies that \u201cdo not seriously imperil free expression.\u201d The ACLU\n(American Civil Liberties Union) used to defend the speech rights of neo-\nNazis, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Westboro Baptist Church. Today, they not only\nroutinely decline to defend so-called \u201chate speech\u201d, high-ranking ACLU\nofficials now call for book bannings.\n\nFree speech has disastrously become a polarized issue, but with partisan\ncrisis comes partisan opportunity. The erosion of left-institutional support\nfor free expression created a market for pro-speech and anti-censorship news\ncoverage and commentary \u2014 one dominated by right-of-center audiences. And thus\nthe negative feedback loop began. The louder free speech advocacy grew on the\nright, the more rank-and-file progressives came to mistakenly view free\nexpression as a right-coded issue. But, in all fairness, too many speech\nadvocates in recent years have both greatly enabled and profited from this\nspiral of left-wing speech-skepticism.\n\nA recent case in point, and one that hits close to home for me, involves the\njournalist and author Matt Taibbi. In late March, Taibbi, who has been\ncovering issues surrounding free speech and censorship for the past few years,\nfound himself trending on Twitter as the result of a spat with fellow reporter\nZaid Jilani. The feud erupted over a Substack note Taibbi had posted in which\nhe explained why his reporting, which was once politically wide-ranging, now\nno longer criticizes Republicans or the political right. Jilani accused Taibbi\nof abandoning his principles in order to pander to his large, recently\namassed, and lucrative right-wing audience. Matt Taibbi\u2019s arc is worth taking\na closer look at because it offers an important lesson. The fact that free\nspeech is increasingly seen as a \u201cright-wing dog whistle\u201d on the left is as\ndismaying as it is truly insane. But if First Amendment advocates harp on\nspeech and censorship in a way that exclusively bashes the left, we only feed\nthis narrative, and by extension, the destructive polarization wearing away at\nspeech rights.\n\nMatt Taibbi used to be a progressive darling. As a star reporter for Rolling\nStone, he produced some of the most incisive, witty, and widely read reporting\non the 2008 financial crisis, including his celebrated 2009 article \u201cThe Great\nAmerican Bubble Machine.\u201d His book-length expos\u00e9s of foreign policy, the\nfinancial crash, and the justice system, The Great Derangement (2008),\nGriftopia (2010), The Divide (2014), all became New York Times bestsellers.\nJames Wolcott described him as \"The funniest angry writer and the angriest\nfunny writer since Hunter S. Thompson roared into town.\" Taibbi\u2019s writing, for\nwhich he won a 2008 National Magazine Award, made such inroads in the culture\nthat Eric Bates, a former senior editor at Rolling Stone, recounted, \u201cWe had\ninterviewed Obama a number of times and we would get reader questions asking,\n\u2018What\u2019s he like?\u2019 We started to get that with Matt. \u2018What\u2019s he like?\u2019 No one\ndoes that with a writer. Most people in the world aren\u2019t curious about what a\nwriter is like as a person.\u201d\n\nNow, Taibbi\u2019s erstwhile left-leaning fans regard him as a right-wing shill,\ndespite his insistence that his politics have not changed. As someone who is\naccused of being a right-winger on a weekly basis despite not being one, I\nsympathize with Taibbi\u2019s plight. I am acutely aware that the moment someone\ntrespasses beyond the ever-shrinking boundaries of acceptable thought on the\npolitical left, they can expect to be pilloried as a reactionary ghoul hardly\nremoved from an avowed fascist. But it\u2019s more than just sympathy I feel toward\nMatt Taibbi \u2014 I like him. I\u2019ve been an avid reader of his for more than 15\nyears. I\u2019m a paying subscriber to his publication, Racket News. He\u2019s a\nwonderfully colorful writer whose style has influenced my own.\n\nWere it simply a matter of Taibbi moving on from covering left-coded issues to\nright-coded ones \u2014 however confused such codings are \u2014 I would consider the\nleft-wing vitriol Taibbi now receives to be much ado about nothing. It\u2019s his\nchoice to only cover speech issues involving left-wing overreach that\u2019s the\nproblem. Jilani summed up my own thoughts when he wrote, \u201cI read Taibbi even\nas a teenager. I would think this guy goes after Democrats, he goes after\nRepublicans. He\u2019s the fierce independent journalist we need. He inspired me.\nNow I\u2019m seeing him get captured by an audience [and] pander to a base.\u201d\n\nTaibbi disputes this characterization, but you can only ask readers not to\nbelieve their own lying eyes for so long. I\u2019ve read probably 80 percent of\nwhat the man has written over the past decade. Over that span, he went from a\nlegitimately independent-minded journalist who took swings at every side when\nneeded, to someone who now takes aim squarely and virtually exclusively at\nDemocrats and the left. Regardless of whether this represents audience capture\nor a change in his political views, the shift not just in coverage, but in the\nway subjects are covered, has been so massive you can practically see it from\nspace. Taibbi\u2019s writing produces the same barbed prose, and his reporting has\nthe same attention to detail and accuracy. But these skills are now bent in\nthe service of straightforwardly partisan ends. The essence of Taibbi\u2019s\ndevolution is perfectly distilled in his unlistenable weekly podcast, America\nThis Week, where he tees up a roster of sometimes obscure but always right-\npopulist-friendly news items for co-host Walter Kirn to take interminably\nbloviating swings at.\n\nTaibbi\u2019s arc is emblematic of the deeply troubling manner in which speech\nissues are often discussed more broadly in modern society. Free speech is an\nenormously important issue, and few endeavors are more valuable than defending\nit. But you don\u2019t have to be a right-winger to stand up for free speech. You\ndon\u2019t have to vindicate leftist confusion by giving speech advocacy the\nappearance of a partisan right-wing project.\n\nThe aforementioned FIRE, which expanded in 2022 from a university-speech\nfocused group to a broader free speech organization after the ACLU went AWOL\non civil liberties, is perhaps the model example of how to advocate for free\nexpression. Their support for the First Amendment is as robust and impeccable\nas it is possible to be, and they do so without pandering to right-wing\naudiences. FIRE covers incidents of left-wing censoriousness as well as those\non the right. Even little ol\u2019 me can manage to write about free speech without\nbeing partisan. I\u2019ve criticized left-wing speech problems such as youth\nattitudes toward speech, stealth editing literary classics, and criminalizing\nhate speech. I\u2019ve also criticized right-wing speech problems such as banning\ncritical race theory, removing an Anne Frank graphic novel from libraries, and\nFlorida legislation that effectively outlaws Pride parades. Hell, I\u2019ve even\ndefended the speech rights of anti-Semites. Because free speech is under\nattack from every direction, covering it without looking like a stooge is not\nexactly rocket science.\n\nAs a writer and editor with politically moderate, small-l liberal views, I\nfind writing and publishing criticisms of all sides to be the most natural\nthing in the world. To my way of thinking, the idea of exclusively focusing on\nthe problems with one side would be untenable unless I really did become a\npartisan hack. There are simply too many things on the left and the right I\nfind contemptible for me to keep my mouth shut about either. If I\u2019d spent the\nlast four or five years solely investigating the wrongdoings associated with\nthe political left or the Democratic Party while staying silent about the\nother side of the aisle, I would expect to be seen as a right-wing partisan,\neven if I wasn\u2019t one. To expect otherwise would be to pretend that human\nnature doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn a 2021 profile of Matt Taibbi in New York Magazine, Ross Barkan writes that\nTaibbi sees his work as being inspired by H.L. Mencken, the deliciously\nacerbic early 20th-century writer and critic (and another influence on me). As\nhe told Barkan, \u201cEspecially in an atmosphere where people feel constrained and\nafraid to say certain things, I think there\u2019s a role for someone to try to do\nwhat Mencken did, which was basically undress everyone and skewer sacred\ncows.\u201d If only Taibbi and his many right-pandering fellow travelers were more\nMenckenian in their approach. In reality, they aren\u2019t \u201cundressing everyone\u201d \u2014\nthey\u2019re choosing sides and thereby inadvertently undressing themselves.\n\nIt should go without saying that people can cover whatever they want in\nwhatever way they want. I wouldn\u2019t be much of a free speech advocate if I\ndidn\u2019t believe that. But selective speech advocacy is not true speech\nadvocacy. Pouring gasoline on the partisan bonfire upon which free speech is\nbeing roasted might be an effective way to line your pockets, but it\u2019s a\nhorrible strategy to actually protect speech rights.\n\nBoth the left and the right have revealed themselves to be cynical and\nunprincipled opportunists who champion free speech when they are in the\ncultural or institutional minority, and jettison it the moment the levers of\npower are safely in hand. Free speech was never a left or a right issue,\nregardless of which side happens to fraudulently claim its mantle at any given\nsnapshot in time. If we want to protect our own freedoms, we must protect the\nfreedoms of others. Thomas Paine knew this in 1795. When rights become\nselective, or partisan, they cease to be rights. There\u2019s nothing right-wing\nabout free speech, but if we lend credence to that misconception by only\ncovering left-wing problems, we accelerate this pernicious trend. It\u2019s up to\nthose of us who oppose censorship and defend free speech to do so in a way\nthat doesn\u2019t empower the very censors we strive against.\n\nSee also: \u201cReverse Psychology Is an Untapped Political Gold Mine\u201d\n\nShare\n\nSubscribe now and never miss a new post.

Very much appreciate your perspectives.\nI'm not seeing this one. I read Taibbi's Substack Note explanation, and, for\nwhatever subjective reasons that inform my viewpoint and frame, it rings true.\nI suppose this is the fascinating thing about human beings. We're all so\ndifferent, can have very different impressions of things, and somehow, as\ndifferent as those perspectives can be, both can be correct. I suspect\nsomething of that kind is in operation here.I'm not seeing the \"audience\ncapture\" phenomenon here--that Taibbi is writing to capitalize on a lucrative\nopportunity. Selling out/grift. My impression is more that the guy is\ngenuinely terrified and disturbed by the crazy amount of power that \"the Left\"\n(hate these terms) is wielding right now. Cultural power up the wazoo, and\nincredible imposition of norms through every sector you can think of, but\nespecially the professions.For what it's worth, I've always been a \"center\nLeft\" guy. NYTimes reader. The Atlantic. WaPo. Voted Dem my whole life.\nEducated technocrat type. All of that has been destabilized. It's this group\nof \"former normies\" that I suspect Taibbi appeals to.Continuing thanks for\nyour work and your perspective!Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\nKeese1 hr agoTaibbi said that part of why he focuses on the left is that\neveryone else is already adequately covering the misdeeds of the right; do you\ndisagree?Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 more comments...\n\nIntent Doesn\u2019t Matter?\n\nLet\u2019s Think This Through Here\n\nFeb 19, 2021 \u2022\n\nJamie Paul\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Intent Doesn\u2019t Matter?\n\namericandreaming.substack.com\n\n3\n\nCollege Was the Biggest Mistake of My Life\n\nWe desperately need a change in culture.\n\nApr 23, 2022 \u2022\n\nJamie Paul\n\n7\n\nShare this post\n\n#### College Was the Biggest Mistake of My Life\n\namericandreaming.substack.com\n\n5\n\nAndrew Yang\u2019s New \"Forward\" Party Isn't What You Think\n\nOn third parties in general, the Forward Party in particular, and why the\noutrage is overblown.\n\nOct 14, 2021 \u2022\n\nJamie Paul\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Andrew Yang\u2019s New \"Forward\" Party Isn't What You Think\n\namericandreaming.substack.com\n\n6\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 American Dreaming\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
