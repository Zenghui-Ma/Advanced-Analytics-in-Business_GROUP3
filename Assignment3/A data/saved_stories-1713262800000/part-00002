Yeah, me too. \ud83e\udd28\n\nThe goal of this article is to give you a better sense of what is what in AI,\nwhere things begin and end. Definitions often rely on arbitrarily choosing\nwhere things start and end. But in AI as in Nature, things may be fuzzy and\noverlap. Unless cited, the nomenclatures and definitions below are my own.\n\n# Artificial Intelligence, a recipe for success!\n\nI like Alan Turing\u2019s definition for Artificial Intelligence for its\nsimplicity:\n\n> Artificial Intelligence is a decision made by a computer, which by its\n> smartness, is indistinguishable from a human-made decision.\n\nPeople often claim that AI is \u201cill-defined\u201d, because Alan Turing\u2019s definition\nis very broad. I think it seems ill-defined because it forces us to confront\nour ignorance about human consciousness and intelligence, and it is also easy\nto confuse thinking (in the sense of cognition, not emotion) and computing.\n\nAt the essence of it, what is a decision made by a machine? According to Alan\nTuring\u2019s definition, technically, a clever macro in Excel would be an AI.\nWell, yes. A set of rules, like \u201cif this: do that; else: do that other thing\u201d,\nif executed by a computer, is an AI.\n\nGenerating those rules can be very difficult and/or expensive. Nobody wants to\nsit at a computer, typing every possible scenario and defining the action in\neach case. So AI is not so much about the decision taken, but how the decision\nwas reached. How can we learn to generate those rules automatically, at scale,\nno matter the situation? That is what the field of AI is concerned about.\n\n## What is an AI?\n\nConcretely, for a computer to take a decision, it needs to follow a computer\nprogram, a set of instruction. This set of instruction is called an algorithm.\nThink of it as a recipe.\n\nLet\u2019s cook an algorithm together! \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udf73\n\nConsider a recipe for a cake, and let\u2019s write it down mathematically as f().\nYour recipe f() takes some ingredients (which we will call input): f(flour,\nbutter, milk, egg). So your recipe (algorithm) f() tells you what to do with\nyour ingredients (inputs). You mix them, put them in a mold, into the oven at\nsome temperature for some time, et voil\u00e0! \ud83c\udf70! The cake is the output, let\u2019s\nnote it y.\n\nAn algorithm is a set of instruction f(), which once applied to your input x,\nwill output y.\n\n> f(x) = y\n\nThe whole point of AI is figuring out how to create f() such that when you\ngive it your input x, you get what you want as y.\n\n# Tasks, Tools, and the rule of Three\n\nTo sort out the buzzword salad of AI, I like to divide things this way:\n\n  * What can AI do: The type of tasks AI can do.\n  * How can AI do it: The type of (mathematical) tools AI can use.\n  * Where can AI do it: The domains of application of AI.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in! \ud83c\udfca\u2640\ufe0f\n\n> A note: The following nomenclature is my own way of explaining an enormous\n> field. It is meant as an comprehensive but not exhaustive introduction.\n\n## What can AI do?\n\nArtificial Intelligence, in essence, is a large collection of algorithms,\ngrouped in families, and each family does very specific things. What are those\nspecific things?\n\n  * Machine Learning: What group does this x belong to? Y is the group.\n  * Data Mining: What patterns exist in this data x? Y is the pattern.\n  * Reinforcement Learning: What is the next best action given where I am (x)? Y is the action you probably should take.\n  * Optimization: What\u2019s the best solution given problem x? Y is the solution.\n\n### Machine Learning\n\nWhat is the difference between Machine Learning (ML) and AI? ML is a sub-\nfamily of algorithms within the larger AI domain, and focuses on grouping\nthings. As an example, let\u2019s look at a collection of photos. Some photos have\nmuffins on them, and some photos have dogs. We want to automatically group the\nphotos, somehow.\n\n#### Grouping when you know the groups\n\nIf some photos are already labelled based on \ud83e\uddc1 or \ud83d\udc36, then we already know what\ngroup exists (muffin and dog). The algorithm will learn from the labelled data\nwhat is a \ud83e\uddc1 or \ud83d\udc36, and continue labeling the rest of the data. This is called\nclassification, where the class is the group. It is also called supervised\nlearning , because the learning is \u201csupervised\u201d by the existing labels.\n\n### Grouping when you don\u2019t know the groups\n\nIf none of the photos are labeled, then this is unsupervised learning. In this\ncase, the algorithm will group (or cluster) things based on how similar they\nare. This is also called clustering.\n\n### ML & Prediction\n\nA supervised or unsupervised algorithm doesn\u2019t output \ud83e\uddc1 or \ud83d\udc36, but rather a\nprobability that an image has \ud83e\uddc1 or \ud83d\udc36 on it. This probability is what is used\nwhen predicting things like customer churn (In this case, the groups are:\ncustomer churns, customer renews).\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s hard to tell \ud83e\uddc1 or \ud83d\udc36!\n\n### Data Mining\n\nThe apocryphal origin of Data Mining tells the story of a retail chain\nanalyzing their transaction receipts with the Apriori algorithm (my 2nd\nfavorite algorithm), and discovering a correlation between beer and diapers on\nsunday afternoons. The story goes that new dads, watching the football game on\nSunday afternoon, were sent to the store to resupply on diapers, and thinking\nabout the game, resupplied on beer as well. The store put the diapers next to\nthe beer, and sales increased.\n\nWhile this story is probably not true, you have very likely heard of Target\nsending coupon to a pregnant teen before she knew she was pregnant. That, my\ndear reader, is Data Mining \ud83e\udd23.\n\nThose two stories are hinting at the difference with Machine Learning. Both ML\nand Data Mining are looking for patterns, but those patterns don\u2019t have the\nsame structure. What grouping would be the most relevant among millions of\nreceipts? Thinking of the problem another way, finding association of items\nthat repeats sufficiently to be noticeable, that is a pattern! In essence,\nthis is Data Mining: finding patterns that repeat \ud83e\udde9.\n\n### Reinforcement Learning\n\nReinforcement Learning algorithms focus on finding the best next action, when\nthe problem is a sequential decision making problem. For instance, you are\nplaying chess. What\u2019s the next best move for you to do?\n\nRL used to be the poor child of AI, because it takes a lot computational power\nto calculate. Each next step has a number of possibilities, which increase\nexponentially with step, and makes the future very hard (computationally\nexpensive) to predict. Recent progress in optimization (i.e., how to do things\nmore efficiently) has given rise to actual applications of RL, like AlphaGo.\n\n> A side note about a pet peeve of mine. Wikipedia claims that RL is \u201can area\n> of Machine Learning\u201d. I disagree with this assertion. Clustering and\n> classification are different tasks altogether than sequential decision\n> making. While there are some overlaps in algorithm/task/data between ML and\n> Data Mining, ML and RL differ greatly in the type of algorithms AND the type\n> of tasks AND the type of data they use. Nomenclatures are arbitrary, and\n> this is a hill with 0-feet altitude, but I am a nerd and I will die on it!\n\n### Optimization\n\nLast, but certainly not least, Optimization is an heteroclite family of\nalgorithms, that given a problem, will output (sometimes approximately) the\nbest solution. What does that mean? The algorithm used by your GPS to find the\nbest way home is an optimization algorithm. The PageRank algorithm used by\nGoogle to find the best answer to your search question is an optimization\nalgorithm.\n\n### Not everything is a nail\n\nYou might have noticed that for some real-world problems, there are different\nalgorithms that could provide a solution. Let\u2019s say we want to program a robot\nto autonomously navigate a maze without knowing the layout of the maze. We\ncould use some optimization algorithms (map the maze and find the best way\nout), or ML (is this a wall or is this a corridor?), or RL (what\u2019s the next\nbest step given all the steps we have already taken and what I see in front of\nme). Each algorithm is a different tool, and not everything is a nail. Yes,\nyou could use a hammer on a screw, and you will probably succeed. But was it\nthe easiest and cheapest way to do it? Probably not.\n\n> When looking for AI experts and practitioners, look for breadth as well as\n> depth, because the world is a vast place, filled with an infinity of\n> fasteners! \ud83d\udd28 \ud83d\udd27 \ud83e\ude9b\n\n## How does AI do it?\n\nLet\u2019s recap. \u2615.\n\nThe field of Artificial intelligence can be described by grouping algorithms\nper task. It can also be described using the mathematical tools used by the\nalgorithms to derive their conclusion. Going back to the cake example, I could\ncook a cake in an oven, in a microwave, in a grill. Not every technique is the\nbest for the task, but it works!\n\nAnd you already know many AI tools! Deep Learning, Neural Networks, graphs,\nBayesian network, linear regression, transformers, tensors...\n\nWithout going into technical details for each of them, all of them are a way\nto conceive the world mathematically. Each algorithm has a framework, a way of\n\u201cseeing\u201d the world. In the Apriori algorithm, mythically used to derive that\nbeer and diapers have a lot in common, the world begins and ends with two\nthings: the sets (the receipts), and the items in each set (the goods\npurchased in each receipt). From this abstraction, the apriori algorithm\napplies its rules, and calculates the most pertinent association of items. A\nsimilar result could be achieved with a different algorithm, which represents\nthis problem in a totally different way (e.g., with a bipartite graph).\n\nAn AI is always limited by the framework (the mathematical or statistical\ntool) it uses. It cannot see beyond it. It cannot go beyond it. But a problem\n(a task) can be represented in many different ways, and thus be solved in many\ndifferent ways, some better (accuracy, efficiency, etc.) than others.\n\n> On a side note, thinking about how problem A is actually problem B if you\n> change its framework (such that we can use an algorithm that we know work\n> well on problem B) is called Reduction. It is a fascinating branch of\n> computational complexity theory. It\u2019s not always about what an algorithm can\n> do, but also if it can do it in a reasonable amount of time (usually before\n> the cooling of the universe \ud83e\udd76).\n>\n> It is the living embodiment of \u201cthinking outside the \ud83d\udce6\u201d.\n\n## Where can AI do it?\n\nYou made it this far, and good news, it\u2019s only the easy stuff left to talk\nabout! \ud83d\ude07 AI or algorithms can be applied to anything. Let\u2019s look at some\napplication fields which you probably have encountered:\n\n  * Computer Vision: Algorithms for image recognition, like the ones who detect faces on pictures.\n  * Natural Language Processing (NLP): Algorithms for text/speech recognition, like \u201cHey Siri\u201d. It also includes summarizing text, sentiment analysis, topic detection.\n  * Autonomous robots: Algorithms for robotic automation, including self-driving cars, or delivery robots.\n  * Recommendation systems: Netflix, your social network feeds, Amazon recommending products. Those are everywhere.\n  * Search: Google Search, Bing.\n  * Data Science: I am carefully putting Data Science as a domain of application. It is not a task nor a tool, but rather an industry term to describe data analysis and applied Machine Learning or Data Mining.\n  * FinTech: Algorithms have been used for a very long time in finance, and the improvement in hardware and software has unleashed a whole new area where \u201cquants\u201d are replaced by data scientists.\n  * EdTech: DuoLingo, Khan Academy, Knewton have all developed algorithms for teaching.\n\nPick a field, and there is someone, somewhere, using AI. We can use AI\noptimizations to fold protein and discover new medicine, advance data\nprocessing in physics, or (try to) improve healthcare.\n\n# Where does AI go from there?\n\nI have been careful not to mention GenerativeAI (genAI) so far \ud83d\ude07. Where does\ngenAI fit in my nomenclature of tasks/tools/applications? GenAI is the family\nof algorithms that can generate things (y) given an input (often a prompt, x),\nso it is a task. If I ask a genAI algorithm to generate a picture of a muffin,\nit needs to \u201cknow\u201d what is a muffin. In its dataset, there needs to be\npictures of a muffin, labeled as \ud83e\uddc1. In that sense, genAI coalesces all the\nother algorithm families into one big ensemble of algorithms.\n\nGenerative AI is where (most of) the field of Artificial Intelligence is\ngoing, transcending its parts into a great complex machine. A machine\nnonetheless.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
