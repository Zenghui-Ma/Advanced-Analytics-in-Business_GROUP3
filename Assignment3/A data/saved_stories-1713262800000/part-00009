To\n> enhance its productivity, we propose a ResearchAgent, a large language\n> model-powered research idea writing agent, which automatically generates\n> problems, methods, and experiment designs while iteratively refining them\n> based on scientific literature. Specifically, starting with a core paper as\n> the primary focus to generate ideas, our ResearchAgent is augmented not only\n> with relevant publications through connecting information over an academic\n> graph but also entities retrieved from an entity-centric knowledge store\n> based on their underlying concepts, mined and shared across numerous papers.\n> In addition, mirroring the human approach to iteratively improving ideas\n> with peer discussions, we leverage multiple ReviewingAgents that provide\n> reviews and feedback iteratively. Further, they are instantiated with human\n> preference-aligned large language models whose criteria for evaluation are\n> derived from actual human judgments. We experimentally validate our\n> ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines,\n> showcasing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid research\n> ideas based on human and model-based evaluation results.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.07738 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.07738v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07738arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jinheon Baek [view email] [v1] Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:36:29 UTC (7,918 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled ResearchAgent: Iterative Research Idea\nGeneration over Scientific Literature with Large Language Models, by Jinheon\nBaek and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
