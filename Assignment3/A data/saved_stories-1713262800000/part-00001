As you may have seen, I was out sick with Covid for a\nmonth after getting home from our annual Council face-to-face meeting. It\u2019s\nnot been fun \u2014 some respiratory symptoms, but primarily, overwhelming fatigue.\nSomewhat ironically, the timing suggests that I managed to avoid catching\nanything at FOSDEM itself (where I wore a mask most of the time), or at the\nCouncil meeting, but rather on the plane or in the airport on the way back.\nAlthough emergency measures have been lifted, there really is still a pandemic\ngoing on. Be careful, everyone, especially when traveling! In any case, I\u2019m\nback to myself now, and am excited for Fedora\u2019s next big steps.\n\n# The Story so Far\n\nSo! I\u2019ve been talking about \u201cStrategy 2028\u201d for a while \u2014 we started this\neffort seriously about a year ago. If you\u2019re just joining in, or want a\nrefresher, Fedora Strategy 2028: a topic index for our planning process is a\ngreat place to start. I won\u2019t rehash all of that here.\n\nThe important thing is: 2023 was kind of a hard year, and although we made\nsome progress, we lost momentum. The Council hackfest helped get things back\non track, and we\u2019re moving forward now. We\u2019re not making any fundamental\nchanges, but we are restructuring how we present things \u2014 and we\u2019re moving on\nfrom theory to practical work.\n\n# A New Presentation\n\nOver the last year, we got feedback from many people who felt that the\norganization into Themes and Focus Areas was overwhelming and confusing. It\nfelt really big, maybe too much, and hard to know where one might fit in.\n\nAfter some discussion, we decided that we could better present our various\nobjectives as they align with something we\u2019re all already very familiar with:\nFedora\u2019s \u201cfour foundations\u201d: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First. The\nobjectives we\u2019ve talked about over the past year aren\u2019t going away, but this\ngives us an easier way to organize and prioritize them over the next few\nyears.\n\n# What Else?\n\nEven with a big and ambitious plan, we left some important ideas behind. For\nexample, we want to better tell our Fedora stories (both inside and outside\nthe project), and we want work to improve distribution security. We\u2019re not\nimmediately adding planned effort on these, but our new framing around the\nFoundations gives us more room to add those things as needed.\n\nOur project has amazing, passionate people who have done amazing things for\nFedora and for the world of community-built, free and open source software in\ngeneral. We should do more to celebrate them, to give everyone the recognition\nthey deserve. We should show new and potential contributors the incredible\nthings we\u2019ve done and the exciting things we\u2019re doing \u2014 and what it means to\nbe part of our community.\n\nThe recent xz exploit relied on long-term, persistent social engineering\nwithin an open source project, along with a very sophisticated technical\nattack. A long discussion on the devel mailing list shows that we have many\nideas for how we can make Fedora more resilient against such attacks as a\nproject, and Fedora Linux safer as an operating system. Initiatives to work on\nthese improvements may end up under a different umbrella, but will certainly\nhave some interconnection.\n\nAs we go through the next five years, don\u2019t be surprised to see us add\nCommunity Initiatives focused on these things \u2014 and others, as they emerge.\n\n# And then, there\u2019s AI\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard a lot about various \u201clarge language model\u201d chatbots, and about\nimage and even video creation. There is obviously a lot of hype around AI \u2014\nand inevitably, over-the-top nonsense. We\u2019re not really \u201cjust five years away\u201d\nfrom actual generalized Artificial Intelligence. This isn\u2019t the start of\nSkynet from The Terminator movies. Human creativity isn\u2019t being replaced, and\nI don\u2019t think all programmers will end up as \u201cprompt engineers\u201d.\n\nHowever, there is something real here.\n\nAdvances in accelerated hardware and machine-learning software have unlocked\npossibilities which were imagined last century, but which were not practical\nat the time. When the dust settles around the hyperbole, I believe we\u2019ll still\nbe left with something significant, powerful.\n\nIn addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and code generation,\nthese advances have brought big jumps for more tailored tasks: for\ntranslation, file search, home automation, and especially for accessibility\n(already a key part of our strategy). For example, open source speech\nsynthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now, what we have in\nFedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and flexibility of AI-\ngenerated speech.\n\nRight now, most of all this is proprietary. It\u2019s corporate-owned closed models\ntrained with hidden data, largely running on hardware without open source\ndrivers. If we ignore this, we\u2019re going to be left behind \u2014 not just Fedora,\nbut free and open source software entirely. On the other hand, we can take a\nleadership position, and build a future where AI belongs to all of us.\n\nThe Guiding Star for Strategy 2028 is about growing our contributor base. We\ncan make Fedora Linux the best community platform for AI, and in doing so,\nopen a new frontier of contribution and community potential.\n\nThis won\u2019t be easy. We have a lot of basic work on platform fundamentals.\nThat\u2019s drivers and tooling, packages and containers, and even new ways of\ndistributing Fedora software. We also need to improve developer experience \u2014\nfor example, it\u2019d be nice to have Podman Desktop as part of Fedora, with easy\npaths to getting started.\n\nWe can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could help\nwith package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies in test\nresults and logs, maybe even help identify potential security issues. We can\nalso create infrastructure-level features for our users. For example, package\nupdate descriptions aren\u2019t usually very meaningful. We could automatically\ngenerate concise summaries of what\u2019s new in each system update \u2014 not just for\neach package, but highlighting what\u2019s important in the whole set, including\nupstream change information as well.\n\nAt the same time, we need to work with the rest of the free and open source\nworld to create labels for AI technology which aligns with our values. We need\npolices on what we allow, and on what we encourage. We may even need to fight\nfor legal frameworks friendly to community-built software.\n\nFinally, of course, we can provide models in the OS. This includes\naccessibility tooling, which can benefit everyone: imagine an all-local voice\nassistant that doesn\u2019t send your conversations to some big datacenter or try\nto sell you things while simultaneously selling your personal data. We could\nalso include tools that make it easier to find help, features to simplify\nsystem administration tasks, and interfaces to better organize your documents\nand media \u2014 all within your control, all running on a free and open source\nsoftware stack.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started here (with, for example, Pytorch coming in Fedora\nLinux 40 1, CPU-only \u2014 for now). There will be more exciting things coming\nsoon.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nThe next post will be the high-level view of Strategy 2028, updated from this\nnew perspective.\n\nThe Council\u2019s next immediate step is to identify Executive Sponsors and\nleaders for each Focus Area under the broad umbrellas of our Four Foundations.\nThen, we\u2019ll plan and schedule concrete outputs and practical activities in\neach area. For larger efforts, we expect to launch Community Initiatives, but\nmuch of the work will be organized as smaller projects under each focus area\nbanner. Expect more announcements soon as we build this out!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategories: Council, Fedora Project Community\n\nTags: Council Hackfest 2024, Fedora Council, Fedora Strategy 2028\n\n### About the Author\n\n#### Matthew Miller\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nFedora Code of Conduct\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Infra and RelEng Update \u2013 Week 15 2024\n  * Fedora DEI Team 2023 Q4: Appreciation Week and new members\n  * Fedora Strategy 2028: April 2024 Update\n  * Fedora Ops Architect Weekly\n  * 2024 Git Forge Evaluation\n\n### Recent Comments\n\n  * C\u0103t\u0103lin George Fe\u0219til\u0103 on Fedora Linux 39 development schedule\n  * Fedora's default license for content is now CC BY-SA 4.0 \u2013 Fedora Community Blog on Policy proposal: Update default content license to CC BY-SA 4.0\n  * Community Blog monthly update: March 2021 \u2013 Fedora Community Blog on Fedora is a community; Fedora Linux is our OS\n  * _david_ on Fedora is a community; Fedora Linux is our OS\n  * M\u00e1ir\u00edn Duffy on Outreachy \u2013 December 2020 round : Meet the interns!\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Fedora Community Blog\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\nLicense.\n\nTheme by Anders Noren \u2014 Up \u2191\n\n%d\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": false}
