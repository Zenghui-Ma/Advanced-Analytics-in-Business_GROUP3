One offers governance, security,\nand performance features that instance admins will find useful as their teams\nstart on and adopt Plane. Additionally, Active Cycles, importers, and other\ncool features for better project management are also included in Plane One.\n\nOur Community edition is great for self-managed instances with starter teams.\nAs your team adopts and grows on Plane, both instance admins and project leads\nneed a little extra to make your Plane instance secure, easy to govern,\nperformant, and increasingly useful. Plane One offers just that for a one-time\nfee instead of pushing you into a subscription commitment. You enjoy regular\nsecurity and performance updates, security and governance, and better project\nmanagement features for the life of the version you pay for.\n\nIt is $699 for the first 100 orders and the only fine print will be your love\nand compliments when we go live. There's one payment for one workspace on one\ndomain name for all updates until v2.0 and it's your choice to upgrade to v2.0\nfor a one-time payment or to stay on v1.xx.\n\nEach Plane One license gives you access to one self-hosted instance on one\ndomain name with one workspace. You can buy as many licenses as the number of\nworkspaces and domain names you need.\n\nPriority support on Discord and email is included. Advanced support,\nespecially with code-base changes will cost you a little more as will, tailor-\nmade implementation and set-up services.\n\n$100 off for the first pre-orders\n\nWith your consent, we use cookies to optimize performance and enable functions\non this site.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
