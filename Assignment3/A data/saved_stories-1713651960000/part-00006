Ribbiting Adventures is The Lone\nToad\u2019s mid-monthly newsletter that will dive deeper into solo RPGs with\ncreator interviews, in-depth dives into solo games and mechanics, and a look\nat Solo RPGs of the past.\n\nToday we are finding out why a buffalo needs a castle, as we take a look at\nthe first Solo Adventure ever created. Yes! Buffalo Castle is the first solo\nadventure (and Gamebook) ever published for a table-top roleplaying game.\n\nMaybe Buffalo Castle was the first single-player RPG ever made. Makes you\nthink.\n\nThanks for reading The Lone Toad - Croaker's RPG Newsletter!

Ken St. Andre had read a friend\u2019s D&D rulebook and vowed to create a\nmore accessible and cheaper version. At that time the first D&D boxset cost\n$10 USD, a lot of money for 1974.\n\nFirst self-published in 1975, a wider second edition was published later that\nyear. While similar to original D&D, many people felt Tunnels & Trolls had a\nsimpler ruleset that played better. Unfortunately, it never gained the\npopularity of D&D but Flying Buffalo, the publishing company, still makes new\neditions and other T&T material today.\n\nThe heart of the Tunnels & Trolls story is a designer who loved something he\nsaw and wanted to take a shot at making something different and better. As an\nindie game designer myself, I think that is awesome and it is great to see\nthat is what this hobby has been about since the very beginning.\n\nYou can grab the 1st Edition reprint here.\n\n###\n\nBuffalo Castle\n\nOriginally published in 1976, Buffalo Castle was written by Rick Loomis, the\nfounder of Flying Buffalo. The cool thing about Buffalo Castle is it may be\nthe first Solo-specific roleplaying game product and the first \u2018Gamebook\u2019, as\nit predates Fighting Fantasy books by about six years.\n\nSteve Jackson (yes the guy who did GURPS), reviewed Buffalo Castle in The\nSpace Gamer no. 9, back in 1976. Steve recognised Buffalo Castle as something\nspecial for people who aren\u2019t able to get into a gaming group. He explains\nBuffalo Castle as a flowchart where successful rolls and choices will get you\ninto the dungeon deeper, or end your life.\n\nSteve also noted the rough aspects of Buffalo Castle, such as typos and two\ndifferent 21B entries. These would be smoothed out in the many reprintings.\n\nThe interesting thing is while this may be the first Solo RPG product, Steve\nwas aware of the concept of Solo Roleplay and commented that Buffalo Castle is\ngreat for people who play RPGs solo.\n\nSteve Jackson\u2019s original review in Space Gamer No 09.\n\n##\n\nThe Adventure Setup\n\nLet\u2019s get stuck into Buffalo Castle. Warning, this will have some spoilers for\nthe adventure, so if you want to play it yourself before you read about it, go\nget the adventure and dive into it. I\u2019ll be here waiting...\n\nAlright, I got my froggy hands on the 10th printing of the game released in\n1980, so presumably, some of the issues Steve Jackson complained about have\nbeen fixed up. Interestingly in this edition, there is a 21B and a 21Ba but\nnot two 21Bs.\n\nLook at that stunning pink cover. If I had seen this in my local game store I\nwould have grabbed it! But like I wasn\u2019t born yet.\n\nAfter the front cover and credits page you get to a summary of what the game\nis. They recommend you have a copy of the Tunnel and Trolls rules (from Fly\nBuffalo of course), some D6s and LOTS of papers AND pencils. You never know\nwhen you need more pencils.\n\nThere is also commentary on this adventure and the 5th Edition of T&T. This\nmodule was made for the original T&T and if you are using 5th edition rules\n(the current at the time) you may find fighting monsters a breeze. They\nrecommend instead buffing monsters a bit to give it a challenge.\n\nI wonder why they didn\u2019t balance the adventure for the new edition but it\ncould be due to the difficulty of doing major edits in this era. It wasn\u2019t as\neasy as editing a PDF back then.\n\nThe next page is the instructions for this particular dungeon. Firstly it says\nthe dungeon is for anyone who doesn\u2019t have a dungeon master close by, doesn\u2019t\nwant others to know they play T&T (seriously), or people who live in Alaska.\nIt\u2019s a bit unusual but I get the sentiment as they are the same reasons I play\nSolo RPGs today, although I don\u2019t live in Alaska.\n\nNext are specific rules for the dungeon. Only 1st level fighters. I imagine\nthis is because magic users and other classes would allow players to shortcut\ncertain challenges and it would destroy the adventure logic.\n\nAnd it explains how navigating the adventure works. You\u2019ll enter a room and\nhave a few choices to make, if you make one you\u2019ll turn to a specific passage\n(say 21B) and then read and react to those. We all know it as the formula for\nStorybooks or Choose Your Own Adventures, but in 1976 this was groundbreaking.\n\nThen you are allowed to buy a special adventuring kit for 10 gp and it\nsuggests you buy what armour and weapons you can afford. No need for torches\nbecause the dungeon is already dimly lit (thank god!).\n\nFinally it just kinda points you at a large gloomy castle and says \u201cHey see\nthat, go there and good luck.\u201d\n\n##\n\nDungeon Delving\n\nThe first thing you need to know about Castle Buffalo is holy shit it is\nconfusing. You\u2019ll be thrown through teleporting doors, traps, and many door\nchoices. The first time I delved, I didn\u2019t map it, but I quickly found out\nthat was a mistake. I was disorientated and had no idea in my mind where my\ncharacter was.\n\nMapping can be difficult also. One of the first doors you can pick is a\nteleport door which will send you god knows where based on a random dice roll.\n\nPoof indeed. Seriously, where am I?\n\nThe contents of the Castle are varied and I\u2019d categorise it as a \u201cFun House\u201d\ndungeon, as in a dungeon created not to make sense in the Gygaxian Naturalism\nway (a dungeon design philosophy where dungeons are supposed to work in a way\nthat takes in account the natural environment and the motivations of the\ndenizens), but a dungeon created to have fun with whatever monsters seem cool.\n\nSome encounters examples are:\n\n  * A sleeping princess that you can murder (seriously)\n\n  * A random dude who wants to fight you for treasure. I guess you should fight him and get treasure.\n\n  * A whole bunch of buffalos (actually makes sense in the context of the game)\n\n  * And of course an evil wizard. There is always an evil wizard.\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you how to play your game, but I reckon murdering the\nsleeping princess ain\u2019t cool.\n\nThere are plenty of traps and plenty of treasure to keep you occupied, but\nwhat there isn\u2019t is an overarching story to drive your adventurer along. Your\ncharacter is just clearing out this castle because it is there.\n\nThe player is also required to roll wandering monster checks often, these\nmonsters range from the pathetic Killer Bee swarm (rating of 10) to the deadly\nGiant (rating of 80). This means each run through Buffalo Castle will be\nslightly different.\n\n##\n\nThe Art\n\nThe art is simple 70s RPG art that you\u2019d probably come to expect from the era.\nAnd. I. Love. It. I love this period because it just fits so well with the\n\u2018print this in your garage\u2019 feel of the game. There are some great pieces,\nwhich I\u2019ve put below. All the art is done by Liz Danforth including the cover,\nwhich I also deeply love.\n\nLiz Danforth is still out there making excellent Table Top art and her work is\nwell worth checking out.\n\nMy favourite is the orc-looking guy.\n\n##\n\nThe Verdict and What Can We Learn\n\nAll in all, Buffalo Castle is a groundbreaking design that has been eclipsed\nby more modern versions. I still had fun getting lost and dealing with traps.\nIt reminded me of Fighting Fantasy or some of the Alone Against series for\nCall of Cthulhu. As it should because it is the long-forgotten grandparent of\nthose games.\n\nStill, much can be learnt from this nearly 50-year-old game, and they are\nlessons a few other designers have already taken away.\n\n####\n\nSolo Modules as Teaching Tools\n\nThe moment you turn on any computer or video game, you\u2019ll have a tutorial that\nguides you through the simplest mechanics and gets you ready to play the main\ngame. You hardly see this in RPGs and I think it\u2019s one of the major barriers\nto entry for the hobby.\n\nGMs are expected to know every rule before they play a second of the game and\nmust also be competent enough with the rules to be able to teach players. It\ncan be really intimidating.\n\nA solution that is sometimes used (but not nearly enough) is a simple solo\nmodule as a teaching tool. You see this in the basic D&D Red Box and modern\nCall of Chthulu with their Alone Against series. Chaosium Inc. does this with\nseveral of their properties such as Runequest and Pendragon.\n\nI had a good time dying in this adventure.\n\n####\n\nSolo Storytelling is Hard\n\nSolo game design has a lot of challenges but one of the main ones is how to\ndesign a game that has a specific story plot without constraining the players\nto the point where they feel left without agency. Buffalo Castle did this by\nrequiring that only Level 1 Fighters enter the dungeon. Was that a good way of\ndoing it? Maybe if you were fine playing a fighter, not so much if you want to\ntry out a Magic User.\n\nI think that is why more modern Solo RPG designs like Ironsworn or Mythic put\na huge effort into giving players tools to create and mould their own stories,\nnot follow stories laid down for them.\n\nI\u2019m still convinced you can create Solo games with set stories, but it\nrequires a bit of work and you can never guarantee players won\u2019t go off the\nrails\n\n#\n\nConclusion\n\nAnd that is it for Buffalo Castle, the first Solo RPG thing ever published. If\nyou have the chance to dig into it, it\u2019s worth it and fun. My hat is off to\nthe Flying Buffalo team who created something groundbreaking nearly 50 years\nago.\n\n-\n\nWant to read more about old-school fantasy RPGs and art?
