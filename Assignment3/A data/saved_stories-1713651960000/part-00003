Explanations typically\nfocus on the region\u2019s colonial history, which created highly unequal land\nownership. The region never had a major program of land reform to forcibly\nredistribute farmland from landlords to tenants, as many countries in Asia\ndid. The other big industry, mining, tends to be highly concentrated as well;\nsome economists blame this on the region\u2019s colonial history as well.\n\nOthers argue that the problem is more recent. For example, Williamson (2015)\nwrites:\n\n> Compared with the rest of the world, inequality [in Latin America] was not\n> high in the century following 1492, and it was not even high in the post-\n> independence decades just prior [to] Latin America\u2019s belle \u00e9poque and start\n> with industrialization. It only became high during the commodity boom\n> 1870-1913, by the end of which it had joined the rich country unequal club\n> that included the US and the UK. Latin America only became relatively high\n> between 1913 and the 1970s when it missed the Great Egalitarian Leveling\n> which took place almost everywhere else. That Latin American inequality has\n> its roots in its colonial past is a myth.\n\nOne possibility is that global economic geography forced Latin America into\nbecoming a commodity exporter instead of a manufacturing nation. Because the\nregion has so much farmland and so many valuable minerals, and because it\u2019s\nrelatively sparsely populated and far from the world\u2019s main industrial\nclusters in Asia and Europe, developing manufacturing was hard. Only a couple\nof Latin American countries \u2014 Mexico and El Salvador \u2014 have managed to\nspecialize in manufacturing. This could have limited the scope for\ninstitutions like unions and labor laws to equalize the distribution of\nincome, as well as robbing Latin American governments of the incentive to\nimprove education (which would raise human capital and middle-class wages).\n\nBut in any case, there\u2019s another very important fact that everyone should know\nabout Latin American inequality: It\u2019s falling.\n\nThere are a bunch of different ways of measuring economic inequality \u2014 the\nGini index, income shares, wealth shares, and so on. But as far as economists\ncan tell, all of these measures have been trending downward since around the\nturn of the century. Here\u2019s the income share of the top 10% of society in\nSouth America:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the graph for Central America, where the story is similar or even\nbetter:\n\n(Data for Venezuela isn\u2019t available.)\n\nThis hasn\u2019t solved the problem \u2014 the region is still more unequal than most\nothers \u2014 but it does represent pretty incredible progress. Importantly, the\npandemic doesn\u2019t seem to have interrupted the trend.\n\nSo what happened? The most common explanation is also the simplest: Latin\nAmerican countries elected center-left leaders who redistributed more income\nand implemented other policies like minimum wages. For example, Morten N.\nSt\u00f8stad has a thread where he lists the countries that reduced inequality the\nmost from 2005 to 2020 \u2014 four out of five are in Latin America \u2014 and argues\nthat progressive policy is the cause. For example, here are his explanations\nfor Uruguay and Ecuador:\n\nThis makes for a nice, simple story: Elect center-left governments, and they\nwill redistribute more, and then your country will be more equal. Electing\nfar-left governments is more of a gamble \u2014 Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales and\nNicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega brought inequality down, but Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez\nand Nicol\u00e1s Maduro destroyed their country\u2019s economy utterly. So sticking with\ncenter-left types like Brazil\u2019s or Chile\u2019s Boric seems like a better idea. In\nfact, Latin America has generally been in a mood to elect center-left\ngovernments recently.\n\nBut when economists look deeply into the causes of Latin America\u2019s declining\ninequality, they find that the true story is more complex. Although it\u2019s a\ndecade out of date at this point, Lustig, L\u00f3pez-Calva, and Ortiz-Juarez (2016)\nis still the most comprehensive, detailed paper I\u2019ve found on the topic. It\nneeds an update, but it\u2019s definitely a paper you should know. Lustig also has\na good set of slides that describe the paper\u2019s findings.\n\nLustig and her coauthors note that the decline in inequality across the region\nseems to have little correlation with what type of party the countries elected\n\u2014 inequality fell in countries that elected conservative governments too.\nInterestingly, Mexico and El Salvador, whose main exports are manufactured\ngoods, saw inequality fall just as much as in their resource-exporting\nneighbors.\n\nWhat about progressive transfers? The authors find that although increased\nredistribution does account for maybe 17% of the drop in inequality from 2000\nto 2012, the biggest factor by far was a reduction in pretax wage inequality,\nexplaining 62% of the decline. In other words, the poor and middle class\nstarted earning more money in Latin America in 2000-2012.\n\nWhy did that happen? Lustig et al. examine a number of studies that try to\nfigure out the cause of declining wage inequality in various Latin American\ncountries over this period. The progressive state does get a bit of the\ncredit, since some Latin American countries raised minimum wage, and a few\nboosted the power of labor unions. But inequality also fell in countries that\ndidn\u2019t do these things.\n\nWhat did affect pretty much every country in the region, however, were two\nthings: 1) faster economic growth, and 2) increased education.\n\nLustig et al. estimate that from 2000 to 2012, faster economic growth was\nresponsible for the lion\u2019s share of the growth in the Latin American middle\nclass, and for a majority of poverty reduction as well. This wasn\u2019t true in\nall countries, though; in some, redistribution mattered more. Here are a\ncouple of graphs from Lustig\u2019s slides:\n\nSource: Lustig (2017)\n\nSource: Lustig (2017)\n\nBut why was this growth so broad-based? Why were the benefits shared so\nequitably, instead of mostly flowing to the top 10%? Lustig et al., and most\nof the other studies they cite \u2014 as well as some they don\u2019t cite \u2014 suggest\nthat the key factor was education. In the 90s and 00s, Latin America made big\nstrides in school completion at both the secondary and tertiary levels. Pretty\nmuch every country got a lot better-educated:\n\nEducation allows workers to take a bigger slice of the pie. It increases their\nproductivity, making them worth more to employers. And it also probably\nincreases their bargaining power, since it makes them better able to\nunderstand their true worth as employees, savvier about switching jobs, and so\non.\n\nBetter education boosts growth, especially in countries like Latin America\nwhere education had traditionally lagged. And it boosts growth in an equitable\nway, because when a larger chunk of the population is educated, the \u201cskill\npremium\u201d falls \u2014 you don\u2019t just have a few elite workers taking all the cash,\nbecause they\u2019re suddenly in direct competition with a much larger educated\nworkforce.\n\nSo this is the likeliest story of Latin America\u2019s great inequality decline.\nThe region still has far to go, of course. And there\u2019s still the possibility\nthat the decline could reverse itself; Colombia in particular shows dangerous\nsigns of backsliding. But overall, the lesson is clear: Improve education,\nimprove growth, and do some progressive transfers, and inequality will fall.\nThe key isn\u2019t just to elect left-of-center leaders \u2014 you need left-of-center\nleaders who also care about growth and who pay special attention to the value\nof education.\n\nThe old adage about teaching a man to fish really seems to be true.\n\nShare\n\n101 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n12 Restacks\n\n101\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How Latin America started to beat inequality\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n38\n\nShare\n\n38 Comments\n\nBoogaloo7 hrs ago\u00b7edited 3 hrs agoYou should ask Argentina how well their\nsocialist policies have worked for them these past few decades. Frankly, I\nthink you can ascribe the dismal state of South America due to their pink-\nwave. South America is an example of how socialism destroys market forces,\nmeritocracy, and therefore wealth, happiness and freedom. Ultimately, it even\nincreases inequality, as people aren't owners of their own labour and capital\n--> it just means the government and people close to the government controls\nall the resources. Latin America is an example of where socialism leads.Expand\nfull commentLike (13)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies\n\nBob Smith5 hrs agoWhy this fetish for equality?
