Due to the rising demand for GPUs, the company\nwas ranked as the world's most profitable semiconductor chip brand for Q3\n2023. This designation translates to $18.12 billion in revenue and a $10.42\nbillion profit.\n\nAdmittedly, we're edging closer to a point where NVIDIA can't meet or satisfy\nthe alarmingly high demand for AI chips as more companies warm up and adopt\ngenerative AI.\n\nAs it happens, Microsoft and OpenAI have reportedly joined forces to build a\ndata center to support their high demand for chips, facilitate faster AI\nadvances and development, and reduce their overreliance on NVIDIA for chips.\n\nThe project could cost up to $100 billion and possibly be launched in 2028.\nIt'll also feature an AI-powered supercomputer, Stargate (via The\nInformation). The outlet also claims that Microsoft is working on a\nsupercomputer for OpenAI that's significantly smaller than the one highlighted\nabove and is slated to ship in 2026.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM windowscentral\n\n## What can we expect from Microsoft and OpenAI's new joint effort?\n\n(Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nWhile Microsoft and OpenAI haven't confirmed the claims, a Microsoft Spokesman\ndisclosed the company's heavy investment and future with AI when speaking to\nBusiness Insider by indicating:\n\n\"We are always planning for the next generation of infrastructure innovations\nneeded to continue pushing the frontier of AI capability.\"\n\nRELATED: Microsoft enters the chip game with its own Arm processors for AI and\ncomputing workloads\n\n## Get the Windows Central Newsletter\n\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nWith this in mind, it's clear that Microsoft isn't planning to back away from\nits AI-focused efforts anytime soon. The data center will help improve and\nsupport the companies' computational needs. As indicated by our sister site,\nTechRadar, the $100 billion invested in this project is enough to cover\nMicrosoft's expenses on servers and equipment for a whole year.\n\nAccording to a separate report by The Next Platform:\n\n\"The first thing to note about the rumored \"Stargate\" system that Microsoft is\nplanning to build to support the computational needs of its large language\nmodel partner, OpenAI, is that the people doing the talking \u2013 reportedly\nOpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman \u2013 are talking about a data center,\nnot a supercomputer. And that is because the data center \u2013 and perhaps\nmultiple data centers within a region with perhaps as many as 1 million XPU\ncomputational devices \u2013 will be the supercomputer.\"\n\nThe Stargate project will have more computing power compared to the existing\npower supplied by Microsoft to OpenAI from its data centers. While this sounds\nimpressive, reports indicate there won't be enough electricity to power AI\nadvances soon. Reaching such heights in computing will require more power.\n\nToday's best NVIDIA GPU deals\n\nMSI Ventus...MSI Ventus GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER Video Card RTX 4070 SUPER 12G\nVENTUS 2X OC\n\n$609.99\n\nView\n\nat Newegg\n\nASUS Dual GeForce...ASUS Dual GeForce RTXTM 4070 SUPER 12GB GDDR6X Graphics\nCard\n\n$609.99\n\nView\n\nat ASUS\n\nMSI GeForce RTX...MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12G Ventus 2X White OC\n\n$775.29\n\nView\n\nat Amazon\n\nMSI GeForce RTX...MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12G Gaming X Slim\n\n$803.42\n\nView\n\nat Amazon\n\nMSI GeForce RTX...MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12G Gaming X Slim White\n\n$869.53\n\nView\n\nat Amazon\n\nKevin Okemwa\n\nContributor\n\nKevin Okemwa is a seasoned tech journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya with lots\nof experience covering the latest trends and developments in the industry.\nWith a passion for innovation and a keen eye for detail, he has written for\nleading publications such as OnMSFT, MakeUseOf, and Windows Report, providing\ninsightful analysis and breaking news on everything revolving around the\nMicrosoft ecosystem.
