According to industry analyst Box Office Mojo, it\ngrossed a staggering $2.1 billion causing Disney to commission two spinoff\nmovies as well as the two sequels that were already planned. However, as the\nseries continued there was a disturbance in the force due an over-reliance on\ncomputer generated effects and a lack of the gritty quirky characters who made\nthe original movies smash hits.\n\nIn 2019, The Rise of Skywalker, the third instalment in the new trilogy,\nhauled in around half as much at the box office as The Force Awakens though\nthe series soon had a renaissance. Just a few weeks before the first case of\nCovid-19 was discovered in December 2019, Disney debuted its first Star Wars\nstreaming series, The Mandalorian.\n\nIt was a instant success thanks to the unlikely pairing of its protagonists.\nThe series is named after a gruff armor-clad bounty hunter, played by Pedro\nPascal, who is tasked with tracking down the family of a pointy-eared green\nalien called Grogu.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\n\n### Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\n\nBy\n\nKevin Payne\n\nContributor\n\n### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\nBy\n\nCassidy Horton\n\nContributor\n\nPhotos of the cute character went viral because of its resemblance to beloved\nStar Wars sage Yoda. The timing couldn't have been better as it thrust The\nMandalorian into the spotlight just as the world went into lockdown. Viewers\nwere stuck indoors for the majority of the following year leading to a surge\nin subscriptions to the Disney+ streaming platform.\n\nThe Mandalorian was watched more than any other show and, according to\nNielsen, it racked up 5.4 billion minutes of viewing time during its seven-\nweek run, peaking at 1.2 billion during the week its finale aired. It didn't\njust appeal to fans but critics too.\n\nAudiences awarded The Mandalorian a 92% rating on review aggregator Rotten\nTomatoes whilst critics went even further with a score of 93%. In fact, the\nindustry liked it so much that it was nominated for six Primetime Emmy Awards\nand forty-two Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, winning in 15 categories.\n\nThe Mandalorian has been a major success for Disney\n\nLucasfilm Ltd.\n\nUnsurprisingly it was renewed for two further seasons and even spawned its own\nspinoff series, The Book of Boba Fett, which premiered in December 2021. The\nonly reason that a fourth season of The Mandalorian hasn't gone into\nproduction is that a movie based on its two stars is due to be released in\n2026. It doesn't stop there.\n\nThe show's success spurred the development of a suite of new Star Wars\nproductions. Since it debuted, three other streaming shows have been released\nand three more movies are in development in addition to The Mandalorian and\nGrogu.\n\nThe declining interest in Disney's initial trilogy of movies seems like a\ndistant memory and the Mouse has made the most of it. Last month, Disney\nreleased a 67-page presentation singing the praises of its chief executive Bob\nIger in a bid to convince stockholders to side with him in a battle with\nactivist investors.\n\nOne of its key boasts was about the supposedly spellbinding return on\ninvestment generated by the franchises that Disney acquired under Iger.\n\nThe presentation gives the impression that Disney's Star Wars trilogy\ngenerated a 2.9 times return on the purchase of Lucasfilm as that figure is\npresented next to a timeline of key events in the production company's\nhistory. They include the release of the Disney movies and its acquisition of\nLucasfilm which is the only milestone marked with a star. Adding to this\nimpression is the fact that at the other end of the timeline is the Star Wars\nlogo and a photo of the Mandalorian with his little green friend.\n\nHowever, buried in the fine print is the revelation that the purchase price of\nLucasfilm isn't even included in the ROI calculation. Instead, it is purely\nbased on the box office performance of Disney's Star Wars trilogy, its two\nspinoff movies, merchandise, DVD and Blu Ray sales.\n\nAs revealed, the methodology is questionable as Disney based the ROI on the\nrevenue generated by the movies, merchandise, DVDs and Blu Rays rather than\nthe profit they made as it should have done. Using the revenue rather than the\nprofit artificially inflates the result as it doesn't factor in the costs that\nDisney had to pay out.\n\nEven this wasn't enough for the media giant so it also forecast the revenue\nthat it expected the Star Wars movies, merchandise, DVDs and Blu Rays to\ngenerate over a ten-year period and based the calculation on that too. In\nother words, Disney hasn't actually received the revenue that it used to\ncalculate the return on its investment.\n\nIn summary, despite seeming to do so, Disney's presentation doesn't actually\nreveal whether its Star Wars movies have covered the cost of its purchase of\nLucasfilm. There may be good reason for this.\n\nAnalysis of more than 800 pages of company filings has revealed that the cost\nof making Disney's five Star Wars movies hit a total of $2.1 billion, peaking\nat $567.3 million (\u00a3449.1 million) on The Force Awakens. However, that's just\nthe start.\n\nMindful of this blockbuster budget, Disney devised an ingenious way to make\nmoney back on the movie. Instead of shooting it in the United States, it chose\nPinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, where the original trilogy of films\nwas made. This enabled it to benefit from the UK government's Audio-Visual\nExpenditure Credit which gives studios a cash reimbursement of up to 25.5% of\nthe money they spend in the UK provided that it represents at least 10% of the\nfilm's total costs.\n\nAt the start of this year the UK government slightly raised the reimbursement\nceiling from 25% in the face of competition from other countries which are\noffering similar schemes. It has helped to make the UK a dream ticket for\nmovie makers and according to the British Film Institute, foreign studios\ncontributed around 77% of the $1.8 billion (\u00a31.4 billion) spent on making\nfilms in the country last year.\n\nWith so much at stake Disney didn't take any chances and got endorsement from\nthe UK government right from the start. In 2014 Treasury Secretary George\nOsborne proudly announced that Pinewood would not just be home to The Force\nAwakens but also its two sequels. \"This will mean more jobs and more\ninvestment,\" he said. \"It is great news for people working at Pinewood\nStudios, from the set designers to the carpenters.\"\n\nThe production also had an impact farther afield. Sets featuring the iconic\nMillennium Falcon and X-Wing space ships were built at a Royal Air Force base\nabout 55 miles west of London whilst the mountainous Lake District region in\nthe north of England was the setting for the planet Takodana, hiding place of\nthe sword-like Lightsaber weapon belonging to Hamill's Luke Skywalker\ncharacter.\n\nUsing local staff wasn't the only catch that came with the generous fiscal\nincentives. Movie budgets are usually a closely-guarded secret as studios tend\nto absorb the cost of individual pictures in their overall expenses and don't\nitemize how much they spent on each one. However, the costs of movies made in\nthe UK are consolidated in single companies which file annual financial\nstatements showing the cash reimbursement, headcount, salaries, total expenses\nand more.\n\nThe production companies usually have code names so that they don\u2019t raise\nattention when filing for permits to shoot off-site. The Disney subsidiary\nbehind The Force Awakens is named Foodles Production after the cafe next to\nthe San Rafael California headquarters of Kerner Optical, the original\npractical effects division of Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic VFX firm.\n\nA condition of receiving the cash reimbursement is that the companies must be\nresponsible for everything from pre-production to delivery of the movie and\npaying for services relating to the finished film. It is one of the reasons\nwhy Foodles is still booking costs on its financial statements more than eight\nyears after The Force Awakens was released.\n\nAnother reason is that the companies often file the financial statements\naround a year after the period they cover. This is why the latest results for\nFoodles were filed in December 2023 and are for the year-ending December 31,\n2022. During that period the company spent $3.5 million (\u00a32.8 million)\nbringing the total budget for The Force Awakens to a massive $567.3 million\n(\u00a3449.1 million).\n\nSurprisingly, this isn't more than Disney expected as the financial statements\nnoted that \"at the year end the estimated total cost was within budget.\"\nSalaries alone came to a total of $22.7 million (\u00a318 million) with staff\nnumbers peaking at 258 without even including freelancers and self-employed\nworkers who make up the majority of the crew.\n\nThen comes the cash reimbursement which was a whopping $92.2 million (\u00a373\nmillion) bringing the movie's net costs down to $475.1 million. As we revealed\nin Britain's Sunday Times newspaper last year, including the streaming shows,\nDisney has received more than $410 million (\u00a3325 million) in reimbursements\nfrom the UK government. No wonder Disney thanked Osborne in the credits of The\nForce Awakens and gave him several replica Lightsabers.\n\nThe second-biggest budget was for 2019's The Rise of Skywalker which cost\n$542.4 million (\u00a3429.4 million) to make. At the other end of the spectrum are\nthe two Star Wars spin-offs which were also made in the UK. Rogue One is a\nprequel to the first Star Wars film whilst Solo tells the origin story of\nFord's Han Solo character.\n\nSeveral of the Star Wars Disney+ streaming series were also made in the UK so\ntheir costs are known but, unlike the movies, their profit cannot be\ncalculated. This is because Disney+ subscribers pay a single fee which grants\nthem access to all of its content making it impossible to determine how much\nsubscription revenue is generated specific shows. In contrast, if they had\nbeen screened at the theater, viewers would have had to pay separately to\nwatch them all.\n\nTheater chains typically get around half of the takings with the remainder\ngoing to the studios. Deducting the $475.1 million net cost of The Force\nAwakens from Disney's share of the box office leaves a blockbuster profit of\n$559.6 million. This is 1.2 times its net costs giving Disney a 1.2 times\nreturn on its investment.\n\nIts 2017 sequel The Last Jedi had a multiple of 1.1 times, as did the 2016\nspin-off movie Rogue One. However, as the graph below shows, its net profit in\nDollar terms was half as much as the amount made by The Force Awakens.\n\nThe profits of Disney's Star Wars movies\n\nCaroline Reid using Flourish\n\nDisney spent a total of $298.7 million (\u00a3236.5 million) making Rogue One which\nwas a tremendous gamble as it largely featured little-known actors. Although\nit paid off with a healthy profit it could have made even more as the filings\nfor the movie state that \"the final cost was higher than the agreed budget.\"\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Solo: A Star Wars Story which is Disney's\nonly loss-making Star Wars movie. During production of the 2018 Han Solo\norigin picture, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were replaced with\nOscar-winner Ron Howard who reportedly carried out extensive reshoots causing\ncosts to skyrocket.\n\nThe impact of this is revealed in the financial statements for the production\ncompany behind Solo which say that \"the final cost was higher than the agreed\nbudget.\" A total of $350.4 million (\u00a3277.4 million) was spent on making the\nmovie which also got $63.2 million (\u00a350 million) of its costs reimbursed\nbringing its net spending to $287.2 million. However the movie bombed at the\nbox office as the takings came to just $392.9 million leaving Disney with an\nestimated loss of $90.7 million.\n\nAside from this loss, the accolade for the lowest profit and ROI multiple in\nDisney's Star Wars series goes to The Rise Of Skywalker even though the\nfinancial statements reveal that its costs were \"below the production budget.\"\nIts $112.4 million (\u00a389 million) bottom line brings the total net profits from\nDisney's five Star Wars movies to $1.2 billion which is $2.8 billion short of\nthe purchase price of Lucasfilm.\n\nBearing this in mind it's little surprise that Disney's presentation didn't\nwork out the return on its acquisition of Lucasfilm by using the profits of\nthe movies as it has still got a long way to go just to break even.\n\nOf course, the calculation above doesn't include the huge profits Disney makes\non the Star Wars merchandise, DVDs and Blu Rays. However, it also doesn't\ninclude the massive marketing costs of the movies as well as the costs of the\nStar Wars streaming shows and theme park attractions which also don't have\nrevenue streams directly connected to them as visitors get access to all of\nthe rides for the price of a single ticket.\n\nLikewise, the calculation doesn't include the results of the other Lucasfilm\nfranchises. As we recently revealed, Disney lost $134.2 million at the box\noffice on its latest Indiana Jones movie and Lucasfilm's streaming series\nbased on 1988 fantasy film Willow was canceled despite the Mouse pouring more\nthan $100 million into it. Lucasfilm also owns the Industrial Light & Magic\nvisual effects division though that is far smaller than its flagship\nfranchises.\n\nDisney made a loss on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny \u00a92023 Lucasfilm\nLtd. & TM. All Rights ... [+] Reserved.\n\nLucasfilm Ltd.\n\nThe Star Wars movies are the jewel in Lucasfilm's crown and generate the\nlion's share of the revenue which is of course why Disney highlighted them in\nthe timeline in its presentation. With several Star Wars movies in the\npipeline, Disney still has a chance to get its money back through their box\noffice profits. The films have rediscovered the magic formula to appeal to\nfans but aren't yet a force to be reckoned with for investors.\n\nCaroline Reid\n\nI specialize in reporting on the movie and theme park industries and have\n\n...\n\n  * Editorial Standards\n  * Print\n  * Reprints & Permissions\n\n", "frontpage": false}
