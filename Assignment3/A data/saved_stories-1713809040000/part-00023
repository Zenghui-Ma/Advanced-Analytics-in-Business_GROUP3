One example\nis Chaos (2005).\n\n## Chaos (2005)\n\nAction, Crime, Drama Director: Tony Giglio Stars: Jason Statham, Ryan\nPhillippe, Wesley Snipes Distributed by: Capitol Films, Lionsgate\n\n> Two cops, a rookie, and a grizzled vet, pursue an accomplished bank robber.\n> _\u2014Chaos (2005), IMDB\n\nCrime, Horror, Thriller Director: David DeFalco Stars: Kevin Gage, Sage\nStallone, Kelly K.C. Quann Distributed by: Dominion Entertainment, Dinsdale\nReleasing\n\n> Two girls, looking to score some ecstasy at a rave, follow a young man to a\n> house where terror awaits. There, a gang of felons captures and torment the\n> girls, drawing them into a nightmare of violence. _\u2014Chaos (2005), IMDB\n\nThe way Wikipedia disambiguates or distinguishes the two is by adding a\ndistributor of the film in with the release date:\n\n  * Chaos (2005 Capitol film)\n  * Chaos (2005 Dominion film)\n\nIncidentally, Wikipedia lists the Capitol film's release date as 2006, rather\nthan 2005, based on a German release date. Looking at the release dates for\nthis film, you can see that this movie has been released in '05, '06, '07, '08\n(in USA and UK) and '09, yet IMDB considers it a 2005 release because it was\nfirst released in 2005 in the UAE, which technically makes this fit your\ncriteria. Another piece of trivia: the Dominion film was first (August '05,\nversus Capitol's December '05).\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Aug 4, 2017 at 9:53\n\nGhoti and ChipsGhoti and Chips\n\n14.2k1010 gold badges8787 silver badges120120 bronze badges\n\n5\n\n  * 2\n\nSometimes it even happens that not only the title, but the exact same story is\nconceived to be released at the same time - one of the productions decides to\npostpone to not have a bad clash - for instance, search IMDB 'Jungle Book' The\nAndy Serkiss version was held to not fight the Disney remake. The Serkiss\nversion is supposed to be nothing like the Disney, & a lot closer to the book.\n[Planet of the Apes I guess filled his time between the two ;)\n\n\u2013 Tetsujin\n\nAug 4, 2017 at 19:51\n\n  * @Tetsujin Yes, there are many slight variations of this phenomenon.
