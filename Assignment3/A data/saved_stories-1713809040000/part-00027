Amid the tall grass sits a high-end audio\nrecording device with a small, almost cutesy rooftop placed above it.\n\nThe device, which is used to record the surrounding landscape, with a\nparticular interest in birds, might seem like an unlikely candidate for\nsomething that could provide insights into climate change\u2019s ecological impact\n\u2014 especially next to a steady stream of birds of a different sort: noisy\nhelicopters and planes going to and from U.S. Marine Corps Air Station\nFutenma.\n\nBut combined with devices at 22 other sites spread across Okinawa\u2019s main\nisland and backed by advancements in artificial intelligence, the recorder is\ngiving scientists at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology the data\nthey need to track how the species that call it home are being affected by\nclimate change.\n\nThe progression, causes and effects of climate change have been measured by\neverything from multimillion-dollar satellites to the humble thermometer, but\nincreasingly scientists are turning to sound to track warming\u2019s troubling\nroles in the biodiversity crisis and collapse of ecosystems.\n\nFrom Okinawa to Borneo to Australia, a growing number of \u201cpassive acoustic\nmonitoring\u201d projects are feeding scientists with data about changes to\necosystems and their biodiversity, broadening research beyond that targeted at\nindividual species. And as that data covers ever greater stretches of time and\nencompasses extreme weather events, the more it can tell us about the impact\nthat climate change is having.\n\n### If a bird calls\n\nPassive acoustic monitoring provides the foundation for soundscape ecology, or\necoacoustics, which quantifies soundscapes and investigates how they change\ndepending on the surrounding environment over time. With these increasingly\nhardy and long-lasting devices, scientists can now gather sonic data for\nlonger and across larger areas than they realistically could before, as well\nas in places that are inhospitable for field work.\n\nIn addition to climate change, the resulting information can also shed light\non the impacts of land-use change as well as the success of conservation and\nrewilding projects.\n\nA farm near an OKEON monitoring station in Ginowan, Okinawa Prefecture, on April 3 | Chris Russell\n\nIn the case of the devices in Okinawa, which are part of OIST\u2019s Okinawa\nEnvironmental Observation Network (OKEON), they enable the gathering of data\naround the clock from across the island, capturing everything from the heavily\nurbanized south through to parts of the relatively untouched stretches of\nforest in Yambaru National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. There are 24\nsites in total, and these also incorporate weather stations and insect and\ncamera traps (after an aviary was installed nearby, one of the stations became\nunusable for audio purposes).\n\nPeople have been recording animals and natural soundscapes for decades,\nfeeding into a variety of disciplines such as bioacoustics, but soundscape\necology has been galvanized by two things: agenda-setting papers in 2011 that\ntook key steps in mapping out the possibilities of the field, and advancements\nin technology that enable both the acquisition and processing of tremendous\namounts of data.\n\n\u201cThe field is moving insanely fast right now,\u201d says Nicholas Friedman, curator\nof ornithology at the Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity\nChange in Hamburg, Germany, who previously worked at OIST and added the\nacoustic monitoring to OKEON. \u201cI think it's really hitting its stride.\u201d\n\nThe fundamental building block of soundscape ecology is, naturally, the\nrecording devices, and these have seen significant shifts since 2007, becoming\nmore reliable, autonomous, affordable and smaller.\n\nThe OKEON project currently uses recording devices costing $900 each, although\nthose costing about $100 are now viable as well depending on the project. The\nmore expensive models can potentially operate out in the field for as long as\neight months.\n\nResearchers can program recording patterns \u2014 for OKEON, it is currently one\nminute every 30 minutes \u2014 and leave them to do their thing.\n\nCassondra George, a research assistant in the Environmental Science and Informatics Section at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, listens to a recording of a bird call captured using a parabolic microphone in Onna, Okinawa Prefecture, on April 4. Parabolic microphones are sometimes used to identify specific bird calls. | Chris Russell\n\nThe utility of these devices has been bolstered by improvements in somewhat\nprosaic tech such as batteries and SD cards, allowing scientists to record\nmore and for longer.\n\nThe more significant progress, however, lies with how the resulting data is\nprocessed, with machine learning allowing researchers to identify and group\nsounds in the recordings. The OIST team has used supervised machine-learning\ntools such as Wildlife Acoustics\u2019 Kaleidoscope Pro, which entails helping the\nsystem identify sounds correctly \u2014 at one point, one researcher had to\nmanually listen to about 100 hours of crows.\n\nBut even more advanced capabilities are coming online, such as \u201cconvolutional\nneural networks\u201d and \u201ctransfer learning,\u201d the latter being where a model used\nfor one task is reapplied to a related one. These, in turn, are helping\nresearchers process data faster and in greater detail.\n\n\u201cThat (supervised machine learning) is almost a fossil by now,\u201d says Samuel\nRoss, a postdoctoral scholar at OIST whose research focuses on ecological\nresilience and stability. \u201cThese deep learning approaches are really\nrevolutionizing how we think about the soundscape.\u201d\n\nThe Okinawa rail is among the species of birds the Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology has tracked through its island-wide recording network. | Patrick Kuhn\n\nWhile soundscape ecology touches on the technological sublime, it is\nfundamentally based on field work, with this playing a key role in not only\ncollecting data but also linking the analysis of the sounds with real-world\nobservations. On that front, the OIST team is now measuring forest canopy\ncover using a special camera strapped to a person\u2019s head, in order to better\ntie post-typhoon soundscapes to forest conditions.\n\nThe efforts of citizen scientists play a role too, with information uploaded\nto platforms such as eBird helping to identify birds, particularly recordings\nof their calls.\n\nThe OIST field work is also an altogether messier enterprise, bringing\nchallenges of its own. And for the insects that inhabit the Okinawan jungle,\nthe recorders are valued for a different reason.\n\n\u201cThere's like this nice, warm, dry box \u2014 suddenly, every ant and moth in the\nwhole forest decides it wants to live there,\u201d says Friedman. \u201cAnd so I would\nopen up these recorders, change the batteries, and there'd be an entire ants\nnest in there, and the thing would be just junked.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not as simple as sticking up some mics across a landscape.\n\n\u201cIt can be quite easy to misuse some of these methods,\u201d says Ross. \u201cYou do\nneed a kind of basic understanding of a little bit of sound physics, a little\nbit of engineering, a little bit of data science.\u201d\n\nSamuel Ross, a postdoctoral scholar at the Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology, at the OIST campus in Onna, Okinawa Prefecture, on April 4 | Chris Russell\n\nThen, there are other concerns around soundscape ecology, namely whether you\ncan identify a species\u2019 abundance from a recording, or whether the recordings\nreally reflect the biodiversity of the area. On both points, Ross concedes\nthat they don\u2019t really know or can\u2019t be sure, or it depends on the context.\nStill, advances in machine learning and other technologies may partially or\neven fully address those worries by helping to better identify species in\nrecordings and differentiating between sounds.\n\nAnd more to the point, scientists believe the recordings can usefully track\nchanges in biodiversity. That means they can tell us things about how\necological communities respond to extreme weather or climate change.\n\n\u201cIf you see a change in the community, or change in the number of species\npresent, or the diversity of those species, you are quite likely to get a\nchange in the soundscape,\u201d Ross says.\n\n### The sound of climate change\n\nThe OKEON project is designed to track the natural and human factors affecting\nOkinawa\u2019s main island, but climate change was not an explicit focus within\nthat. Still, it loomed in the background as an inescapable part of that\nanthropogenic influence, and as time has gone on the OIST researchers have\nbeen able to tackle issues related to it.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly now we have people who would consider themselves ecologists ...\nwho are interested in questions about climate, and we now are coming at this\nfrom a different angle, saying \u2018OK, well, we can use all these acoustics\nmethods as a tool to ask questions about climate change,\u2019\u201d Ross says.\n\n\u201cClimate change acts on quite a long time scale, and so increasingly as we get\nyear after year after year of this data coming in, we're more and more able to\nask questions that are of relevance to climate change.\u201d\n\nClimate change\u2019s relationship with biodiversity is twofold. On one hand,\nbiodiversity can help shore up the natural processes that absorb carbon.\nWhat\u2019s more, biodiverse places are more resilient \u2014 which helps maintain the\necosystems that humans depend on for everything from medicine to food.\n\nA Japanese white-eye. Scientists believe recording networks such as that of the Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology can usefully track changes in biodiversity. | Patrick Kuhn\n\nOn the other, while warming is not the main driver of biodiversity decline \u2014\nthat would be land use, particularly for food production \u2014 it has a role to\nplay by changing ecosystems.\n\n\u201cSmall places like Okinawa, island ecosystems, are also really fragile and\nsusceptible to climate change,\u201d says Friedman.\n\n\u201cFor the animals that are endemic to Okinawa, if climate change moves their\noptimal range to the north, they can't swim up to Amami Oshima,\u201d he adds,\nreferring to the Kagoshima Prefecture island northeast of Okinawa.\n\nThe OIST team has already begun to test the impact of extreme weather,\npublishing a paper in December last year, based on 13,000 hours of audio, on\nthe impact of super Typhoon Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey in 2018, with some\nsurprising results.\n\nContrary to expectations, the monitoring sites saw diverging responses, which\nin Ross\u2019 view suggests \u201cspatial insurance\u201d \u2014 where island-wide ecosystem\nhealth is maintained because differences between local sites cancel out as\nanimals emigrate from more sheltered sites to those worse affected by, in this\ncase, typhoons.\n\nCassondra George, a research assistant in the Environmental Science and Informatics Section at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, looks at a spectogram showing birds calls, at OIST in Onna, Okinawa Prefecture, on April 4. | Chris Russell\n\nAlthough climate change has not been linked to the severity or likelihood of\nTrami or Kong-rey, around the world, more intense and destructive storms are\noccurring more often due to warming. And warming is increasing the chance and\nintensity of other forms of extreme weather \u2014 events that the OIST team plans\nto incorporate into their work. Altogether, that means the observed resilience\nmight not hold.\n\nAway from instances of extreme weather, some of the best, most climate-\nrelevant data will be obtained after passive acoustic monitoring projects have\nbeen running for decades. At that point, Ross hopes that scientists will be\nable to say how changes in temperature and climate affect the soundscape, and\nthus biodiversity.\n\nBut with the world already having warmed roughly 1 degrees Celsius compared\nwith the preindustrial era \u2014 and having crossed the important 1.5 C threshold\nlast year by some measures \u2014 it is crucial for researchers to obtain the data\non soundscapes of different environments now, thereby enabling studies such as\nthe one on Trami and Kong-Rey.\n\n\u201cIf we want to use soundscape data to inform climate action and the urgency of\nclimate policy and so on, then we need these immediate baseline data,\u201d says\nRoss. \u201cThe most valuable datasets will be those that span 30, 40, 50 years,\nbut before then what we can do is we can compare to baseline.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense that people are saying, \u2018Oh no, we need to collect this\nbaseline data now, before things get worse.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn OKEON monitoring station (the white dot in the distance) at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Onna, Okinawa Prefecture, on April 4 | Chris Russell\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nOkinawa(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/okinawa), climate\nchange(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/climate-change),\nOIST(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/oist),\nanimals(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/animals),\nforests(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/forests),\ntech(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/tech),\nBIRDS(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/birds)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
