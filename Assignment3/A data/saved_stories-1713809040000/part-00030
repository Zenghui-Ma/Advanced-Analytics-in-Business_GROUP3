The exchange is just a few seconds long, but it does a great job\nintroducing the tension that I\u2019d like to discuss today.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson plays Ordell Robbie, a gun runner that\u2019s looking to smuggle\nin half a million dollars from Mexico. He\u2019s brash, driven by greed, and won\u2019t\ntake \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Any opportunity with a dollar sign on it, he rushes\nto take.\n\nBut of course, he happens to live with someone that\u2019s the complete opposite.\n\nHis roommate / not-quite-girlfriend is Melanie Ralston, and in almost every\nscene, she\u2019s holding a bong. She doesn\u2019t care about anything else but the TV\nshow she\u2019s watching and the quality of the weed she\u2019s smoking. As long as the\nbong is lit, all is well in the world.\n\nIn this scene, Ordell is getting ready to leave the house and scope out a\nventure. He\u2019s pumped and ready to go, only to see Melanie on the couch once\nagain to revisit her cylindrical friend. With a look of admonishment, he\nfurrows his eyebrows and says:\n\n\u201cYou smoke too much of that shit. That shit\u2019s gonna rob you of your ambition.\u201d\n\nYou then see Melanie, high as she always is with a smile on her face, who\nquips:\n\n\u201cNot if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.\u201d\n\nWhen I first heard this exchange, I just thought it was funny. But the fact\nthat I can still recall it means that there\u2019s something deeper about it that\u2019s\nstuck with me. And I\u2019ve since realized that it does a great job highlighting\nthe paradox of ambition.\n\nAmbition is a tricky thing because it\u2019s both empowering and pointless.\nEmpowering in the sense that it allows you to look for opportunities that\nactualize your potential (as embodied by Ordell), but pointless in the sense\nthat it prevents you being okay with what is (as embodied by Melanie).\nAmbition helps set your future self up for a better life, but comes at the\nexpense of enjoying that life today. This is what Schopenhauer meant when he\nsaid that one of the defining characteristics of humanity is our tendency to\nrestlessly strive.\n\nBut one of the reasons I love that exchange so much is because it adds another\ndimension to this conundrum.\n\nWhat if your ambition is to be okay with what is? Can you still call that\nambition, or is it something else entirely?\n\nTo be ambitious is to imply that \u201cyou\u2019re not there yet,\u201d however you want to\ndefine those four words. That the bar is set higher than where you are now,\nand that the gap between them is what you need to make up for through your\nambition.\n\nBut suppose there is no gap in your mind. That you\u2019re perfectly content with\nwhat you have, like Melanie and her daily bong rips. Has ambition ceased?\n\nI\u2019ve thought about this quite a bit, especially because I consider myself an\nambitious person. Not in the pursuit of status or recognition, but more so in\nthe actualization of what I\u2019m capable of. There\u2019s this feeling that I can\nalways be doing more, or that there\u2019s ways in which I can express myself\nbetter. The distance between the crudeness of words and the richness of\nexperience is ever-present, and I often find myself trying to bridge that\ndistance with each piece I publish.\n\nThis desire to do so is both the source of purposeful challenge and\nunnecessary doubt, which is why I\u2019ve thought about what it means to be\nperfectly okay with what is. While I initially thought that this would result\nin the elimination of ambition, I\u2019ve since realized that it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nHere\u2019s why: If you want a certain state to persist, you will no longer have an\nambition to accumulate, but rather an ambition to preserve. Being perfectly\ncontent with your current state means that you\u2019ll desire what you have now,\nand wherever there is desire, there is ambition.\n\nIn the case of Melanie, if you took away her weed and left her without a TV,\nshe would no longer be at peace. In fact, if you\u2019ve watched the film, you\u2019ll\nsee just how irritable she is when she\u2019s no longer within the comforts of her\nhome (which leads to some disastrous results). And while this character is an\nextreme example of this phenomenon at work, it scales to whatever our desired\nmindstates would be.\n\nIn my case, if I were to be perfectly content with my craft, then that\npresumes that I would have to keep writing at whatever level I\u2019m at now. Any\ndeviation from it would re-introduce feelings of discontent, given that I have\nan idea of what I imagine the best of myself is. And chances are, this kind of\nattachment to an ideal will introduce even greater suffering if I feel that\nI\u2019m straying from it.\n\nThis is why I find it concerning when people rail against ambition. While I\nunderstand the premise of the argument, the solution to simply \u201cbe okay with\nwhat is\u201d seems short-handed. You can be okay with what is, but for how long?\nFor that moment? Sure. For the entire day? Maybe. For your entire life? I\ndon\u2019t think so.\n\nI\u2019ve said this before, but ambition is critical to the development of a\nhealthy mind. Not only because it allows you to know who you truly are, but it\nalso acts as a gateway to humility. Since ambition is about the putting the\nbar ahead of you, you\u2019ll understand your shortcomings in a visceral way. This\nwill allow you to keep arrogance at arms\u2019 length, knowing damn well that your\nflaws are ever-present throughout the trek.\n\nThis is where we get ambition right. It\u2019s when we\u2019re driven from a point of\nself-awareness, understanding that we want to do the best we can with this\nmind and body we\u2019ve been gifted. While we can be appreciative of everything we\nhave, it\u2019s important that we acknowledge how we could better direct our\nthoughts to solving the problems we care about most.\n\nBut where ambition goes wrong, however, is when we thirst for the byproducts\nof that ambition. When the promotion becomes more important than the work,\nwhen the money is more desirable than the challenge, and so on. This is when\nyou\u2019ve commoditized your ambition, rather than using it as a gateway to\nknowing yourself. And when you\u2019ve swung too far to the rewards that exist\noutside of you, then it\u2019s a good time to reevaluate what it means to be\nambitious even when no one is looking.\n\n_______________\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, consider joining the More To That newsletter.
