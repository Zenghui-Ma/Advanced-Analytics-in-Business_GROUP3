Critics as well as dedicated users of the platform agree that Duolingo\nfalls short when it comes to acquiring genuine language fluency. Despite this,\nthere is also consensus that it is a good platform to start engaging with a\nsecondary or foreign language, acquire vocabulary, and gain familiarity. My\nown experience with the app supports this notion. While learning French and\nRussian, I accumulated an impressive vocabulary of around 2000 words in each\nlanguage. However, this did not translate into fluidity in thought composition\nor spontaneous articulation. Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that\nthis issue is not just unique to Duolingo. Many traditional language courses\nalso cannot promise to deliver fluency by the programme's conclusion. To gain\nmastery, learners inevitably and necessarily must continue to engage with the\nlanguage through multiple means, such as content consumption and discussions,\nover an extended period of time. Capitalising on this gap by designing a\nsoftware solution to bridge it could be a complimentary value proposition of\nimmense potential, particularly considering the market and user base Duolingo\nhas already explored and captured.\n\nThanks for reading primalkarma\u2019s Substack!

With a limited vocabulary of perhaps as few as 150\u2013200 words, they\nbegin to form sentences and are able to express themselves. Remarkably, they\nachieve this without memorising any grammar rules or syntax charts. Upon\ncloser inspection, it will be evident that children are continuously immersed\nin contextual environments, and their vocabulary accumulation happens through\nthe gradual internalisation of the relationships between objects and their\nfunctions. The context provided by the surrounding environment serves as an\nanchor for vocabulary accumulation and is one of the major factors that\nfacilitates articulation and achieving fluency. Yet conventional language\nlearning courses in general and Duolingo in particular often overlook this\naspect or skip context completely. Instead, they focus heavily on memorising\nrules and structures using spaced repetition of decontextualized exercises.\nThey value function over a deeper understanding of language in context. This\nis also, coincidentally, the most frequently claimed reason language learners\ngive for their lack of fluency after completing a Duolingo course. While\nvocabulary building is important, fluency requires learners to go beyond\nisolated words and sentences and practice language in a meaningful way,\nreplicating the contextual environment children experience. The importance of\ncontext is also highlighted by the fact that even training large language\nmodels (LLMs) in languages is extensively based on \u2018context\u2019 provided to them\nthrough the use of the mathematical value \u2018cosine similarity\u2019. However, the\nchallenge lies in modelling software that can effectively replicate these\ncontextual environments to facilitate seamless language learning.\n\n###\n\nWhat exactly are Articulation and Fluency? A Programming Analogy\n\nCoincidentally, and funnily enough, software design and articulation are very\nsimilar. In the object-oriented programming world, software design involves\norganising various classes of interacting entities as objects to simulate the\nstate and changes occurring in a dynamic system. Language, too, supplies\nvarious classes of words\u2014parts of speech\u2014for describing and communicating\nsituations and events in the external environment. Nouns designate objects,\nadjectives describe their properties, verbs and adverbs indicate their states,\nand other parts of speech like prepositions, articles, and conjunctions\nposition these objects within a hierarchical structure relative to one\nanother. Thus, a sentence is, in essence, like a function or a method that\ncaptures an event or a change in state resulting from interactions between\nthese linguistic objects. Vocabulary.com defines articulation as\n\n> \u201cthe act of expressing something in a coherent verbal form\"\n\nBut viewed from the perspective of this analogy, articulation is essentially\nthe simulation or modelling of interactions among objects in the virtual\nreality of imagination. The faster this modelling, the more fluid the\narticulation. Conversational fluency is achieved when one is articulate enough\nto instantly model an event or describe a state. Conventional language\nlearning, especially Duolingo, however, focuses on the functional aspects of\nlanguage, which is why, after a certain point, the learner reaches a plateau\nand accumulates vocabulary without making any further gains in articulation\nability. A course modelled using the object-oriented paradigm can thus be\nextremely beneficial to the learner because of the contextual environment it\nprovides. The context not only anchors the accumulated vocabulary, but it also\nserves as an implicit reference point, highlighting the role each word plays\nin the sentence structure. It is also significantly more efficient in terms of\ndesign, as it is now possible to construct a single knowledge graph (language\nlearning data) that can be used to teach any language from any other language.\n\n###\n\nThe Implementation - Easier Said Than Done:\n\nThe primary purpose of language, as is widely acknowledged, is to facilitate\ncommunication, and all languages use the exact same classes of words\u2014parts of\nspeech\u2014to achieve this in their own way. However, ironically, Duolingo, which\nis a software solution to teach languages, has different courses to teach\ndifferent languages in the way they are modelled. There is no single model.\nThis is ironic because, in software development, repetition is generally\nconsidered undesirable and inefficient. But Duolingo cannot avoid this\ninefficiency due to the fact that it takes a functional approach while\ndesigning its courses. But curating a language learning course from an object-\noriented paradigm may not be as easy as it sounds. An upper intermediate level\nof proficiency in any language requires familiarity with about 4000 odd words,\nand creating a context for every word, each with several forms of its own, is\na humanly impossible task. But with the emergence of LLMs and the processing\npower they can boast of, the task is no longer impossible. Neither is it\ndifficult; it is just a bit tricky and needs a little bit of conviction.\n\nnote: this is a three part essay on traditional language learning methodology.\nto follow:\n\npart 2: What Ails Duolingo: A Comprehensive Analysis of its Value Proposition\nCanvas part 3: Maya: The AI based Contextual Leap to Bridge the Gap\n\nThanks for reading primalkarma\u2019s Substack!
