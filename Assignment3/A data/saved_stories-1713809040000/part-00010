Mallory was an alumnus of Magdalene College at the\nUniversity of Cambridge, which maintains a collection of his personal\ncorrespondence, much of it between Mallory and his wife, Ruth. The college has\nnow digitized the entire collection for public access. The letters can be\naccessed and downloaded here.\n\n\u201cIt has been a real pleasure to work with these letters,\" said Magdalene\nCollege archivist Katy Green. \"Whether it\u2019s George\u2019s wife Ruth writing about\nhow she was posting him plum cakes and a grapefruit to the trenches (he said\nthe grapefruit wasn\u2019t ripe enough), or whether it\u2019s his poignant last letter\nwhere he says the chances of scaling Everest are '50 to 1 against us,' they\noffer a fascinating insight into the life of this famous Magdalene alumnus.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Mallory is the man credited with uttering the famous\nline \"because it's there\" in response to a question about why he would risk\nhis life repeatedly to summit Everest. An avid mountaineer, Mallory had\nalready been to the mountain twice before the 1924 expedition: once in 1921 as\npart of a reconnaissance expedition to produce the first accurate maps of the\nregion and again in 1922\u2014his first serious attempt to summit, although he was\nforced to turn back on all three attempts. A sudden avalanche killed seven\nSherpas on his third try, sparking accusations of poor judgement on Mallory's\npart.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nNatGeo expedition hunts for 1924 climber\u2019s body in Lost on Everest documentary\n\nUndeterred, Mallory was back in 1924 for the fated Everest expedition that\nwould claim his life at age 37. He aborted his first summit attempt, but on\nJune 4, he and Irvine left Advanced Base Camp (21,330 feet/6,500 meters). They\nreached Camp 5 on June 6, and Camp 6 the following day, before heading out for\nthe summit on June 8. Team member Noel Odell reported seeing the two men\nclimbing either the First or Second Step around 1 pm before they were\n\"enveloped in a cloud once more.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNobody ever saw Mallory and Irvine again, although their spent oxygen tanks\nwere found just below the First Step. Climbers also found Irvine's ice axe in\n1933. Mallory's body wasn't found until 1999, when an expedition partially\nsponsored by Nova and the BBC found the remains on the mountain's north face,\nat 26,760 feet (8,157 meters)\u2014just below where Irvine's axe had been found.\nThe name tags on the clothing read \"G. Leigh Mallory.\" Personal artifacts\nconfirmed the identity: an altimeter, a pocket knife, snow goggles, a letter,\nand a bill for climbing equipment from a London supplier. Irvine's body has\nyet to be found, despite the best efforts of a 2019 National Geographic\nexpedition, detailed in the riveting 2020 documentary Lost on Everest.\n\nEnlarge / Final page of letter from Ruth Mallory to George Mallory, March 3,\n1924.\n\nThe Master and Fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge\n\nThe collection makes for some fascinating reading; Mallory led an adventurous\nlife. Among the highlights of the Magdalene College collection is the final\nletter Mallory wrote to Ruth before attempting his fateful last summit\nattempt:\n\n> \u201cDarling I wish you the best I can\u2014that your anxiety will be at an end\n> before you get this\u2014with the best news. Which will also be the quickest. It\n> is 50 to 1 against us but we\u2019ll have a whack yet & do ourselves proud. Great\n> love to you. Ever your loving, George.\u201d\n\nThree of the letters were found in Mallory's jacket pocket 75 years after his\ndisappearance when his body was discovered, exceptionally well-preserved.\nOther letters detailed his experiences at the Battle of the Somme during World\nWar II; his first reconnaissance expedition to Everest; and the aforementioned\nsecond Everest expedition in which seven Sherpas were lost. On a lighter note\nare letters describing his adventures during a 1923 trip to the Prohibition\nEra US. (He would ask for milk at speakeasies and get whiskey served to him\nthrough a secret hatch.) There are also letters from Ruth\u2014including her only\nsurviving letter to Mallory during his Everest explorations\u2014and from Mallory's\nsister, Mary Brooke.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n27\n\nJennifer Ouellette Jennifer is a senior reporter at Ars Technica with a\nparticular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from\nphysics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV\nseries.
