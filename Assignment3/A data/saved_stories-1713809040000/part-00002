Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Today's AI may just be 'autocorrect on steroids' but it's made Linus\nTorvalds mellow out over Nvidia\n\nNews\n\nBy Dave James\n\npublished 3 days ago\n\nTorvalds and Hohndel talk AI at the recent Open Source Summit, where the\nformer thinks it's made Nvidia better, the latter thinks it's just\nautocorrect.\n\n(Image credit: Aalto Center for Entrepreneurship)\n\nLinus Torvalds, the notoriously grumpy man known for shouting at Windows,\nswearing at Nvidia, and as the creator of Linux, is surprisingly upbeat about\nthe rising hype around the current state of artificial intelligence. \"It's\nhilarious to watch,\" he notes in a keynote at the Open Source Summit (via\nZDNet) this week. \"Maybe I'll be replaced by an AI model!\"\n\nTorvalds is talking in a keynote \"conversation\" with his friend and other\nnoted open source luminary, Dirk Hohndel, and their discussion covers a host\nof different topics. Though of course it had to touch the current tech\nobsession de jour: AI.\n\n\"Let's wait 10 years and see where it actually goes before we make all these\ncrazy announcements,\" he says, which is probably the most sensible stance to\ntake in a world where people seem to be vacillating between either AI is the\nsaviour of mankind or it's going to irrevocably doom us all.\n\nHohndel, however, is less than complimentary about the current state of AI,\nmaking the point that he thinks most AI is just \"autocorrect on steroids.\"\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nTorvalds does at least see some positives, though. \"Nvidia has gotten better\nat talking to Linux kernel developers and working with Linux memory\nmanagement,\" he says, referencing the company's increasing reliance on Linux\nsystems running all those large language models efficiently. And anything that\ngets a positive comment from the generally rather anti-Nvidia Torvalds has got\nto be something, right?\n\nIt was over decade ago that he very publicly issued the immortal phrase:\n\"Nvidia, f*ck you!\" while looking down the lens of a camera during a talk in\nFinland and raising his middle finger. And that was after already calling it\n\"the single worst company we have ever dealt with.\"\n\nSo, maybe he's mellowing out?\n\n## PC Gamer Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nAI, explained\n\n(Image credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWhat is artificial general intelligence?: We dive into the lingo of AI and\nwhat the terms actually mean.\n\nSpecifically, Torvalds does also see a value in AI tools for the sort of\ndevelopment that has been the main focus of his professional life. He states\nthat he is \"looking forward to the tools actually to find bugs. We have a lot\nof tools, and we use them religiously, but making the tools smarter is not a\nbad thing.\n\n\"Using smarter tools is just the next inevitable step. We have tools that do\nkernel rewriting, with very complicated scripts, and pattern recognition. AI\ncan be a huge help here because some of these tools are very hard to use\nbecause you have to specify things at a low enough level.\"\n\nHonestly, this is probably the most even-handed I've heard Torvalds talk about\na subject that's traditionally been incredibly divisive, maybe ever. I'm\nalmost shook. Though he does also warn us all to be careful of \"AI BS\", but I\nthink that's a fair warning most of us can readily heed.\n\nDave James\n\nManaging Editor, Hardware\n\nDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the\nColecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!). He\nbuilt his first gaming PC at the tender age of 16, and finally finished bug-\nfixing the Cyrix-based system around a year later. When he dropped it out of\nthe window. He first started writing for Official PlayStation Magazine and\nXbox World many decades ago, then moved onto PC Format full-time, then PC\nGamer, TechRadar, and T3 among others. Now he's back, writing about the\nnightmarish graphics card market, CPUs with more cores than sense, gaming\nlaptops hotter than the sun, and SSDs more capacious than a Cybertruck.\n\nMore about hardware\n\nAn AI company has been generating porn with gamers' idle GPU time in exchange\nfor Fortnite skins and Roblox gift cards\n\nCherry Xtrfy K5V2 review\n\nLatest\n\nGalax's single-slot RTX 4060 Ti is out in the wild, though sadly it appears to\nbe a little tempestuous\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\nSee comments\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nAlmost 12 years after release, 7 Days to Die finally announces it's leaving\nearly access\n\n9 years on, one dedicated Witcher 3 YouTuber is still finding new secrets and\neaster eggs in CD Projekt's masterpiece\n\nMetroidvania around a microscopic world to save dogs everywhere in BioGun\n\nHere's a chaos co-op take on getting boxes off the shipping floor and out the\nfactory door\n\nSlash and shoot your way through a procedural bug hole in Ants Took My Eyeball\n\nFor $8, you can get 373 games, digital comics, and more in a new charity\nbundle for Palestinian relief\n\nToday's Wordle answer for Saturday, April 20\n\nA studio helmed by StarCraft 2's multiplayer lead wants to create an RTS\n'paradigm shift' with its unannounced game\n\nGame master Joel cuts an unprecedented deal with Helldivers 2 players: Pull\noff the 'Martale Gambit' and he'll liberate two planets for the price of one\n\nFallout show creators decided on their own to faithfully replicate the iconic\npower armor: 'Bethesda didn't know what we were doing'\n\nWorld of Warcraft boss says Microsoft is happy to 'let Blizzard be Blizzard,'\nbut I'm not sure that's entirely true\n\nLoad Comments\n\n  1. 1\n\nBest RAM for gaming in 2024: I've tested the best DDR4 and DDR5 RAM to find\nthe right kits for you\n\n  2. 2\n\nBest ultrawide monitor for gaming in 2024: the expansive panels I recommend\nfor PC gamers\n\n  3. 3\n\nBest wireless gaming keyboard in 2024\n\n  4. 4\n\nBest gaming laptops in 2024: I've had my pick of portable powerhouses and\nthese are the best\n\n  5. 5\n\nBest gaming chairs in 2024: the seats I'd suggest for any gamer\n\n  1. 1\n\nCherry Xtrfy K5V2 review\n\n  2. 2\n\nTeamgroup Z540 2TB NVMe SSD review\n\n  3. 3\n\nLogitech Playseat Challenge X review\n\n  4. 4\n\nChildren of the Sun review\n\n  5. 5\n\nMoza R5 Bundle + Performance Kit review\n\nPC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading\ndigital publisher.
