Source:\nSmartCompany\n\narticle-article-body\n\nToday, April 22 is Earth Day, and if you\u2019re reading this, we\u2019re probably on\nthe same page about the urgency of the climate crisis. It can be very easy to\nfeel like your news feed is dominated by a seemingly endless string of bad\nnews updates about how things are going from bad to worse \u2013 we know, it gets\nus too.\n\nThat said, one of the most important things you can do to fight the climate\ncrisis is to talk about it. So, we wanted to share three great good news\npoints grounded in cold, hard data that you can use to fuel a conversation\nwith anyone you know who needs some help coming over to the green side.\n\nThe global-scale positive news below is sourced from Our World In Data \u2013 a\nleading non-profit think tank based out of the University of Oxford, whose\nmission is to publish the world\u2019s research to make progress against the\nworld\u2019s largest problems.\n\n## 1\\. More people care about climate change than you think\n\nThis research by Hannah Ritchie at Our World In Data shows that the majority\nof people in every country support positive climate action, but this level of\nsupport is consistently underestimated by the public.\n\nWhat does the data say? People across the globe believe that climate change is\na serious threat to humanity and that humans are the cause.\n\nIn a 2024 paper published in Science Advances, a team of behavioural\nscientists surveyed 59,000 people across 63 countries. The results found that\n86% of people \u201cbelieved\u201d in climate change \u2013 measured as whether action was\nnecessary to avoid a global catastrophe, whether humans were causing climate\nchange, and whether it is a serious threat to humanity. Even in the country\nwith the lowest rates of agreement, 73% still agreed.\n\nSource: Our World in Data\n\nIn another paper published in Nature Climate Change, researchers found similar\nlevels of popular support for political action across 130,000 individuals\nsurveyed in 125 countries. About 89% of people want to see more political\naction, 86% think \u201cpeople in their country should try to fight global\nwarming\u201d, and 69% said they would be willing to contribute at least 1% of\ntheir income to tackling climate change. Support was strong across the world.\n\nSource: Our World in Data\n\nWhy does this matter? Governments and policymakers, at least in healthy\ndemocracies, will change policy if they have sufficient public support,\ncompanies will be swayed by consumer demand, and individuals are more likely\nto change behaviours if they think others are doing the same. A common\nargument against climate action at a policy level is that other countries\naren\u2019t stepping up to the plate \u2013 so understanding global levels of support\nare essential to kick us all into gear.\n\nWhere does this leave us? It means the debate is now squarely about the merits\nof different solutions, and not whether we should act. That\u2019s great news.\n\n## 2\\. The cleanest sources of energy are also the safest\n\nEnergy is critical to human progress and as the UN rightly says, \u201cenergy is\ncentral to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces\ntoday.\u201d But have you thought about how the energy transition intersects with\nyour health?\n\nMillions of people die prematurely every year as a direct result of air\npollution. The leading cause is burning fossil fuels and biomass \u2013 wood,\ncharcoal and dung. The second is accidents in the mining and extraction of\nfuels \u2013 coal, rare metals, oil, gas and uranium \u2013 as well as in infrastructure\nmaintenance and transport. The third is indirect through greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions, with fossil fuels being the primary source of GHGs and the primary\ndriver of climate change.\n\nThe good news here? The lowest-carbon energy sources are also the safest for\nour health. On both the health and climate fronts, rapidly shifting to\nrenewable energy is the best thing we can do.\n\nSource: Our World in Data\n\n## 3\\. Tech will fundamentally change the world within our lifetimes\n\nTech can fundamentally change the world in ways that we can\u2019t even conceive of\nuntil they happen, so it\u2019s exceptionally easy to underestimate how much the\nworld can and will change within our lifetimes.\n\nYour great-great ancestor could hardly have imagined having electric lights in\ntheir home or flushing toilets, let alone smartphones or wi-fi. The\nexponential rate of technological progress should give us a lot of hope that\nwe will be able to develop the solutions we need to keep tackling the problems\nwe face \u2013 so let\u2019s zoom out and put the pace of progress into perspective.\n\nThis graphic shows us humanity\u2019s progress from the first use of stone tools\n3.4 million years ago. Each dash in the spiral represents 200,000 years of\nhistory. Compare this to the fact that we went from the first steam engine\naround 1800, to the first plane in 1903, and from there to the first\nmultinational space station in 1998. The developments we will see in our\nlifetime will no doubt be similarly inconceivable from where we stand now. If\nthat\u2019s not fuel for hope, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nSource: Our World in Data\n\n\ud83c\udf31 In some more climate and nature news this week...\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa Albo announces the Future Made In Australia Act, as Australia\u2019s response to\nthe US Inflation Reduction Act. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced\nplans to revitalise Australia\u2019s manufacturing industry by producing more\nthings here using clean energy and resources, which will include targeted\nfinance for clean industries. While the details will be announced in the\ncoming weeks, the three key goals are supercharging clean industries, building\non existing progress toward renewable energy, and slashing climate pollution.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u2696\ufe0f A historic win for the planet as a group of 2,400 Swiss women in their 70s\nwon the first-ever climate law victory in the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe ECHR ruled that Switzerland\u2019s failure to address climate change violated\nits citizens\u2019 human rights, which paves the way for future plaintiffs to sue\ntheir governments for better climate protections \u2013 check out the details in\nthis article and this podcast episode.\n\n\ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f The world\u2019s largest offshore wind project to date has been approved, to\ndeliver up to 5.5 gigawatts of power in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish coast.\n\n\ud83e\udd69 The State of New York is suing the world\u2019s largest meat company for\nmisleading consumers about its climate commitments. This could be a tipping\npoint for greenwashing and have far-reaching implications, in how it may\nimpact how all kinds of big businesses approach their advertising on\nsustainability.

Illegal\ndeforestation, land grabbing and poaching hinder climate action and nature\nconservation around the world, but are notoriously difficult to track in\npractice. Governments, private companies and NGOs are now making progress\nthrough leveraging geospatial and predictive analytics to predict where\ncertain environmental crimes are most likely to take place.
