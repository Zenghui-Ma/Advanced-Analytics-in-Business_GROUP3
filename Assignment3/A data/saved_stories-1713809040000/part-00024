The number and variety of connected devices will rise exponentially in\nthe coming years. Cyberattacks represent a matter of public interest as they\nhave a critical impact not only on the Union\u2019s economy, but also on democracy,\nconsumer safety and health. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the\nUnion\u2019s approach to cybersecurity, address cyber resilience at Union level and\nimprove the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal\nframework for essential cybersecurity requirements for placing products with\ndigital elements on the Union market. Two major problems adding costs for\nusers and society should be addressed: a low level of cybersecurity of\nproducts with digital elements, reflected by widespread vulnerabilities and\nthe insufficient and inconsistent provision of security updates to address\nthem, and an insufficient understanding and access to information by users,\npreventing them from choosing products with adequate cybersecurity properties\nor using them in a secure manner.(2) This Regulation aims to set the boundary\nconditions for the development of secure products with digital elements by\nensuring that hardware and software products are placed on the market with\nfewer vulnerabilities and that manufacturers take security seriously\nthroughout a product\u2019s lifecycle. It also aims to create conditions allowing\nusers to take cybersecurity into account when selecting and using products\nwith digital elements, for example by improving transparency with regard to\nthe support period for products with digital elements made available on the\nmarket.(3) Relevant Union law in force comprises several sets of horizontal\nrules that address certain aspects linked to cybersecurity from different\nangles, including measures to improve the security of the digital supply\nchain. However, existing Union law related to cybersecurity, including\nRegulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4) and\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5),\ndoes not directly cover mandatory requirements for the security of products\nwith digital elements.(4) While existing Union law applies to certain products\nwith digital elements, there is no horizontal Union regulatory framework\nestablishing comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for all products with\ndigital elements. The various acts and initiatives taken thus far at Union and\nnational levels only partially address the identified cybersecurity-related\nproblems and risks, creating a legislative patchwork within the internal\nmarket, increasing legal uncertainty for both manufacturers and users of those\nproducts and adding an unnecessary burden on businesses and organisations to\ncomply with a number of requirements and obligations for similar types of\nproducts. The cybersecurity of those products has a particularly strong cross-\nborder dimension, as products with digital elements manufactured in one\ncountry are often used by organisations and consumers across the entire\ninternal market. This makes it necessary to regulate the field at Union level\nto ensure a harmonised regulatory framework and legal certainty for users,\norganisations and businesses, including microenterprises and small and medium-\nsized enterprises as defined in the Annex to Commission Recommendation\n2003/361/EC(6). The Union regulatory landscape should be harmonised by\nintroducing horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital\nelements.In addition, certainty for economic operators and users should be\nensured across the Union, as well as a better harmonisation of the internal\nmarket and proportionality for microenterprises and small and medium-sized\nenterprises, creating more viable conditions for economic operators aiming to\nenter that market.(5) As regards microenterprises and small and medium-sized\nenterprises as defined in the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC,\nwhen determining the category an enterprise falls into, the provisions of that\nAnnex should be applied in their entirety. Therefore, when calculating the\nstaff headcount and financial ceilings determining the enterprise categories,\nthe provisions of Article 6 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation\n2003/361/EC on establishing the data of an enterprise in consideration of\nspecific types of enterprises, such as partner enterprises or linked\nenterprises, should also be applied.(6) The Commission should provide guidance\nto assist economic operators, particularly microenterprises and small and\nmedium-sized enterprises, in the application of this Regulation. Such guidance\nshould cover, inter alia, the scope of this Regulation, in particular, remote\ndata processing and its implications for free and open-source software\ndevelopers, the application of the criteria used to determine support periods\nfor products with digital elements, the interplay between this Regulation and\nother Union law and what constitutes a substantial modification.(7) At Union\nlevel, various programmatic and political documents, such as the Joint\ncommunication of the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for\nForeign Affairs and Security Policy of 16 December 2020, entitled \u2018The EU\u2019s\nCybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade\u2019, the Council Conclusions of 2\nDecember 2020 on the cybersecurity of connected devices and of 23 May 2022 on\nthe development of the European Union's cyber posture and the European\nParliament resolution of 10 June 2021 on the EU\u2019s Cybersecurity Strategy for\nthe Digital Decade(7), have called for specific Union cybersecurity\nrequirements for products with digital elements, with several countries around\nthe world introducing measures to address this issue on their own initiative.\nIn the final report of the Conference on the Future of Europe, citizens called\nfor \u201ca stronger role for the EU in countering cybersecurity threats\u201d. In order\nfor the Union to play a leading international role in the field of\ncybersecurity, it is important to establish an ambitious regulatory\nframework.(8) To increase the overall level of cybersecurity of all products\nwith digital elements placed on the internal market, it is necessary to\nintroduce objective-oriented and technology-neutral essential cybersecurity\nrequirements for those products that apply horizontally.(9) Under certain\nconditions, all products with digital elements integrated in or connected to a\nlarger electronic information system can serve as an attack vector for\nmalicious actors. As a result, even hardware and software considered to be\nless critical can facilitate the initial compromise of a device or network,\nenabling malicious actors to gain privileged access to a system or to move\nlaterally across systems. Manufacturers should therefore ensure that all\nproducts with digital elements are designed and developed in accordance with\nthe essential requirements laid down in this Regulation. That obligation\nrelates to both products that can be connected physically via hardware\ninterfaces and products that are connected logically, such as via network\nsockets, pipes, files, application programming interfaces or any other types\nof software interface. As cyber threats can propagate through various products\nwith digital elements before reaching a certain target, for example by\nchaining together multiple vulnerability exploits, manufacturers should also\nensure the cybersecurity of products with digital elements that are only\nindirectly connected to other devices or networks.(10) By laying down\ncybersecurity requirements for placing on the market products with digital\nelements, it is intended that the cybersecurity of those products for\nconsumers and businesses alike be enhanced. Those requirements will also\nensure that cybersecurity is taken into account throughout supply chains,\nmaking final products with digital elements and their components more secure.\nThis also includes requirements for placing on the market consumer products\nwith digital elements intended for vulnerable consumers, such as toys and baby\nmonitoring systems. Consumer products with digital elements categorised in\nthis Regulation as important products with digital elements present a higher\ncybersecurity risk by performing a function which carries a significant risk\nof adverse effects in terms of its intensity and ability to damage the health,\nsecurity or safety of users of such products, and should undergo a stricter\nconformity assessment procedure. This applies to smart home products with\nsecurity functionalities, such as smart door locks, baby monitoring systems\nand alarm systems, connected toys and personal wearable health technology.\nFurthermore, the stricter conformity assessment procedures that other products\nwith digital elements categorised in this Regulation as important or critical\nproducts with digital elements are required to undergo, will contribute to\nprevent potential negative impacts on consumers of the exploitation of\nvulnerabilities.(11) The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level\nof cybersecurity of products with digital elements and their integrated remote\ndata processing solutions. Such remote data processing solutions should be\ndefined as data processing at a distance for which the software is designed\nand developed by or on behalf of the manufacturer of the product with digital\nelements concerned \u258c, the absence of which would prevent such a product with\ndigital elements from performing one of its functions. That approach ensures\nthat such products are adequately secured in their entirety by their\nmanufacturers, irrespective of whether data is processed or stored locally on\nthe user\u2019s device or remotely by the manufacturer. At the same time,\nprocessing or storage at a distance falls within the scope of this Regulation\nonly in so far as it is necessary for a product with digital elements to\nperform its functions. Such processing or storage at a distance includes the\nsituation where a mobile application requires access to an application\nprogramming interface or to a database provided by means of a service\ndeveloped by the manufacturer. In such a case, the service falls within the\nscope of this Regulation as a remote data processing solution.The requirements\nconcerning the remote data processing solutions falling within the scope of\nthis Regulation do therefore not entail technical, operational or\norganisational measures aiming to manage the risks posed to the security of a\nmanufacturer\u2019s network and information systems as a whole.(12) Cloud solutions\nconstitute remote data processing solutions within the meaning of this\nRegulation only if they meet the definition laid down in this Regulation. For\nexample, cloud enabled functionalities provided by a manufacturer of smart\nhome devices that enable users to control the device at a distance fall within\nthe scope of this Regulation. On the other hand, websites that do not support\nthe functionality of a product with digital elements, or cloud services\ndesigned and developed outside the responsibility of a manufacturer of a\nproduct with digital elements do not fall within the scope of this Regulation.\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555 applies to cloud computing services and cloud service\nmodels, such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) or\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Entities providing cloud computing\nservices in the Union which qualify as medium-sized enterprises under Article\n2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, or exceed the\nceilings for medium-sized enterprises provided for in paragraph 1 of that\nArticle, fall within the scope of that Directive.(13) In line with the\nobjective of this Regulation to remove obstacles to the free movement of\nproducts with digital elements, Member States should not impede, for the\nmatters covered by this Regulation, the making available on the market of\nproducts with digital elements which comply with this Regulation. Therefore,\nfor matters harmonised by this Regulation, Member States cannot impose\nadditional cybersecurity requirements for the making available on the market\nof products with digital elements. Any entity, public or private, can however\nestablish additional requirements to those laid down in this Regulation for\nthe procurement or use of products with digital elements for its specific\npurposes, and can therefore choose to use products with digital elements that\nmeet stricter or more specific cybersecurity requirements than those\napplicable for the making available on the market under this Regulation.\nWithout prejudice to Directives 2014/24/EU(8) and 2014/25/EU(9) of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council, when procuring products with digital\nelements, which must comply with the essential requirements laid down in this\nRegulation, including those relating to vulnerability handling, Member States\nshould ensure that such requirements are taken into consideration in the\nprocurement process and that the manufacturers\u2019 ability to effectively apply\ncybersecurity measures and manage cyber threats are also taken into\nconsideration. Furthermore, Directive (EU) 2022/2555 sets out cybersecurity\nrisk-management measures for essential and important entities referred to in\nArticle 3 of that Directive that could entail supply chain security measures\nthat require the use by such entities of products with digital elements\nmeeting stricter cybersecurity requirements than those laid down in this\nRegulation. In line with Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and its minimum\nharmonisation principle, Member States can therefore impose additional\ncybersecurity requirements for the use of ICT products by essential or\nimportant entities pursuant to that Directive in order to ensure a higher\nlevel of cybersecurity, provided that such requirements are consistent with\nMember States\u2019 obligations laid down in Union law. Matters not covered by this\nRegulation can include non-technical factors relating to products with digital\nelements and the manufacturers thereof. Member States can therefore lay down\nnational measures, including restrictions on products with digital elements or\nsuppliers of such products that take account of non-technical factors.\nNational measures relating to such factors must comply with Union law.(14)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to the Member States\u2019\nresponsibility for safeguarding national security, in compliance with Union\nlaw. Member States should be able to subject products with digital elements\nthat are used for national security or defence purposes to additional\nmeasures, provided that such measures are consistent with Member States\u2019\nobligations laid down in Union law.(15) This Regulation applies to economic\noperators only in relation to products with digital elements made available on\nthe market, hence supplied for distribution or use on the Union market in the\ncourse of a commercial activity. Supply in the course of a commercial activity\nmight be characterised not only by charging a price for a product with digital\nelements, but also by charging a price for technical support services where\nthis does not serve only the recuperation of actual costs, by an intention to\nmonetise, for instance by providing a software platform through which the\nmanufacturer monetises other services, by requiring as a condition for use the\nprocessing of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving\nthe security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, or by\naccepting donations exceeding the costs associated with the design,\ndevelopment and provision of a product with digital elements. Accepting\ndonations without the intention of making a profit should not be considered to\nbe a commercial activity.(16) Products with digital elements provided as part\nof the delivery of a service for which a fee is charged solely to recover the\nactual costs directly related to the operation of that service, such as may be\nthe case with certain products with digital elements provided by public\nadministration entities, should not be considered on those grounds alone to be\na commercial activity for the purposes of this Regulation. Furthermore,\nproducts with digital elements which are developed or modified by a public\nadministration entity exclusively for its own use should not be considered as\nbeing made available on the market within the meaning of this Regulation.(17)\nSoftware and data that are openly shared and where users can freely access,\nuse, modify and redistribute them or modified versions thereof, can contribute\nto research and innovation in the market. To foster the development and\ndeployment of free and open-source software, in particular by microenterprises\nand small and medium-sized enterprises, including start-ups, individuals, not-\nfor-profit organisations, and academic research organisations, the application\nof this Regulation to products with digital elements qualifying as free and\nopen-source software supplied for distribution or use in the course of a\ncommercial activity should take into account the nature of the different\ndevelopment models of software distributed and developed under free and open-\nsource software licences.(18) Free and open-source software is understood as\nsoftware the source code of which is openly shared and the licensing of which\nprovides for all rights to make it freely accessible, usable, modifiable and\nredistributable. Free and open-source software is developed, maintained and\ndistributed openly, including via online platforms. In relation to economic\noperators that fall within the scope of this Regulation, only free and open-\nsource software made available on the market, and therefore supplied for\ndistribution or use in the course of a commercial activity, should fall within\nthe scope of this Regulation. The mere circumstances under which the product\nwith digital elements has been developed, or how the development has been\nfinanced, should therefore not be taken into account when determining the\ncommercial or non-commercial nature of that activity. More specifically, for\nthe purposes of this Regulation and in relation to the economic operators that\nfall within its scope, to ensure that there is a clear distinction between the\ndevelopment and supply phases, the provision of products with digital elements\nqualifying as free and open-source software that are not monetised by their\nmanufacturers should not be considered a commercial activity.Furthermore, the\nsupply of products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source\nsoftware components intended for integration by other manufacturers into their\nown products with digital elements should only be considered as making\navailable on the market if the component is monetised by its original\nmanufacturer. For instance, the mere fact that an open-source software product\nwith digital elements receives financial support from manufacturers or that\nmanufacturers contribute to the development of such a product should not in\nitself determine that the activity is of commercial nature. In addition, the\nmere presence of regular releases should not in itself lead to the conclusion\nthat a product with digital elements is supplied in the course of a commercial\nactivity. Finally, for the purposes of this Regulation, the development of\nproducts with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software by\nnot-for-profit organisations should not be considered to be a commercial\nactivity provided that the organisation is set up in such a way that ensures\nthat all earnings after costs are used to achieve not-for-profit objectives.\nThis Regulation does not apply to natural or legal persons who contribute with\nsource code to products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-\nsource software that are not under their responsibility.(19) Taking into\naccount the importance for cybersecurity of many products with digital\nelements qualifying as free and open-source software that are published, but\nnot made available on the market within the meaning of this Regulation, legal\npersons who provide support on a sustained basis for the development of such\nproducts which are intended for commercial activities, and who play a main\nrole in ensuring the viability of those products (open-source software\nstewards), should be subject to a light-touch and tailor-made regulatory\nregime. Open-source software stewards include certain foundations as well as\nentities that develop and publish free and open-source software in a business\ncontext, such as not-for-profit entities developing free and open-source\nsoftware in a business context. The regulatory regime should take account of\ntheir specific nature and compatibility with the type of obligations imposed.\nIt should only cover products with digital elements qualifying as free and\nopen-source software that are ultimately intended for commercial activities,\nsuch as for integration into commercial services or into monetised products\nwith digital elements.For the purposes of the regulatory regime, an intention\nfor integration into monetised products with digital elements includes cases\nwhere manufacturers that integrate a component into their own products with\ndigital elements either contribute to the development of that component in a\nregular manner or provide regular financial assistance to ensure the\ncontinuity of a software product. The provision of sustained support to the\ndevelopment of a product with digital elements includes but is not limited to\nthe hosting and managing of software development collaboration platforms, the\nhosting of source code or software, the governing or managing of products with\ndigital elements qualifying as free and open-source software as well as the\nsteering of the development of such products. Given that the regulatory regime\ndoes not subject open-source software stewards to the same obligations as\nmanufacturers under this Regulation, they should not be permitted to affix the\nCE marking to the products with digital elements whose development they\nsupport.(20) The sole act of hosting products with digital elements on open\nrepositories, including through package managers or on collaboration\nplatforms, does not in itself constitute the making available on the market of\na product with digital elements. Providers of such services should only be\nconsidered distributors if they make such software available on the market and\nhence supply it for distribution or use on the Union market in the course of a\ncommercial activity.(21) In order to support and facilitate the due diligence\nof manufacturers that integrate free and open-source software components that\nare not subject to the essential requirements set out in this Regulation into\ntheir products with digital elements, the Commission should be able to\nestablish voluntary security attestation programmes, either by a delegated act\nsupplementing this Regulation or by requesting a European cybersecurity\ncertification scheme pursuant to Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 that\ntakes into account the specificities of the free and open-source software\ndevelopment models. The security attestation programmes should be conceived in\nsuch a way that not only natural or legal persons developing or contributing\nto the development of a product with digital elements qualifying as free and\nopen-source software can initiate or finance a security attestation but also\nthird parties, such as manufacturers that integrate such products into their\nown products with digital elements, users, or Union and national public\nadministrations.(22) In view of the public cybersecurity objectives of this\nRegulation and in order to improve the situational awareness of Member States\nas regards the Union\u2019s dependency on software components and in particular on\npotentially free and open-source software components, a dedicated\nadministrative cooperation group (ADCO) established by this Regulation should\nbe able to decide to jointly undertake a Union dependency assessment. Market\nsurveillance authorities should be able to request manufacturers of categories\nof products with digital elements established by ADCO to submit the software\nbills of materials (SBOMs) that they have generated pursuant to this\nRegulation. In order to protect the confidentiality of SBOMs, market\nsurveillance authorities should submit relevant information about dependencies\nto ADCO in an anonymised and aggregated manner.(23) The effectiveness of the\nimplementation of this Regulation will also depend on the availability of\nadequate cybersecurity skills. At Union level, various programmatic and\npolitical documents, including the Commission communication of 18 April 2023\non Closing the cybersecurity talent gap to boost the EU\u2019s competitiveness,\ngrowth and resilience and the Council Conclusions of 22 May 2023 on the EU\nPolicy on Cyber Defence acknowledged the cybersecurity skills gap in the Union\nand the need to address such challenges as a matter of priority, in both the\npublic and private sectors. With a view to ensuring an effective\nimplementation of this Regulation, Member States should ensure that adequate\nresources are available for the appropriate staffing of the market\nsurveillance authorities and conformity assessment bodies to perform their\ntasks laid down in this Regulation. Those measures should enhance workforce\nmobility in the cybersecurity field and their associated career pathways. They\nshould also contribute to making the cybersecurity workforce more resilient\nand inclusive, also in terms of gender. Member States should therefore take\nmeasures to ensure that those tasks are carried out by adequately trained\nprofessionals, with the necessary cybersecurity skills.Similarly,\nmanufacturers should ensure that their staff has the necessary skills to\ncomply with their obligations laid down in this Regulation. Member States and\nthe Commission, in line with their prerogatives and competences and the\nspecific tasks conferred upon them by this Regulation, should take measures to\nsupport manufacturers and in particular microenterprises and small and medium-\nsized enterprises, including start-ups, also in areas such as skill\ndevelopment, for the purposes of compliance with their obligations laid down\nin this Regulation. Furthermore, as Directive (EU) 2022/2555 requires Member\nStates to adopt policies promoting and developing training on cybersecurity\nand cybersecurity skills as part of their national cybersecurity strategies,\nMember States may consider, when adopting such strategies, to also address the\ncybersecurity skills needs resulting from this Regulation, including those\nrelating to re-skilling and up-skilling.(24) A secure internet is\nindispensable for the functioning of critical infrastructures and for society\nas a whole. \u258c Directive (EU) 2022/2555 aims at ensuring a high level of\ncybersecurity of services provided by essential and important entities\nreferred to in Article 3 of that Directive, including digital infrastructure\nproviders that support core functions of the open internet, ensure internet\naccess and internet services. It is therefore important that the products with\ndigital elements necessary for digital infrastructure providers to ensure the\nfunctioning of the internet are developed in a secure manner and that they\ncomply with well-established internet security standards. This Regulation,\nwhich applies to all connectable hardware and software products, also aims at\nfacilitating the compliance of digital infrastructure providers with the\nsupply chain requirements under \u258c Directive (EU) 2022/2555 by ensuring that\nthe products with digital elements that they use for the provision of their\nservices are developed in a secure manner and that they have access to timely\nsecurity updates for such products.(25) Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council(10) lays down rules on medical devices\nand Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council(11)\nlays down rules on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Those Regulations\naddress cybersecurity risks and follow particular approaches that are also\naddressed in this Regulation. More specifically, Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and\n(EU) 2017/746 lay down essential requirements for medical devices that\nfunction through an electronic system or that are software themselves. Certain\nnon-embedded software and the whole lifecycle approach are also covered by\nthose Regulations. Those requirements mandate manufacturers to develop and\nbuild their products by applying risk management principles and by setting out\nrequirements concerning IT security measures, as well as corresponding\nconformity assessment procedures. Furthermore, specific guidance on\ncybersecurity for medical devices is in place since December 2019, providing\nmanufacturers of medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic devices, with\nguidance on how to fulfil all the relevant essential requirements of Annex I\nto those Regulations with regard to cybersecurity. Products with digital\nelements to which either of those Regulations apply should therefore not be\nsubject to this Regulation.(26) Products with digital elements that are\ndeveloped or modified exclusively for national security or defence purposes or\nproducts that are specifically designed to process classified information fall\noutside the scope of this Regulation. Member States are encouraged to ensure\nthe same or a higher level of protection for those products as for those\nfalling within the scope of this Regulation.(27) Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council(12) establishes requirements for\nthe type-approval of vehicles, and of their systems and components,\nintroducing certain cybersecurity requirements, including on the operation of\na certified cybersecurity management system, on software updates, covering\norganisations\u2019 policies and processes for cybersecurity risks related to the\nentire lifecycle of vehicles, equipment and services in compliance with the\napplicable United Nations regulations on technical specifications and\ncybersecurity, notably UN Regulation No 155 \u2013 Uniform provisions concerning\nthe approval of vehicles with regard to cybersecurity and cybersecurity\nmanagement system and providing for specific conformity assessment\nprocedures.In the area of aviation, the principal objective of Regulation (EU)\n2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council(13) is to establish\nand maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union. It\ncreates a framework for essential requirements for airworthiness for\naeronautical products, parts and equipment, including software, that includes\nobligations to protect against information security threats. The certification\nprocess under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 ensures the level of assurance aimed\nfor by this Regulation. Products with digital elements to which Regulation\n(EU) 2019/2144 applies and products certified in accordance with Regulation\n(EU) 2018/1139 are therefore not subject to the essential requirements and\nconformity assessment procedures set out in this Regulation.(28) This\nRegulation lays down horizontal cybersecurity rules which are not specific to\nsectors or to certain products with digital elements. Nevertheless, sectoral\nor product-specific Union rules could be introduced, laying down requirements\nthat address all or some of the risks covered by the essential requirements\nset out in this Regulation. In such cases, the application of this Regulation\nto products with digital elements covered by other Union rules laying down\nrequirements that address all or some of the risks covered by the essential\nrequirements set out in this Regulation may be limited or excluded where such\nlimitation or exclusion is consistent with the overall regulatory framework\napplying to those products and where the sectoral rules achieve at least the\nsame level of protection as the one provided for by this Regulation. The\nCommission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation\nby identifying such products and rules. For existing Union law where such\nlimitation or exclusion should apply, this Regulation provides for specific\nprovisions to clarify its relation with that Union law.(29) In order to ensure\nthat products with digital elements made available on the market can be\nrepaired effectively and their durability extended, an exemption should be\nprovided for spare parts. That exemption should cover both spare parts that\nhave the purpose of repairing legacy products made available before the date\nof application of this Regulation and spare parts that have already undergone\na conformity assessment procedure pursuant to this Regulation.(30) Commission\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2022/30(14) specifies that a number of essential\nrequirements set out in Article 3(3), points (d), (e) and (f), of Directive\n2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council(15), relating to\nnetwork harm and misuse of network resources, personal data and privacy, and\nfraud, apply to certain radio equipment. Commission Implementing Decision\n5637/2022 on a standardisation request to the European Standardisation\nOrganisations(16)lays down requirements for the development of specific\nstandards further specifying how those essential requirements should be\naddressed. The essential requirements set out in this Regulation include all\nthe elements of the essential requirements referred to in Article 3(3), points\n(d), (e) and (f), of Directive 2014/53/EU. Furthermore, the essential\nrequirements set out in this Regulation are aligned with the objectives of the\nrequirements for specific standards included in that standardisation request.\nTherefore, when the Commission repeals or amends Delegated Regulation (EU)\n2022/30 with the consequence that it ceases to apply to certain products\nsubject to this Regulation, the Commission and the European Standardisation\nOrganisations should take into account the standardisation work carried out in\nthe context of Commission Implementing Decision C(2022)5637 on a\nstandardisation request for Delegated Regulation 2022/30 in the preparation\nand development of harmonised standards to facilitate the implementation of\nthis Regulation. During the transition period of this Regulation, the\nCommission should provide guidance to manufacturers subject to this Regulation\nthat are also subject to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/30 to facilitate the\ndemonstration of compliance with the two Regulations.(31) Council Directive\n85/374/EEC(17) is complementary to this Regulation. That Directive sets out\nliability rules for defective products so that injured persons can claim\ncompensation when a damage has been caused by defective products. It\nestablishes the principle that the manufacturer of a product is liable for\ndamages caused by a lack of safety in their product irrespective of fault\n(strict liability). Where such a lack of safety consists in a lack of security\nupdates after the placing on the market of the product, and this causes\ndamage, the liability of the manufacturer could be triggered. Obligations for\nmanufacturers that concern the provision of such security updates should be\nlaid down in this Regulation.(32) This Regulation should be without prejudice\nto Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council(18),\nincluding to provisions relating to the establishment of data protection\ncertification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the\npurpose of demonstrating compliance of processing operations by controllers\nand processors with that Regulation. Such operations could be embedded in a\nproduct with digital elements. Data protection by design and by default, and\ncybersecurity in general, are key elements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. By\nprotecting consumers and organisations from cybersecurity risks, the essential\ncybersecurity requirements laid down in this Regulation are also to contribute\nto enhancing the protection of personal data and privacy of individuals.\nSynergies on both standardisation and certification on cybersecurity aspects\nshould be considered through the cooperation between the Commission, the\nEuropean Standardisation Organisations, the European Union Agency for\nCybersecurity (ENISA), the European Data Protection Board established by\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679, and the national data protection supervisory\nauthorities. Synergies between this Regulation and Union data protection law\nshould also be created in the area of market surveillance and enforcement.To\nthat end, national market surveillance authorities appointed under this\nRegulation should cooperate with authorities supervising Union data protection\nlaw. The latter should also have access to information relevant for\naccomplishing their tasks.(33) To the extent that their products fall within\nthe scope of this Regulation, providers of European Digital Identity Wallets\nas referred to in Article 7of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European\nParliament and of the Council(19), should comply with both the horizontal\nessential requirements set out in this Regulation and the specific security\nrequirements set out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. In order to\nfacilitate compliance, wallet providers should be able to demonstrate the\ncompliance of European Digital Identity Wallets with the requirements set out\nin this Regulation and in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, respectively, by\ncertifying their products under a European cybersecurity certification scheme\nestablished under Regulation (EU) 2019/881 and for which the Commission has\nspecified, by means of delegated acts, a presumption of conformity for this\nRegulation, in so far as the certificate, or parts thereof, covers those\nrequirements.(34) When integrating components sourced from third parties in\nproducts with digital elements during the design and development phase,\nmanufacturers should, in order to ensure that the products are designed,\ndeveloped and produced in accordance with the essential requirements set out\nin this Regulation, exercise due diligence with regard to those components,\nincluding free and open-source software components that have not been made\navailable on the market. The appropriate level of due diligence depends on the\nnature and the level of cybersecurity risk associated with a given component,\nand should, for that purpose, take into account one or more of the following\nactions: verifying, as applicable, that the manufacturer of a component has\ndemonstrated conformity with this Regulation, including by checking if the\ncomponent already bears the CE marking; verifying that a component receives\nregular security updates, such as by checking its security updates history;\nverifying that a component is free from vulnerabilities registered in the\nEuropean vulnerability database established pursuant to Article 12(2) of\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555 or other publicly accessible vulnerability databases;\nor carrying out additional security tests.The vulnerability handling\nobligations set out in this Regulation, which manufacturers have to comply\nwith when placing a product with digital elements on the market and for the\nsupport period, apply to products with digital elements in their entirety,\nincluding to all integrated components. Where, in the exercise of due\ndiligence, the manufacturer of the product with digital elements identifies a\nvulnerability in a component, including in a free and open-source component,\nit should inform the person or entity manufacturing or maintaining the\ncomponent, address and remediate the vulnerability, and, where applicable,\nprovide the person or entity with the applied security fix.(35) Immediately\nafter the transition period for the application of this Regulation, a\nmanufacturer of a product with digital elements that integrates one or several\ncomponents sourced from third parties which are also subject to this\nRegulation may not be able to verify, as part of its due diligence obligation,\nthat the manufacturers of those components have demonstrated conformity with\nthis Regulation by checking, for instance, if the components already bear the\nCE marking. This may be the case where the components have been integrated\nbefore this Regulation becomes applicable to the manufacturers of those\ncomponents. In such a case, a manufacturer integrating such components should\nexercise due diligence through other means.(36) Products with digital elements\nshould bear the CE marking to visibly, legibly and indelibly indicate their\nconformity with this Regulation so that they can move freely within the\ninternal market. Member States should not create unjustified obstacles to the\nplacing on the market of products with digital elements that comply with the\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE marking.\nFurthermore, at trade fairs, exhibitions and demonstrations or similar events,\nMember States should not prevent the presentation or use of a product with\ndigital elements which does not comply with this Regulation, including its\nprototypes, provided that it is presented with a visible sign clearly\nindicating that the product does not comply with this Regulation and is not to\nbe made available on the market until it complies with this Regulation.(37) In\norder to ensure that manufacturers can release software for testing purposes\nbefore subjecting their products to conformity assessment, Member States\nshould not prevent the making available of unfinished software, such as alpha\nversions, beta versions or release candidates, provided that the unfinished\nsoftware is made available only for the time necessary to test it and gather\nfeedback. Manufacturers should ensure that software made available under those\nconditions is released only following a risk assessment and that it complies\nto the extent possible with the security requirements relating to the\nproperties of products with digital elements laid down in this Regulation.\nManufacturers should also implement the vulnerability handling requirements to\nthe extent possible. Manufacturers should not force users to upgrade to\nversions only released for testing purposes.(38) In order to ensure that\nproducts with digital elements, when placed on the market, do not pose\ncybersecurity risks to persons and organisations, essential requirements\nshould be set out for such products. Those essential requirements, including\nvulnerability management handling requirements, apply to each individual\nproduct with digital elements when placed on the market, irrespective of\nwhether the product with digital elements is manufactured as an individual\nunit or in series. For example, for a product type, each individual product\nwith digital elements should have received all security patches or updates\navailable to address relevant security issues when it is placed on the market.\nWhere products with digital elements are subsequently modified, by physical or\ndigital means, in a way that is not foreseen by the manufacturer in the\ninitial risk assessment and that may imply that they no longer meet the\nrelevant essential requirements, the modification should be considered as\nsubstantial. For example, \u258c repairs could be assimilated to maintenance\noperations provided that they do not modify a product with digital elements\nalready placed on the market in such a way that compliance with the applicable\nrequirements may be affected, or that the intended purpose for which the\nproduct has been assessed may be changed. \u258c(39) As is the case for physical\nrepairs or modifications, a product with digital elements should be considered\nas substantially modified by a software change where the software update\nmodifies the intended purpose of that product and those changes were not\nforeseen by the manufacturer in the initial risk assessment, or where the\nnature of the hazard has changed or the level of cybersecurity risk has\nincreased because of the software update, and the updated version of the\nproduct is made available on the market. Where security updates, which are\ndesigned to decrease the level of cybersecurity risk of a product with digital\nelements, do not modify the intended purpose of a product with digital\nelements, they are not considered a substantial modification. This usually\nincludes situations where security updates entail only minor adjustments of\nthe source code. For example, this could be the case where a security update\naddresses a known vulnerability, including by modifying functions or the\nperformance of a product with digital elements for the sole purpose of\ndecreasing the level of cybersecurity risk. Similarly, minor functionality\nupdates, such as visual enhancements, the addition of new languages to the\nuser interface or of a new set of pictograms, should generally not be\nconsidered to be substantial modifications.Conversely, where feature updates\nmodify the original intended functions or the type or performance of a product\nwith digital elements and meet those criteria, they should be considered a\nsubstantial modification, as the addition of new features typically leads to a\nbroader attack surface, thereby increasing the cybersecurity risk. For\nexample, this could be the case where a new input element is added to an\napplication, requiring the manufacturer to ensure adequate input validation.\nIn assessing whether a feature update is considered a substantial modification\nit is not relevant whether it is provided as a separate update or in\ncombination with a security update. The Commission should issue guidelines on\nhow to determine what constitutes a substantial modification.(40) Taking into\naccount the iterative nature of software development, manufacturers that have\nplaced subsequent versions of a software product on the market as a result of\nsubsequent substantial modifications of that product should be able to provide\nsecurity updates for the support period only for the version of the software\nproduct that they have last placed on the market. They should be able to do so\nonly if the users of the relevant previous product versions have access to the\nproduct version last placed on the market free of charge and do not incur\nadditional costs to adjust the hardware and software environment in which they\noperate the product. This could for instance be the case where a desktop\noperating system upgrade does not require new hardware, such as a faster\ncentral processing unit or more memory. Nonetheless, the manufacturer should\ncontinue to comply, for the support period, with other vulnerability handling\nrequirements, such as having a policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure\nor measures in place to facilitate the sharing of information about potential\nvulnerabilities for all subsequent substantially modified versions of the\nsoftware product placed on the market.Manufacturers should be able to provide\nminor security or functionality updates that do not constitute a substantial\nmodification only for the latest version or sub-version of a software product\nthat has not been substantially modified. At the same time, where a hardware\nproduct, such as a smartphone, is not compatible with the latest version of\nthe operating system it was originally delivered with, the manufacturer should\ncontinue to provide security updates at least for the latest compatible\nversion of the operating system for the support period.(41) In line with the\ncommonly established concept of substantial modification for products\nregulated by Union harmonisation legislation, whenever a substantial\nmodification occurs that may affect the compliance of a product with digital\nelements with this Regulation or when the intended purpose of that product\nchanges, it is appropriate that the compliance of the product with digital\nelements is verified and that, where applicable, it undergoes a new conformity\nassessment. Where applicable, if the manufacturer undertakes a conformity\nassessment involving a third party, changes that might lead to substantial\nmodifications should be notified to the third party.(42) \u2018Refurbishing\u2019,\n\u2018maintaining\u2019 and \u2018repairing\u2019 of a product with digital elements, as defined\nin Article 2, points (18), (19) and (20), of Regulation (EU).../... of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council(20) [Eco-design Regulation], does not\nnecessarily lead to a substantial modification of the product, for instance if\nthe intended purpose and functionalities are not changed and the level of risk\nremains unaffected. However, an upgrade of a product with digital elements by\nthe manufacturer might lead to changes in the design and development of that\nproduct and therefore might affect the intended purpose and the compliance of\nthe product with digital elements with the requirements set out in this\nRegulation.(43) Products with digital elements should be considered important\nif the negative impact of the exploitation of potential vulnerabilities in the\nproduct can be severe due to, amongst others, the cybersecurity-related\nfunctionality or a function carrying a significant risk of adverse effects in\nterms of its intensity and ability to disrupt, control or cause damage to a\nlarge number of other products with digital elements or to the health,\nsecurity or safety of its users through direct manipulation, such as a central\nsystem function, including network management, configuration control,\nvirtualisation or processing of personal data. In particular, vulnerabilities\nin products with digital elements that have a cybersecurity-related\nfunctionality, such as boot managers, can lead to a propagation of security\nissues throughout the supply chain. The severity of the impact of an incident\nmay also increase where the product performs a central system function,\nincluding network management, configuration control, virtualisation or\nprocessing of personal data.(44) Certain categories of products with digital\nelements should be subject to stricter conformity assessment procedures, while\nkeeping a proportionate approach. For that purpose, important products with\ndigital elements should be divided into two classes, reflecting the level of\ncybersecurity risk linked to those categories of products. An incident\ninvolving important products with digital elements that fall under class II\nmight lead to greater negative impacts than an incident involving important\nproducts with digital elements that fall under class I, for instance due to\nthe nature of their cybersecurity-related function or the performance of\nanother function which carries a significant risk of adverse effects. As an\nindication of such greater negative impacts, products with digital elements\nthat fall under in class II could either perform a cybersecurity-related\nfunctionality or another function which carries a significant risk of adverse\neffects that is higher than for those listed in class I, or meet both of the\naforementioned criteria. Important products with digital elements that fall\nunder class II should therefore be subject to a stricter conformity assessment\nprocedure.(45) Important products with digital elements referred to in this\nRegulation should be understood as products which have the core functionality\nof a category of important products with digital elements that is set out in\nthis Regulation. For example, this Regulation sets out categories of important\nproducts with digital elements which are defined by their core functionality\nas firewalls or intrusion detection or prevention systems in class II. As a\nresult, firewalls and intrusion detection or prevention systems are subject to\nmandatory third-party conformity assessment. This is not the case for other\nproducts with digital elements not categorised as important products with\ndigital elements which may integrate firewalls or intrusion detection or\nprevention systems. The Commission should adopt an implementing act to specify\nthe technical description of the categories of important products with digital\nelements that fall under classes I and II as set out in this Regulation.(46)\nThe categories of critical products with digital elements set out in this\nRegulation have a cybersecurity-related functionality and perform a function\nwhich carries a significant risk of adverse effects in terms of its intensity\nand ability to disrupt, control or damage a large number of other products\nwith digital elements through direct manipulation. Furthermore, those\ncategories of product are considered to be critical dependencies for essential\nentities referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555. The\ncategories of critical products with digital elements set out in an annex to\nthis Regulation, due to their criticality, already widely use various forms of\ncertification, and are also covered by the European Common Criteria-based\ncybersecurity certification scheme set out in the [Commission Implementing\nRegulation (EU) No .../... of ... on the European Common Criteria-based\ncybersecurity certification scheme(21)] (EUCC). Therefore, in order to ensure\na common adequate cybersecurity protection of critical products with digital\nelements in the Union, it could be adequate and proportionate to subject such\ncategories of product, by means of a delegated act, to mandatory European\ncybersecurity certification where a relevant European cybersecurity\ncertification scheme covering those products is already in place and an\nassessment of the potential market impact of the envisaged mandatory\ncertification has been carried out by the Commission.That assessment should\nconsider both the supply and demand side, including whether there is\nsufficient demand for the products with digital elements concerned from both\nMember States and users for European cybersecurity certification to be\nrequired, as well as the purposes for which the products with digital elements\nare intended to be used, such as critical dependencies by essential entities\nreferred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555. The assessment should\nalso analyse the potential effects of the mandatory certification on the\navailability of those products on the internal market and the capabilities and\nthe readiness of the Member States for the implementation of the relevant\nEuropean cybersecurity certification schemes.(47) Delegated acts requiring\nmandatory European cybersecurity certification should determine the products\nwith digital elements that have the core functionality of a category of\ncritical products with digital elements set out in this Regulation that are to\nbe subject to mandatory certification, as well as the required assurance\nlevel, which should be at least \u2018substantial\u2019. The required assurance level\nshould be proportionate to the level of cybersecurity risk associated with the\nproduct with digital elements. For instance, where the product with digital\nelements has the core functionality of a category of critical products with\ndigital elements set out in this Regulation and is intended for the use in a\nsensitive or critical environment, such as products intended for the use of\nessential entities referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, it\nmay require the highest assurance level.(48) In order to ensure a common\nadequate cybersecurity protection in the Union of products with digital\nelements that have the core functionality of a category of critical products\nwith digital elements set out in this Regulation, the Commission should also\nbe empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend this Regulation by adding\nfurther or withdrawing categories of critical products with digital elements\nfor which manufacturers could be required to obtain a European cybersecurity\ncertificate under a European cybersecurity certification scheme pursuant to\nRegulation (EU) 2019/881 to demonstrate conformity with this Regulation. A new\ncategory of critical products with digital elements can be added to those\ncategories if there is a critical dependency on it of essential entities\nreferred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 or, if affected by\nincidents or when containing exploited vulnerabilities, this can lead to\ndisruptions for critical supply chains. When assessing the need for adding or\nwithdrawing categories of critical products with digital elements by means of\na delegated act, the Commission should be able to take into account whether\nthe Member States have identified at national level products with digital\nelements that have a critical role for the resilience of essential entities\nreferred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and which increasingly\nface supply chain cyberattacks, with potential serious disruptive\neffects.Furthermore, the Commission should be able to take into account the\noutcome of the Union level coordinated security risk assessment of critical\nsupply chains carried out in accordance with Article 22 of Directive (EU)\n2022/2555.(49) The Commission should ensure that a wide range of relevant\nstakeholders are consulted in a structured and regular manner when preparing\nmeasures for the implementation of this Regulation. This should particularly\nbe the case where the Commission assesses the need for potential updates to\nthe lists of categories of important or critical products with digital\nelements, where relevant manufacturers should be consulted and their views\ntaken into account in order to analyse the cybersecurity risks as well as the\nbalance of costs and benefits of designating such categories of products as\nimportant or critical.(50) This Regulation addresses cybersecurity risks in a\ntargeted manner. Products with digital elements might, however, pose other\nsafety risks, that are not always related to cybersecurity but can be a\nconsequence of a security breach. Those risks should continue to be regulated\nby relevant Union harmonisation legislation other than this Regulation. If no\nUnion harmonisation legislation other than this Regulation is applicable, they\nshould be subject to Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and\nthe Council(22). Therefore, in light of the targeted nature of this\nRegulation, as a derogation from Article 2(1), third subparagraph, point (b),\nof Regulation (EU) 2023/988, Chapter III, Section 1, Chapters V and VII, and\nChapters IX to XI of Regulation (EU) 2023/988 should apply to products with\ndigital elements with respect to safety risks not covered by this Regulation,\nif those products are not subject to specific requirements laid down in Union\nharmonisation legislation other than this Regulation within the meaning of \u258c\nArticle 3, point (27) of Regulation (EU) 2023/988.(51) Products with digital\nelements classified as high-risk AI systems pursuant to [Article 6] of\nRegulation (EU).../... of the European Parliament and of the Council(23) [the\nAI Regulation] which fall within the scope of this Regulation should comply\nwith the essential requirements set out in this Regulation. Where those high-\nrisk AI systems fulfil the essential requirements of this Regulation, they\nshould be deemed to comply with the cybersecurity requirements set out in\n[Article 15] of Regulation... [the AI Regulation] in so far as those\nrequirements are covered by the EU declaration of conformity or parts thereof\nissued under this Regulation. For that purpose, the assessment of the\ncybersecurity risks associated with a product with digital elements classified\nas a high-risk AI system pursuant to Regulation... [the AI Regulation] that\nare to be taken into account during the planning, design, development,\nproduction, delivery and maintenance phases of such product, as required under\nthis Regulation, should take into account risks to the cyber resilience of an\nAI system as regards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use,\nbehaviour or performance, including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data\npoisoning or adversarial attacks, as well as, as relevant, risks to\nfundamental rights, in accordance with Regulation... [AI Regulation]. As\nregards the conformity assessment procedures relating to the essential\ncybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements that falls\nwithin the scope of this Regulation and that is classified as a high-risk AI\nsystem, [Article 43] of Regulation... [the AI Regulation] should apply as a\nrule instead of the relevant provisions of this Regulation. However, that rule\nshould not result in a reduction of the necessary level of assurance for\nimportant and critical products with digital elements as referred to in this\nRegulation. Therefore, by way of derogation from that rule, high-risk AI\nsystems that fall within the scope of Regulation [the AI Regulation] which are\nalso important and critical products with digital elements as referred to in\nthis Regulation and to which the conformity assessment procedure based on\ninternal control referred to in Annex VI to Regulation [the AI Regulation]\napplies, should be subject to the conformity assessment procedures provided\nfor in this Regulation in so far as the essential requirements of this\nRegulation are concerned. In such a case, for all the other aspects covered by\nRegulation... [the AI Regulation] the relevant provisions on conformity\nassessment based on internal control set out in Annex VI to that Regulation\nshould apply.(52) In order to improve the security of products with digital\nelements placed on the internal market it is necessary to lay down essential\nrequirements applicable to such products. Those essential requirements should\nbe without prejudice to the Union level coordinated security risk assessments\nof critical supply chains provided for in Article 22 of Directive (EU)\n2022/2555, which take into account both technical and, where relevant, non-\ntechnical risk factors, such as undue influence by a third country on\nsuppliers. Furthermore, they should be without prejudice to the Member States\u2019\nprerogative to lay down additional requirements that take account of non-\ntechnical factors for the purpose of ensuring a high level of resilience,\nincluding those defined in Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/534(24), in the\nEU coordinated risk assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks and in the\nEU Toolbox on 5G cybersecurity agreed by the \u258c Cooperation Group established\npursuant to Article 14 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.(53) Manufacturers of\nproducts falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 of the European\nParliament and of the Council(25) which are also products with digital\nelements within the meaning of this Regulation should comply with both the\nessential requirements set out in this Regulation and the essential health and\nsafety requirements set out in Regulation (EU) 2023/1230. The essential\nrequirements set out in this Regulation and certain essential requirements of\nRegulation (EU) 2023/1230 might address similar cybersecurity risks.\nTherefore, the compliance with the essential requirements set out in this\nRegulation could facilitate the compliance with the essential requirements\nthat also cover certain cybersecurity risks as set out in Regulation (EU)\n2023/1230, and in particular those regarding the protection against corruption\nand safety and reliability of control systems set out in sections 1.1.9 and\n1.2.1 of Annex III to that Regulation. Such synergies have to be demonstrated\nby the manufacturer, for instance by applying, where available, harmonised\nstandards or other technical specifications covering relevant essential\nrequirements following a risk assessment covering those cybersecurity risks.\nThe manufacturer should also follow the applicable conformity assessment\nprocedures set out in this Regulation and in Regulation (EU) 2023/1230. The\nCommission and the European Standardisation Organisations, in the preparatory\nwork supporting the implementation of this Regulation and of Regulation (EU)\n2023/1230 and the related standardisation processes, should promote\nconsistency in how the cybersecurity risks are to be assessed and in how those\nrisks are to be covered by harmonised standards with regard to the relevant\nessential requirements. In particular, the Commission and the European\nStandardisation Organisations should take into account this Regulation in the\npreparation and development of harmonised standards to facilitate the\nimplementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 as regards in particular the\ncybersecurity aspects related to the protection against corruption and safety\nand reliability of control systems set out in sections 1.1.9 and 1.2.1 of\nAnnex III to that Regulation. The Commission should provide guidance to\nsupport manufacturers subject to this Regulation that are also subject to\nRegulation (EU) 2023/1230, in particular to facilitate the demonstration of\ncompliance with relevant essential requirements set out in this Regulation and\nRegulation (EU) 2023/1230.(54) Regulation (EU).../... of the European\nParliament and of the Council(26) [European Health Data Space Regulation]\ncomplements the essential requirements set out in this Regulation. The\nelectronic health record systems (EHR systems) that fall within the scope of\nRegulation [European Health Data Space Regulation] which are products with\ndigital elements within the meaning of this Regulation should therefore also\ncomply with the essential requirements set out in this Regulation. Their\nmanufacturers should demonstrate conformity as required by Regulation\n[European Health Data Space Regulation]. To facilitate compliance,\nmanufacturers should be able to draw up a single technical documentation\ncontaining the elements required pursuant to this Regulation and Regulation\n.... As this Regulation does not cover SaaS directly, EHR systems offered\nthrough the SaaS licensing and delivery model do not fall within the scope of\nthis Regulation. Similarly, EHR systems that are developed and used in-house\ndo not fall within the scope of this Regulation, as they are not placed on the\nmarket.(55) In order to ensure that products with digital elements are secure\nboth at the time of their placing on the market as well as during the time the\nproduct is expected to be in use, it is necessary to lay down essential\nrequirements for vulnerability handling and essential cybersecurity\nrequirements relating to the properties of products with digital elements.\nWhile manufacturers should comply with all essential requirements related to\nvulnerability handling throughout the support period, they should determine\nwhich other essential requirements related to the product properties are\nrelevant for the type of product with digital elements concerned. For that\npurpose, manufacturers should undertake an assessment of the cybersecurity\nrisks associated with a product with digital elements to identify relevant\nrisks and relevant essential requirements in order to make available their\nproducts with digital elements without known exploitable vulnerabilities that\nmight have an impact on the security of those products and to appropriately\napply suitable harmonised standards, common specifications or European or\ninternational standards.(56) Where certain essential requirements are not\napplicable to a product with digital elements, the manufacturer should include\na clear justification in the cybersecurity risk assessment included in the\ntechnical documentation. This could be the case where an essential requirement\nis incompatible with the nature of a product with digital elements. For\nexample, the intended purpose of a product with digital elements may require\nthe manufacturer to follow widely recognised interoperability standards even\nif its security features are no longer considered state of the art. Similarly,\nother Union law requires manufacturers to apply specific interoperability\nrequirements. Where an essential requirement is not applicable to a product\nwith digital elements, but the manufacturer has identified cybersecurity risks\nin relation to that essential requirement, it should take measures to address\nthose risks by other means, for instance by limiting the intended purpose of\nthe product to trusted environments or by informing the users about those\nrisks.(57) One of the most important measures for users to take in order to\nprotect their products with digital elements from cyberattacks is to install\nthe latest available security updates as soon as possible. Manufacturers\nshould therefore design their products and put in place processes to ensure\nthat products with digital elements include functions that enable the\nnotification, distribution, download and installation of security updates\nautomatically, in particular in the case of consumer products. They should\nalso provide the possibility to approve the download and installation of the\nsecurity updates as a final step. Users should retain the ability to\ndeactivate automatic updates, with a clear and easy-to-use mechanism,\nsupported by clear instructions on how users can opt out. The requirements\nrelating to automatic updates laid down in an annex to this Regulation are not\napplicable to products with digital elements primarily intended to be\nintegrated as components into other products. They also do not apply to\nproducts with digital elements for which users would not reasonably expect\nautomatic updates, including products with digital elements intended to be\nused in professional ICT networks, and especially in critical and industrial\nenvironments where an automatic update could cause interference with\noperations.Irrespective of whether a product with digital elements is designed\nto receive automatic updates or not, its manufacturer should inform users\nabout vulnerabilities and make security updates available without delay. Where\na product with digital elements has a user interface or similar technical\nmeans allowing direct interaction with its users, the manufacturer should make\nuse of such features to inform users that their product with digital elements\nhas reached the end of the support period. Notifications should be limited to\nwhat is necessary in order to ensure the effective reception of this\ninformation and should not have a negative impact on the user experience of\nthe product with digital elements.(58) To improve the transparency of\nvulnerability handling processes and to ensure that users are not required to\ninstall new functionality updates for the sole purpose of receiving the latest\nsecurity updates, manufacturers should ensure, where technically feasible,\nthat new security updates are provided separately from functionality\nupdates.(59) The joint communication of the Commission and the High\nRepresentative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of 20 June\n2023entitled \u2018European Economic Security Strategy\u2019 stated that the Union needs\nto maximise the benefits of its economic openness while minimising the risks\nfrom economic dependencies on high-risk vendors, through a common strategic\nframework for Union economic security. Dependencies on high-risk suppliers of\nproducts with digital elements may pose a strategic risk that needs to be\naddressed at Union level, especially where the products with digital elements\nare intended for the use by essential entities referred to in Article 3(1) of\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555. Such risks may be linked, but not limited, to the\njurisdiction applicable to the manufacturer, the characteristics of its\ncorporate ownership and the links of control to a third-country government\nwhere it is established, in particular where a country engages in economic\nespionage or irresponsible state behaviour in cyberspace and its legislation\nallows arbitrary access to any kind of company operations or data, including\ncommercially sensitive data, and can impose obligations for intelligence\npurposes without democratic checks and balances, oversight mechanisms, due\nprocess or the right to appeal to an independent court or tribunal.When\ndetermining the significance of a cybersecurity risk within the meaning of\nthis Regulation, the Commission and the market surveillance authorities, as\nper their responsibilities set out in this Regulation, should also consider\nnon-technical risk factors, in particular those established as a result of\nUnion level coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains\ncarried out in accordance with Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.(60) For\nthe purpose of ensuring the security of products with digital elements after\ntheir placing on the market, manufacturers should determine support periods,\nwhich should reflect the time the product with digital elements is expected to\nbe in use. In determining a support period, a manufacturer should take into\naccount in particular reasonable user expectations, the nature of the product,\nas well as relevant Union law determining the lifetime of products with\ndigital elements. Manufacturers should also be able to take into account other\nrelevant factors. Criteria should be applied in a manner that ensures\nproportionality in the determination of the support periods. Upon request, a\nmanufacturer should provide market surveillance authorities with the\ninformation that was taken into account to determine the support period of a\nproduct with digital elements.(61) The support period for which the\nmanufacturer ensures the effective handling of vulnerabilities should be no\nless than five years, unless the lifetime of the product with digital elements\nis less than five years, in which case the manufacturer should ensure the\nvulnerability handling for that lifetime. Where the time the product with\ndigital elements is reasonably expected to be in use is longer than five\nyears, as is often the case for hardware components such as motherboards or\nmicroprocessors, network devices such as routers, modems or switches, as well\nas software, such as operating systems or video-editing tools, manufacturers\nshould accordingly ensure longer support periods. In particular, products with\ndigital elements intended for use in industrial settings, such as industrial\ncontrol systems, are often in use for significantly longer periods of time. A\nmanufacturer should be able to define a support period of less than five years\nonly where this is justified by the nature of the product with digital\nelements concerned and where that product is expected to be in use for less\nthan five years, in which case the support period should correspond to the\nexpected use time. For instance, the lifetime of a contact tracing application\nintended for use during a pandemic could be limited to the duration of the\npandemic.Moreover, some software applications can by nature only be made\navailable on the basis of a subscription model, in particular where the\napplication becomes unavailable to the user and is consequently not in use\nanymore once the subscription expires.(62) When products with digital elements\nreach the end of their support periods, in order to ensure that\nvulnerabilities can be handled after the end of the support period,\nmanufacturers should consider releasing the source code of such products with\ndigital elements either to other undertakings which commit to extending the\nprovision of vulnerability handling services or to the public. Where\nmanufacturers release the source code to other undertakings, they should be\nable to protect the ownership of the product with digital elements and prevent\nthe dissemination of the source code to the public, for example through\ncontractual arrangements.(63) In order to ensure that manufacturers across the\nUnion determine similar support periods for comparable products with digital\nelements, ADCO should publish statistics on the average support periods\ndetermined by manufacturers for categories of products with digital elements\nand issue guidance indicating appropriate support periods for such categories.\nIn addition, with a view to ensuring a harmonised approach across the internal\nmarket, the Commission should be able to adopt delegated acts to specify\nminimum support periods for specific product categories where the data\nprovided by market surveillance authorities suggests that the support periods\ndetermined by manufacturers are either systematically not in line with the\ncriteria for determining the support periods as laid down in this Regulation\nor that manufacturers in different Member States unjustifiably determine\ndifferent support periods.(64) Manufacturers should set up a single point of\ncontact that enables users to communicate easily with them, including for the\npurpose of reporting on and receiving information about the vulnerabilities of\nthe product with digital element. They should make the single point of contact\neasily accessible for users and clearly indicate its availability, keeping\nthis information up to date. Where manufacturers choose to offer automated\ntools, e.g. chat boxes, they should also offer a phone number or other digital\nmeans of contact, such as an email address or a contact form. The single point\nof contact should not rely exclusively on automated tools.(65) Manufacturers\nshould make their products with digital elements available on the market with\na secure by default configuration and provide security updates to users free\nof charge. Manufacturers should only be able to deviate from those essential\nrequirements in relation to tailor-made products that are fitted to a\nparticular purpose for a particular business user and where both the\nmanufacturer and the user have explicitly agreed to a different set of\ncontractual terms.(66) Manufacturers should notify simultaneously via the\nsingle reporting platform both the Computer Security Incident Response Team\n(CSIRT) designated as coordinator as well as ENISA of actively exploited\nvulnerabilities contained in products with digital elements, as well as severe\nincidents having an impact on the security of those products. The\nnotifications should be submitted using the electronic notification end-point\nof a CSIRT designated as coordinator and should be simultaneously accessible\nto ENISA.(67) Manufacturers should notify actively exploited vulnerabilities\nto ensure that the CSIRTs designated as coordinators, and ENISA, have an\nadequate overview of such vulnerabilities and are provided with the\ninformation necessary to fulfil their tasks as set out in Directive (EU)\n2022/2555 and raise the overall level of cybersecurity of essential and\nimportant entities referred to in Article 3 of that Directive, as well as to\nensure the effective functioning of market surveillance authorities \u258c. As most\nproducts with digital elements are marketed across the entire internal market,\nany exploited vulnerability in a product with digital elements should be\nconsidered a threat to the functioning of the internal market. ENISA should,\nin agreement with the manufacturer, disclose fixed vulnerabilities to the\nEuropean vulnerability database established pursuant to Article 12(2) of\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555. The European vulnerability database will assist\nmanufacturers in detecting known exploitable vulnerabilities in their\nproducts, in order to ensure that secure products are made available on the\nmarket.(68) Manufacturers should also notify any severe incident having an\nimpact on the security of the product with digital elements to the CSIRT\ndesignated as coordinator and ENISA \u258c. In order to ensure that users can react\nquickly to severe incidents having an impact on the security of their products\nwith digital elements, manufacturers should also inform their users about any\nsuch incident and, where applicable, about any corrective measures that the\nusers can deploy to mitigate the impact of the incident, for example by\npublishing relevant information on their websites or, where the manufacturer\nis able to contact the users and where justified by the cybersecurity risks,\nby reaching out to the users directly.(69) Actively exploited vulnerabilities\nconcern instances where a manufacturer establishes that a security breach\naffecting its users or any other natural or legal persons has resulted from a\nmalicious actor making use of a flaw in one of the products with digital\nelements made available on the market by the manufacturer. Examples of such\nvulnerabilities could be weaknesses in a product\u2019s identification and\nauthentication functions. Vulnerabilities that are discovered with no\nmalicious intent for purposes of good faith testing, investigation, correction\nor disclosure to promote the security or safety of the system owner and its\nusers should not be subject to mandatory notification. Severe incidents having\nan impact on the security of the product with digital elements, on the other\nhand, refer to situations where a cybersecurity incident affects the\ndevelopment, production or maintenance processes of the manufacturer in such a\nway that it could result in an increased cybersecurity risk for users or other\npersons. Such a severe incident could include a situation where an attacker\nhas successfully introduced malicious code into the release channel via which\nthe manufacturer releases security updates to users.(70) To ensure that\nnotifications can be disseminated quickly to all relevant CSIRTs designated as\ncoordinators and to enable manufacturers to submit a single notification at\neach stage of the notification process, a single reporting platform with\nnational electronic notification end-points should be established by ENISA.\nThe day-to-day operations of the single reporting platform should be managed\nand maintained by ENISA. The CSIRTs designated as coordinators should inform\ntheir respective market surveillance authorities about notified\nvulnerabilities or incidents. The single reporting platform should be designed\nin such a way that it ensures the confidentiality of notifications, in\nparticular as regards vulnerabilities for which a security update is not yet\navailable. In addition, ENISA should put in place procedures to handle\ninformation in a secure and confidential manner. On the basis of the\ninformation it gathers, ENISA should prepare a biennial technical report on\nemerging trends regarding cybersecurity risks in products with digital\nelements and submit it to the Cooperation Group established pursuant to\nArticle 14 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.(71) In exceptional circumstances and\nin particular upon request by the manufacturer, the CSIRT designated as\ncoordinator initially receiving a notification should be able to decide to\ndelay its dissemination to the other relevant CSIRTs designated as\ncoordinators via the single reporting platform where this can be justified on\ncybersecurity-related grounds and for a period of time that is strictly\nnecessary. The CSIRT designated as coordinator should immediately inform ENISA\nabout the decision to delay and on which grounds, as well as when it intends\nto disseminate further. The Commission should develop, through a delegated\nact, specifications on the terms and conditions for when cybersecurity related\ngrounds could be applied and should cooperate with the CSIRTs network\nestablished pursuant to Article 15 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (CSIRTs\nnetwork), and ENISA in preparing the draft delegated act. Examples of\ncybersecurity related grounds include an ongoing coordinated vulnerability\ndisclosure procedure or situations in which a manufacturer is expected to\nprovide a mitigating measure shortly and the cybersecurity risks of an\nimmediate dissemination via the single reporting platform outweigh its\nbenefits. If requested by the CSIRT designated as coordinator, ENISA should be\nable to support that CSIRT on the application of cybersecurity related grounds\nin relation to delaying the dissemination of the notification based on the\ninformation ENISA has received from that CSIRT on the decision to withhold a\nnotification on those cybersecurity grounds. Furthermore, in particularly\nexceptional circumstances, ENISA should not receive all the details of a\nnotification of an actively exploited vulnerability in a simultaneous manner.\nThis would be the case when the manufacturer marks in its notification that\nthe notified vulnerability has been actively exploited by a malicious actor\nand that, according to the information available, it has been exploited in no\nother Member State than the one of the CSIRT designated as coordinator to\nwhich the manufacturer has notified the vulnerability, when any immediate\nfurther dissemination of the notified vulnerability would likely result in the\nsupply of information the disclosure of which would be contrary to the\nessential interests of that Member State, or when the notified vulnerability\nposes an imminent high cybersecurity risk stemming from the further\ndissemination. In such cases, ENISA will only receive simultaneous access to\nthe information that a notification was made by the manufacturer, general\ninformation about the product with digital elements concerned, the information\nabout the general nature of the exploit and information about the fact that\nthose security grounds were raised by the manufacturer and that the full\ncontent of the notification is therefore withheld. The full notification\nshould then be made available to ENISA and other relevant CSIRTs designated as\ncoordinators when the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the\nnotification finds that those security grounds, reflecting particularly\nexceptional circumstances as established in this Regulation, cease to exist.\nWhere based on the information available ENISA considers that there is a\nsystemic risk affecting the security of the internal market, ENISA should\nrecommend to the recipient CSIRT to disseminate the full notification to the\nother CSIRTs designated as coordinators and to ENISA itself.(72) When\nmanufacturers notify an actively exploited vulnerability or a severe incident\nhaving an impact on the security of the product with digital elements, they\nshould indicate how sensitive they deem the notified information to be. The\nCSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the notification should\ntake this information into account when assessing whether the notification\ngives rise to exceptional circumstances that justify a delay in the\ndissemination of the notification to the other relevant CSIRTs designated as\ncoordinators based on justified cybersecurity related grounds. It should also\ntake that information into account when assessing whether the notification of\nan actively exploited vulnerability gives rise to particularly exceptional\ncircumstances that justify that the full notification is not made available\nsimultaneously to ENISA. Finally, CSIRTs designated as coordinators should be\nable to take that information into account when determining appropriate\nmeasures to mitigate the risks stemming from such vulnerabilities and\nincidents.(73) In order to simplify the reporting of information required\nunder this Regulation, in consideration of other complementary reporting\nrequirements laid down in Union law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679,\nRegulation (EU) 2022/2554 of the European Parliament and of the Council(27),\nDirective 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(28) and\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555, as well as to decrease the administrative burden for\nentities, Member States are encouraged to consider providing at national level\nsingle entry points for such reporting requirements. The use of such national\nsingle entry points for the reporting of security incidents under Regulation\n(EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC should not affect the application of\nthe provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC, in\nparticular those relating to the independence of the authorities referred to\ntherein. When establishing the single reporting platform referred to in this\nRegulation, ENISA should take into account the possibility for the national\nelectronic notification end-points referred to in this Regulation to be\nintegrated into national single entry points that may also integrate other\nnotifications required under Union law.(74) When establishing the single\nreporting platform referred to in this Regulation and in order to benefit from\npast experience, ENISA should consult other Union institutions or agencies\nthat are managing platforms or databases subject to stringent security\nrequirements, such as the European Union Agency for the Operational Management\nof Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-\nLISA). ENISA should also analyse potential complementarities with the European\nvulnerability database established pursuant to Article 12(2) of Directive (EU)\n2022/2555.(75) Manufacturers and other natural and legal persons should be\nable to notify to a CSIRT designated as coordinator or ENISA, on a voluntary\nbasis, any vulnerability contained in a product with digital elements, cyber\nthreats that could affect the risk profile of a product with digital elements,\nany incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital\nelements as well as near misses that could have resulted in such an\nincident.(76) Member States should aim to address, to the extent possible, the\nchallenges faced by vulnerability researchers, including their potential\nexposure to criminal liability, in accordance with national law. Given that\nnatural and legal persons researching vulnerabilities could in some Member\nStates be exposed to criminal and civil liability, Member States are\nencouraged to adopt guidelines as regards the non-prosecution of information\nsecurity researchers and an exemption from civil liability for their\nactivities.(77) Manufacturers of products with digital elements should put in\nplace coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies to facilitate the\nreporting of vulnerabilities by individuals or entities either directly to the\nmanufacturer or indirectly, and where requested anonymously, via CSIRTs\ndesignated as a coordinators for the purposes of coordinated vulnerability\ndisclosure in accordance with Article 12(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.\nManufacturers\u2019 coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy should specify a\nstructured process through which vulnerabilities are reported to a\nmanufacturer in a manner allowing the manufacturer to diagnose and remedy such\nvulnerabilities before detailed vulnerability information is disclosed to\nthird parties or to the public. Moreover, manufacturers should also consider\npublishing their security policies in machine-readable format. Given the fact\nthat information about exploitable vulnerabilities in widely used products\nwith digital elements can be sold at high prices on the black market,\nmanufacturers of such products should be able to use programmes, as part of\ntheir coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies, to incentivise the\nreporting of vulnerabilities by ensuring that individuals or entities receive\nrecognition and compensation for their efforts. This refers to so-called \u2018bug\nbounty programmes\u2019.(78) In order to facilitate vulnerability analysis,\nmanufacturers should identify and document components contained in the\nproducts with digital elements, including by drawing up an SBOM. An SBOM can\nprovide those who manufacture, purchase, and operate software with information\nthat enhances their understanding of the supply chain, which has multiple\nbenefits, in particular it helps manufacturers and users to track known newly\nemerged vulnerabilities and cybersecurity risks. It is of particular\nimportance that manufacturers ensure that their products with digital elements\ndo not contain vulnerable components developed by third parties. Manufacturers\nshould not be obliged to make the SBOM public.(79) Under the new complex\nbusiness models linked to online sales, a business operating online can\nprovide a variety of services. Depending on the nature of the services\nprovided in relation to a given product with digital elements, the same entity\nmay fall within different categories of business models or economic operators.\nWhere an entity provides only online intermediation services for a given\nproduct with digital elements and is merely a provider of an online\nmarketplace as defined in Article 3, point (14), of Regulation (EU) 2023/988,\nit does not qualify as one of the types of economic operator defined in this\nRegulation. Where the same entity is a provider of an online marketplace and\nalso acts as an economic operator as defined in this Regulation for the sale\nof particular products with digital elements, it should be subject to the\nobligations set out in this Regulation for that type of economic operator. For\ninstance, if the provider of an online marketplace also distributes a product\nwith digital elements, then, with respect to the sale of that product, it\nwould be considered to be a distributor.Similarly, if the entity in question\nsells its own branded products with digital elements, it would qualify as a\nmanufacturer and would thus have to comply with the applicable requirements\nfor manufacturers. Also, some entities can qualify as fulfilment service\nproviders as defined in Article 3, point (11), of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council(29) if they offer such services.\nSuch cases would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Given the\nprominent role that online marketplaces have in enabling electronic commerce,\nthey should strive to cooperate with the market surveillance authorities of\nthe Member States in order to help ensure that products with digital elements\npurchased through online marketplaces comply with the cybersecurity\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation.(80) In order to facilitate\nassessment of conformity with the requirements laid down in this Regulation,\nthere should be a presumption of conformity for products with digital elements\nwhich are in conformity with harmonised standards, which translate the\nessential requirements of this Regulation into detailed technical\nspecifications, and which are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\n1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council(30). That Regulation\nprovides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those\nstandards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Regulation. The\nstandardisation process should ensure a balanced representation of interests\nand effective participation of civil society stakeholders, including consumer\norganisations. International standards that are in line with the level of\ncybersecurity protection aimed for by the essential requirements set out in\nthis Regulation should also be taken into account, in order to facilitate the\ndevelopment of harmonised standards and the implementation of this Regulation,\nas well as to facilitate compliance for companies, in particular\nmicroenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises and those operating\nglobally.(81) The timely development of harmonised standards during the\ntransition period and their availability before the date of application of\nthis Regulation will be particularly important for its effective\nimplementation. This is, in particular, the case for important products with\ndigital elements that fall under class I. The availability of harmonised\nstandards will enable manufacturers of such products to perform the conformity\nassessments via the internal control procedure and can therefore avoid\nbottlenecks and delays in the activities of conformity assessment bodies.(82)\nRegulation (EU) 2019/881 establishes a voluntary European cybersecurity\ncertification framework for ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services.\nEuropean cybersecurity certification schemes provide a common framework of\ntrust for users to use products with digital elements that fall within the\nscope of this Regulation. This Regulation should consequently create synergies\nwith Regulation (EU) 2019/881. In order to facilitate the assessment of\nconformity with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, products with\ndigital elements that are certified or for which a statement of conformity has\nbeen issued under a European cybersecurity scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU)\n2019/881 that has been identified by the Commission in an implementing act,\nshall be presumed to be in compliance with the essential requirements set out\nin this Regulation in so far as the European cybersecurity certificate or\nstatement of conformity or parts thereof cover those requirements. The need\nfor new European cybersecurity certification schemes for products with digital\nelements should be assessed in the light of this Regulation, including when\npreparing the Union rolling work programme in accordance with Regulation (EU)\n2019/881.Where there is a need for a new scheme covering products with digital\nelements, including in order to facilitate compliance with this Regulation,\nthe Commission can request ENISA to prepare candidate schemes in accordance\nwith Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881. Such future European\ncybersecurity certification schemes covering products with digital elements\nshould take into account the essential requirements and conformity assessment\nprocedures as set out in this Regulation and facilitate compliance with this\nRegulation. For European cybersecurity certification schemes that enter into\nforce before the entry into force of this Regulation, further specifications\nmay be needed on detailed aspects of how a presumption of conformity can\napply. The Commission, by means of delegated acts, should be empowered to\nspecify under which conditions the European cybersecurity certification\nschemes \u258c can be used to demonstrate conformity with the essential\nrequirements set out in this Regulation. Furthermore, \u258cto avoid undue\nadministrative burdens, there should be no obligation for manufacturers to\ncarry out a third-party conformity assessment as provided for in this\nRegulation for corresponding requirements where a European cybersecurity\ncertificate has been issued under such European cybersecurity certification\nschemes at least at level \u2018substantial\u2019.(83) Upon entry into force of the\nimplementing act setting out the [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\n.../... ] which concerns \u258c products that fall within the scope of this\nRegulation, such as hardware security modules and microprocessors, the\nCommission should be able to specify, by means of a delegated act, how the\nEUCC provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements as\nset out in this Regulation or parts thereof. Furthermore, such a delegated act\nmay specify how a certificate issued under the EUCC eliminates the obligation\nfor manufacturers to carry out a third-party assessment as required pursuant\nto this Regulation for corresponding requirements.(84) The current European\nstandardisation framework, which is based on the New Approach principles set\nout in Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical\nharmonization and standards and on Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, represents\nthe framework by default to elaborate standards that provide for a presumption\nof conformity with the relevant essential requirements set out in this\nRegulation. European standards should be market-driven, take into account the\npublic interest, as well as the policy objectives clearly stated in the\nCommission\u2019s request to one or more European standardisation organisations to\ndraft harmonised standards, within a set deadline, and be based on consensus.\nHowever, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the\nCommission should be able to adopt implementing acts establishing common\nspecifications for the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in this\nRegulation, provided that in doing so it duly respects the role and functions\nof standardisation organisations, as an exceptional fall back solution to\nfacilitate the manufacturer\u2019s obligation to comply with those essential\nrequirements, where the standardisation process is blocked or where there are\ndelays in the establishment of appropriate harmonised standards. If such delay\nis due to the technical complexity of the standard in question, this should be\nconsidered by the Commission before considering the establishment of common\nspecifications.(85) With a view to establishing, in the most efficient way,\ncommon specifications that cover the essential requirements set out in this\nRegulation, the Commission should involve relevant stakeholders in the\nprocess.(86) \u2018Reasonable period\u2019 has the meaning, in relation to the\npublication of reference to harmonised standards in the Official Journal of\nthe European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, of a\nperiod during which the publication in the Official Journal of the European\nUnion of the reference to the standard, its corrigendum or its amendment is\nexpected and which should not exceed one year after the deadline for drafting\na European standard set in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.(87)\nIn order to facilitate the assessment of conformity with the essential\nrequirements set out in this Regulation, there should be a presumption of\nconformity for products with digital elements that are in conformity with the\ncommon specifications adopted by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation\nfor the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those\nrequirements.(88) The application of harmonised standards, common\nspecifications or European cybersecurity certification schemes adopted\npursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 providing presumption of conformity in\nrelation to the essential requirements applicable to products with digital\nelements will facilitate the assessment of conformity by the manufacturers. If\nthe manufacturer chooses not to apply such means for certain requirements,\nthey have to indicate in their technical documentation how the compliance is\nreached otherwise. Furthermore, the application of harmonised standards,\ncommon specifications or European cybersecurity certification schemes adopted\npursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 providing presumption of conformity by\nmanufacturers would facilitate the check of compliance of products with\ndigital elements by market surveillance authorities. Therefore, manufacturers\nof products with digital elements are encouraged to apply such harmonised\nstandards, common specifications or European cybersecurity certification\nschemes.(89) Manufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to\nprovide information required under this Regulation on the conformity of\nproducts with digital elements with the essential requirements set out in this\nRegulation and, where applicable, of the other relevant Union harmonisation\nlegislation by which the product with digital elements is covered.\nManufacturers may also be required to draw up an EU declaration of conformity\nby other Union legal acts. To ensure effective access to information for\nmarket surveillance purposes, a single EU declaration of conformity should be\ndrawn up in respect of compliance with all relevant Union legal acts. In order\nto reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, it should be\npossible for that single EU declaration of conformity to be a dossier made up\nof relevant individual declarations of conformity.(90) The CE marking,\nindicating the conformity of a product, is the visible consequence of a whole\nprocess comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. The general\nprinciples governing the CE marking are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008\nof the European Parliament and of the Council(31). Rules governing the\naffixing of the CE marking on products with digital elements should be laid\ndown in this Regulation. The CE marking should be the only marking which\nguarantees that products with digital elements comply with the requirements\nset out in this Regulation.(91) In order to allow economic operators to\ndemonstrate conformity with the essential requirements set out in this\nRegulation and to allow market surveillance authorities to ensure that\nproducts with digital elements made available on the market comply with those\nrequirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures.\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(32)\nestablishes modules for conformity assessment procedures in proportion to the\nlevel of risk involved and the level of security required. In order to ensure\ninter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessment\nprocedures adequate for verifying the conformity of products with digital\nelements with the essential requirements set out in this Regulation should be\nbased on those modules. The conformity assessment procedures should examine\nand verify both product and process-related requirements covering the whole\nlifecycle of products with digital elements, including planning, design,\ndevelopment or production, testing and maintenance of the product with digital\nelements.(92) \u258c Conformity assessment of products with digital elements that\nare not listed as important or critical products with digital elements in this\nRegulation can be carried out by the manufacturer under its own responsibility\nfollowing the internal control procedure based on Module A of Decision No\n768/2008/EC in accordance with this Regulation. This also applies to cases\nwhere a manufacturer chooses not to apply in whole or in part an applicable\nharmonised standard, common specification or European cybersecurity\ncertification scheme. The manufacturer retains the flexibility to choose a\nstricter conformity assessment procedure involving a third party. Under the\ninternal control conformity assessment procedure, the manufacturer ensures and\ndeclares on its sole responsibility that the product with digital elements and\nthe processes of the manufacturer meet the applicable essential requirements\nset out in this Regulation. If an important product with digital elements\nfalls under class I, additional assurance is required to demonstrate\nconformity with the essential requirements set out in this Regulation. The\nmanufacturer should apply harmonised standards, common specifications or\nEuropean cybersecurity certification schemes adopted pursuant to Regulation\n(EU) 2019/881 if it wants to carry out the conformity assessment under its own\nresponsibility (module A). If the manufacturer does not apply such harmonised\nstandards, common specifications or European cybersecurity certification\nschemes, the manufacturer should undergo conformity assessment involving a\nthird party (based on Modules B and C or H). Taking into account the\nadministrative burden on manufacturers and the fact that cybersecurity plays\nan important role in the design and development phase of tangible and\nintangible products with digital elements, conformity assessment procedures\nbased on modules B+C or module H of Decision No 768/2008/EC have been chosen\nas most appropriate for assessing the compliance of important products with\ndigital elements in a proportionate and effective manner. The manufacturer\nthat carries out the third-party conformity assessment can choose the\nprocedure that best suits its design and production process. Given the even\ngreater cybersecurity risk linked with the use of important products with\ndigital elements that fall under class II \u258c, the conformity assessment should\nalways involve a third party, even where the product complies fully or partly\nwith harmonised standards, common specifications or European cybersecurity\ncertification schemes. Manufacturers of important products with digital\nelements qualifying as free and open-source software should be able to follow\nthe internal control procedure based on Module A, provided that they make the\ntechnical documentation available to the public.(93) While the creation of\ntangible products with digital elements usually requires manufacturers to make\nsubstantial efforts throughout the design, development and production phases,\nthe creation of products with digital elements in the form of software almost\nexclusively focuses on design and development, while the production phase\nplays a minor role. Nonetheless, in many cases software products still need to\nbe compiled, built, packaged, made available for download or copied onto\nphysical media before being placed on the market. Those activities should be\nconsidered as activities amounting to production when applying the relevant\nconformity assessment modules to verify the compliance of the product with the\nessential requirements set out in this Regulation across the design,\ndevelopment and production phases.(94) In relation to microenterprises and\nsmall enterprises, in order to ensure proportionality, it is appropriate to\nalleviate administrative costs without affecting the level of cybersecurity\nprotection of products with digital elements that fall within the scope of\nthis Regulation or the level playing field among manufacturers. It is\ntherefore appropriate for the Commission to establish a simplified technical\ndocumentation form targeted at the needs of microenterprises and small\nenterprises. The simplified technical documentation form adopted by the\nCommission should cover all the applicable elements related to technical\ndocumentation set out in this Regulation and specify how a microenterprise or\na small enterprise can provide the requested elements in a concise way, such\nas the description of the design, development and production of the product\nwith digital elements. In doing so, the form would contribute to alleviating\nthe administrative compliance burden by providing the enterprises concerned\nwith legal certainty about the extent and detail of information to be\nprovided. Microenterprises and small enterprises should be able to choose to\nprovide the applicable elements related to technical documentation in\nextensive form and not take advantage of the simplified technical form\navailable to them.(95) In order to promote and protect innovation, it is\nimportant that the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises\nmanufacturers, in particular microenterprises and small enterprises, including\nstart-ups, are taken into particular account. To that end, Member States could\ndevelop initiatives which are targeted at manufacturers that are\nmicroenterprises or small enterprises, including on training, awareness\nraising, information communication and testing and third-party conformity\nassessment activities, as well as the establishment of sandboxes. Translation\ncosts related to mandatory documentation, such as the technical documentation\nand the information and instructions to the user required pursuant to this\nRegulation, and communication with authorities, may constitute a significant\ncost for manufacturers, in particular those of a smaller size. Therefore,\nMember States should be able to consider that one of the languages determined\nand accepted by them for relevant manufacturers\u2019 documentation and for\ncommunication with manufacturers is one which is broadly understood by the\nlargest possible number of users.(96) In order to ensure a smooth application\nof this Regulation, Member States should strive to ensure, before the date of\napplication of this Regulation, that a sufficient number of notified bodies is\navailable to carry out third-party conformity assessments. The Commission\nshould seek to assist Member States and other relevant parties in this\nendeavour, in order to avoid bottlenecks and hindrances to market entry for\nmanufacturers. Targeted training activities led by Member States, including\nwhere appropriate with the support of the Commission, can contribute to the\navailability of skilled professionals including to support the activities of\nnotified bodies under this Regulation. Furthermore, considering the costs that\nthird-party conformity assessment may entail, funding initiatives at Union and\nnational level that seek to alleviate such costs for microenterprises and\nsmall enterprises should be considered.(97) In order to ensure\nproportionality, conformity assessment bodies, when setting the fees for\nconformity assessment procedures, should take into account the specific\ninterests and needs of microenterprises and small and medium-sized\nenterprises, including start-ups. In particular, conformity assessment bodies\nshould apply the relevant examination procedure and tests provided for in this\nRegulation only where appropriate and following a risk-based approach.(98) The\nobjectives of regulatory sandboxes should be to foster innovation and\ncompetitiveness for businesses by establishing controlled testing environments\nbefore the placing on the market of products with digital elements. Regulatory\nsandboxes should contribute to improve legal certainty for all actors that\nfall within the scope of this Regulation and facilitate and accelerate access\nto the Union market for products with digital elements, in particular when\nprovided by microenterprises and small enterprises, including start-ups.(99)\nIn order to carry out third-party conformity assessment for products with\ndigital elements, conformity assessment bodies should be notified by the\nnational notifying authorities to the Commission and the other Member States,\nprovided they comply with a set of requirements, in particular on\nindependence, competence and absence of conflicts of interest.(100) In order\nto ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity\nassessment of products with digital elements, it is also necessary to lay down\nrequirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the\nassessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies. The system set out\nin this Regulation should be complemented by the accreditation system provided\nfor in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means\nof verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be\nused for the purposes of notification.(101) Conformity assessment bodies that\nhave been accredited and notified under Union law laying down similar\nrequirements to the ones laid down in this Regulation, such as a conformity\nassessment body that has been notified for a European cybersecurity\ncertification scheme adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 or notified\nunder Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/30, should be newly assessed and notified\nunder this Regulation. However, synergies can be defined by relevant\nauthorities regarding any overlapping requirements in order to prevent an\nunnecessary financial and administrative burden and ensure a smooth and timely\nnotification process.(102) Transparent accreditation as provided for in\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in\ncertificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public\nauthorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the\ntechnical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national\nauthorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying\nout that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the\nappropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national\nauthorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States\nwith the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the\nconformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory\nrequirements.(103) Conformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts\nof their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to\na subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for a\nproduct with digital elements to be placed on the market, it is essential that\nconformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same\nrequirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity\nassessment tasks.(104) The notification of a conformity assessment body should\nbe sent by the notifying authority to the Commission and the other Member\nStates via the New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO)\ninformation system. NANDO is the electronic notification tool developed and\nmanaged by the Commission where a list of all notified bodies can be\nfound.(105) Since notified bodies may offer their services throughout the\nUnion, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission\nthe opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is\ntherefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or\nconcerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified\nbefore they start operating as notified bodies.(106) In the interests of\ncompetitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity\nassessment procedures without creating unnecessary burden for economic\noperators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic\noperators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity\nassessment procedures needs to be ensured. That should be best achieved\nthrough appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.(107)\nMarket surveillance is an essential instrument in ensuring the proper and\nuniform application of Union law. It is therefore appropriate to put in place\na legal framework within which market surveillance can be carried out in an\nappropriate manner. Rules on Union market surveillance and control of products\nentering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 apply to\nproducts with digital elements that fall within the scope of this\nRegulation.(108) In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, a market\nsurveillance authority carries out market surveillance in the territory of the\nMember State that designates it. This Regulation should not prevent Member\nStates from choosing the competent authorities to carry out market\nsurveillance tasks. Each Member State should designate one or more market\nsurveillance authorities in its territory. Member States should be able to\nchoose to designate any existing or new authority to act as market\nsurveillance authority, including \u258c competent authorities designated or\nestablished pursuant to Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, national\ncybersecurity certification authorities designated pursuant to Article 58 of\nRegulation (EU) 2019/881 or market surveillance authorities designated for the\npurposes of Directive 2014/53/EU. Economic operators should fully cooperate\nwith market surveillance authorities and other competent authorities. Each\nMember State should inform the Commission and the other Member States of its\nmarket surveillance authorities and the areas of competence of each of those\nauthorities and should ensure the necessary resources and skills to carry out\nthe market surveillance tasks relating to this Regulation. Pursuant to Article\n10(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, each Member State should appoint a\nsingle liaison office that should be responsible, among others, for\nrepresenting the coordinated position of the market surveillance authorities\nand assisting in the cooperation between market surveillance authorities in\ndifferent Member States.(109) A dedicated administrative cooperation group\n(ADCO) for the cyber resilience of products with digital elements should be\nestablished for the uniform application of this Regulation pursuant to Article\n30(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. ADCO should be composed of representatives\nof the designated market surveillance authorities and, if appropriate,\nrepresentatives of the single liaison offices. The Commission should support\nand encourage cooperation between market surveillance authorities through the\nUnion Product Compliance Network established pursuant to Article 29 of\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 and comprising representatives from each Member\nState, including a representative of each single liaison office referred to in\nArticle 10 of that Regulation and an optional national expert, the chairs of\nADCOs, and representatives from the Commission. The Commission should\nparticipate in the meetings of the Product Compliance Union Network, its sub-\ngroups and ADCO. It should also assist ADCO by means of an executive\nsecretariat that provides technical and logistic support. ADCO may also invite\nindependent experts to participate, and liaise with other ADCOs, such as that\nestablished under Directive 2014/53/EU.(110) Market surveillance authorities,\nthrough ADCO established under this Regulation, should cooperate closely and\nshould be able to develop guidance documents to facilitate market surveillance\nactivities at national level, such as by developing best practices and\nindicators to effectively check the compliance of products with digital\nelements with this Regulation.(111) In order to ensure timely, proportionate\nand effective measures in relation to products with digital elements\npresenting a significant cybersecurity risk, a Union safeguard procedure\nshould be provided for under which interested parties are informed of measures\nintended to be taken with regard to such products. This should also allow\nmarket surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic\noperators, to act at an earlier stage where necessary. Where the Member States\nand the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a\nMember State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required,\nexcept where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised\nstandard.(112) In certain cases, a product with digital elements which\ncomplies with this Regulation can nonetheless present a significant\ncybersecurity risk or pose a risk to the health or safety of persons, to\ncompliance with obligations under Union or national law intended to protect\nfundamental rights, to the availability, authenticity, integrity or\nconfidentiality of services offered using an electronic information system by\nessential entities referred to in Article 3(1) of \u258c Directive (EU) 2022/2555\nor to other aspects of public interest protection. Therefore it is necessary\nto establish rules which ensure mitigation of those risks. As a result, market\nsurveillance authorities should take measures to require the economic operator\nto ensure that the product no longer presents that risk, to recall it or to\nwithdraw it, depending on the risk. As soon as a market surveillance authority\nrestricts or forbids the free movement of a product with digital elements in\nsuch way, the Member State should notify without delay the Commission and the\nother Member States of the provisional measures, indicating the reasons and\njustification for the decision.Where a market surveillance authority adopts\nsuch measures against products with digital elements presenting a risk, the\nCommission should enter into consultation with the Member States and the\nrelevant economic operator or operators without delay and should evaluate the\nnational measure. On the basis of the results of this evaluation, the\nCommission should decide whether the national measure is justified or not. The\nCommission should address its decision to all Member States and immediately\ncommunicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators. If the\nmeasure is considered justified, the Commission may also consider adopting\nproposals to revise the relevant Union law.(113) For products with digital\nelements presenting a significant cybersecurity risk, and where there is\nreason to believe that they do not comply with this Regulation, or for\nproducts that comply with this Regulation, but that present other important\nrisks, such as risks to the health or safety of persons, to compliance with\nobligations under Union or national law intended to protect fundamental rights\nor to the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of services\noffered using an electronic information system by essential entities referred\nto in Article 3(1) of \u258cDirective (EU) 2022/2555, the Commission should be able\nto request ENISA to carry out an evaluation. Based on that evaluation, the\nCommission should be able to adopt, by means of implementing acts, corrective\nor restrictive measures at Union level, including requiring the relevant\nproducts with digital elements to be withdrawn from the market or recalled,\nwithin a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk. The\nCommission should be able to have recourse to such intervention only in\nexceptional circumstances that justify an immediate intervention to preserve\nthe proper functioning of the internal market, and only where no effective\nmeasures have been taken by market surveillance authorities to remedy the\nsituation.Such exceptional circumstances may be emergency situations where,\nfor example, a non-compliant product with digital elements is widely made\navailable by the manufacturer throughout several Member States, used also in\nkey sectors by entities that fall within the scope of \u258cDirective (EU)\n2022/2555 while containing known vulnerabilities that are being exploited by\nmalicious actors and for which the manufacturer does not provide available\npatches. The Commission should be able to intervene in such emergency\nsituations only for the duration of the exceptional circumstances and if non-\ncompliance with this Regulation or the important risks presented persist.(114)\nWhere there are indications of non-compliance with this Regulation in several\nMember States, market surveillance authorities should be able to carry out\njoint activities with other authorities, with a view to verifying compliance\nand identifying cybersecurity risks of products with digital elements.(115)\nSimultaneous coordinated control actions (sweeps) are specific enforcement\nactions by market surveillance authorities that can further enhance product\nsecurity. Sweeps should, in particular, be conducted where market trends,\nconsumer complaints or other indications suggest that certain categories of\nproducts with digital elements are often found to present cybersecurity risks.\nFurthermore, when determining the product categories to be subjected to\nsweeps, market surveillance authorities should also take into account\nconsiderations relating to non-technical risk factors. To that end, market\nsurveillance authorities should be able to take into account the results of\nUnion level coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains\ncarried out in accordance with Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555,\nincluding considerations relating to non-technical risk factors. ENISA should\nsubmit proposals for categories of products with digital elements for which\nsweeps could be organised to the market surveillance authorities, based, among\nothers, on the notifications of vulnerabilities and incidents it\nreceives.(116) Considering its expertise and mandate, ENISA should be able to\nsupport the process for implementation of this Regulation. In particular, it\nshould be able to propose joint activities to be conducted by market\nsurveillance authorities based on indications or information regarding\npotential non-compliance with this Regulation of products with digital\nelements across several Member States or identify categories of products for\nwhich sweeps should be organised. In exceptional circumstances, at the request\nof the Commission, ENISA should be able to conduct evaluations in respect of\nspecific products with digital elements that present a significant\ncybersecurity risk, where an immediate intervention is required to preserve\nthe proper functioning of the internal market.(117) This Regulation confers\ncertain tasks upon ENISA which require appropriate resources in terms of both\nexpertise and human resources in order to enable ENISA to carry out those\ntasks effectively. The Commission will propose the necessary budgetary\nresources for ENISA\u2019s establishment plan, in accordance with the procedure set\nout in Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881, when preparing the draft\ngeneral budget of the Union. During that process, the Commission will consider\nENISA\u2019s overall resources to enable it to fulfil its tasks, including those\nconferred on ENISA pursuant to this Regulation.(118) In order to ensure that\nthe regulatory framework can be adapted where necessary, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nupdating and annex listing the important products with digital elements\u258c.\nPower to adopt acts in accordance with that Article should be delegated to the\nCommission to identify products with digital elements covered by other Union\nrules which achieve the same level of protection as this Regulation,\nspecifying whether a limitation or exclusion from the scope of this Regulation\nwould be necessary as well as the scope of that limitation, if applicable.\nPower to adopt acts in accordance with that Article should also be delegated\nto the Commission in respect of the potential mandating of certification under\na European cybersecurity certification scheme of the critical products with\ndigital elements set out in an annex to this Regulation, as well as for\nupdating the list of critical products with digital elements based on\ncriticality criteria set out in this Regulation, and for specifying the\nEuropean cybersecurity certification schemes adopted pursuant to Regulation\n(EU) 2019/881 that can be used to demonstrate conformity with the essential\nrequirements or parts thereof as set out in an annex to this Regulation.Power\nto adopt delegated acts should also be delegated to the Commission to specify\nthe minimum support period for specific product categories where the market\nsurveillance data suggests inadequate support periods, as well as to specify\nthe terms and conditions for applying the cybersecurity related grounds in\nrelation to delaying the dissemination of notifications of actively exploited\nvulnerabilities. Furthermore, power to adopt delegated acts should be\ndelegated to the Commission to establish voluntary security attestation\nprogrammes for assessing the conformity of products with digital elements\nqualifying as free and open-source software with all or certain essential\nrequirements or other obligations laid down in this Regulation, as well as to\nspecify the minimum content of the EU declaration of conformity and to\nsupplement the elements to be included in the technical documentation. It is\nof particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate\nconsultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that\nthose consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down\nin the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-\nMaking(33).In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of\ndelegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents\nat the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts systematically\nhave access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the\npreparation of delegated acts. The power to adopt delegated acts pursuant to\nthis Regulation should be conferred on the Commission for a period\nuntil...[five years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation]. The\nCommission should draw up a report in respect of the delegation of power not\nlater than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation\nof power should be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration,\nunless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later\nthan three months before the end of each period.(119) In order to ensure\nuniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing\npowers should be conferred on the Commission to specify the technical\ndescription of the categories of important products with digital elements set\nout in an annex to this Regulation, specify the format and elements of the\nSBOM, specify further the \u258c format and procedure of the notifications of\nactively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents having an impact on\nthe security of products with digital elements submitted by manufacturers,\nestablish common specifications covering technical requirements that provide a\nmeans to comply with the essential requirements \u258cset out in an annex to this\nRegulation, \u258clay down technical specifications for labels, pictograms or any\nother marks related to the security of the products with digital elements,\ntheir support period and mechanisms to promote their use and to increase\npublic awareness about the security of products with digital elements, specify\nthe simplified documentation form targeted at the needs of microenterprises\nand small enterprises, and decide on corrective or restrictive measures at\nUnion level in exceptional circumstances which justify an immediate\nintervention to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market. Those\npowers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council(34).(120) In order to ensure\ntrusting and constructive cooperation of market surveillance authorities at\nUnion and national level, all parties involved in the application of this\nRegulation should respect the confidentiality of information and data obtained\nin carrying out their tasks.(121) In order to ensure effective enforcement of\nthe obligations laid down in this Regulation, each market surveillance\nauthority should have the power to impose or request the imposition of\nadministrative fines. Maximum levels for administrative fines to be provided\nfor in national law for non-compliance with the obligations laid down in this\nRegulation should therefore be established. When deciding on the amount of the\nadministrative fine in each individual case, all relevant circumstances of the\nspecific situation should be taken into account and, as a minimum, those\nexplicitly established in this Regulation, including whether the manufacturer\nis a microenterprise or a small or medium-sized enterprise, including a start-\nup, and whether administrative fines have been already applied by the same or\nother market surveillance authorities to the same economic operator for a\nsimilar infringement.Such circumstances could be either aggravating, in\nsituations where the infringement by the same economic operator persists on\nthe territory of Member States other than that where an administrative fine\nhas already been applied, or mitigating, in ensuring that any other\nadministrative fine considered by another market surveillance authority for\nthe same economic operator or the same type of infringement should already\ntake account, along with other relevant specific circumstances, of a penalty\nand the quantum thereof imposed in other Member States. In all such cases, the\ncumulative administrative fine that could be applied by market surveillance\nauthorities of several Member States to the same economic operator for the\nsame type of infringement should ensure the respect of the principle of\nproportionality. Given that administrative fines do not apply to\nmicroenterprises or small enterprises for a failure to meet the 24-hour\ndeadline for the early warning notification of actively exploited\nvulnerabilities or severe incidents having an impact on the security of the\nproduct with digital elements, nor to open-source software stewards for any\ninfringement of this Regulation, and subject to the principle that penalties\nshould be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, Member States should not\nimpose other kinds of penalties with pecuniary character on those\nentities.(122) Where administrative fines are imposed on a person that is not\nan undertaking, the competent authority should take account of the general\nlevel of income in the Member State as well as the economic situation of the\nperson when considering the appropriate amount of the fine. It should be for\nthe Member States to determine whether and to what extent public authorities\nshould be subject to administrative fines.(123) Member States should examine,\ntaking into account national circumstances, the possibility of using the\nrevenues from the penalties as provided for in this Regulation or their\nfinancial equivalent to support cybersecurity policies and increase the level\nof cybersecurity in the Union by, inter alia, increasing the number of\nqualified cybersecurity professionals, strengthening capacity building for\nmicroenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises and improving public\nawareness of cyber threats.(124) In its relationships with third countries,\nthe Union endeavours to promote international trade in regulated products. A\nbroad variety of measures can be applied in order to facilitate trade,\nincluding several legal instruments such as bilateral (inter-governmental)\nMutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) for conformity assessment and marking of\nregulated products. MRAs are established between the Union and third countries\nwhich are on a comparable level of technical development and have a compatible\napproach concerning conformity assessment. Those agreements are based on the\nmutual acceptance of certificates, marks of conformity and test reports issued\nby the conformity assessment bodies of either party in conformity with the\nlegislation of the other party. Currently, MRAs are in place with several\ncountries. Those MRAs are concluded in a number of specific sectors, which\nmight vary from one country to another. In order to further facilitate trade,\nand recognising that supply chains of products with digital elements are\nglobal, MRAs concerning conformity assessment can be concluded for products\nregulated under this Regulation by the Union in accordance with Article 218\nTFEU. Cooperation with partner countries is also important, in order to\nstrengthen cyber resilience globally, as in the long term this will contribute\nto a strengthened cybersecurity framework both within and outside of the\nUnion.(125) Consumers should be entitled to enforce their rights in relation\nto the obligations imposed on economic operators under this Regulation through\nrepresentative actions pursuant to Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European\nParliament and of the Council(35). For that purpose, this Regulation should\nprovide that Directive (EU) 2020/1828 is applicable to the representative\nactions concerning infringements of this Regulation that harm or can harm the\ncollective interests of consumers. Annex I to that Directive should therefore\nbe amended accordingly. It is for the Member States to ensure that those\namendments are reflected in the transposition measures adopted pursuant to\nthat Directive, although the adoption of national transposition measures in\nthat regard is not a condition for the applicability of that Directive to\nthose representative actions. The applicability of that Directive to the\nrepresentative actions brought with regard to infringements of provisions of\nthis Regulation by economic operators that harm or could harm the collective\ninterests of consumers should start from... [36 months from the date of entry\ninto force of this Regulation].(126) The Commission should periodically review\nthis Regulation, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, in particular\nwith a view to determining the need for modification in the light of changes\nto societal, political, technological or market conditions. This Regulation\nwill facilitate the compliance with supply chain security obligations of\nentities that fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 and Directive\n(EU) 2022/2555 that use products with digital elements. The Commission should\nevaluate, as part of that periodic review, the combined effects of the Union\ncybersecurity framework.(127) Economic operators should be provided with\nsufficient time to adapt to the requirements of this Regulation. This\nRegulation should apply from... [36 months from the date of its entry into\nforce]\u258c, with exception of the reporting obligations concerning actively\nexploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents having an impact on the\nsecurity of products with digital elements, which should apply from... [21\nmonths from the date of entry into force of this Regulation] and of the\nprovisions on notification of conformity assessment bodies, which should apply\nfrom... [18 months \u258c from the date of entry into force of this\nRegulation].(128) It is important to provide support to microenterprises and\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, including start-ups, in the implementation\nof this Regulation and to minimise the risks to the implementation resulting\nfrom lack of knowledge and expertise in the market, as well as in order to\nfacilitate compliance of manufacturers with their obligations laid down in\nthis Regulation. The Digital Europe Programme and other relevant Union\nprogrammes provide financial and technical support that enable those\nenterprises to contribute to the growth of the Union economy and to the\nstrengthening of the common level of cybersecurity in the Union. The European\nCybersecurity Competence Centre and National Coordination Centres as well as\nEuropean Digital Innovation Hubs established by the Commission and the Member\nStates at Union or national level could also support companies and public\nsector organisations and could contribute to the implementation of this\nRegulation. Within their respective missions and fields of competence, they\ncould provide technical and scientific support to microenterprises and small\nand medium sized enterprises, such as for testing activities and third-party\nconformity assessments. They could also foster the deployment of tools to\nfacilitate the implementation of this Regulation.(129) Furthermore, Member\nStates should consider taking complementary action aiming to provide guidance\nand support for microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, such\nas the establishment of regulatory sandboxes and dedicated channels for\ncommunication. In order to strengthen the level of cybersecurity in the Union,\nMember States may also consider providing support to develop capacity and\nskills related to cybersecurity of products with digital elements, improving\neconomic operators' cyber resilience, in particular of microenterprises and\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, and fostering public awareness about the\ncybersecurity of products with digital elements.(130) Since the objective of\nthis Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can\nrather, by reason of the effects of the action, be better achieved at Union\nlevel, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\naccordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article,\nthis Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that\nobjective.(131) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in\naccordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European\nParliament and of the Council(36) and delivered an opinion on 9 November\n2022(37),HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:CHAPTER IGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle\n1Subject matterThis Regulation lays down:(a) rules for the making available on\nthe market of products with digital elements to ensure the cybersecurity of\nsuch products;(b) essential requirements for the design, development and\nproduction of products with digital elements, and obligations for economic\noperators in relation to those products with respect to cybersecurity;(c)\nessential requirements for the vulnerability handling processes put in place\nby manufacturers to ensure the cybersecurity of products with digital elements\nduring the time the product is expected to be in use, and obligations for\neconomic operators in relation to those processes;(d) rules on market\nsurveillance, including monitoring, and enforcement of the rules and\nrequirements referred to in this Article.Article 2Scope1\\. This Regulation\napplies to products with digital elements made available on the market, the\nintended purpose or reasonably foreseeable use of which includes a direct or\nindirect logical or physical data connection to a device or network.2\\. This\nRegulation does not apply to products with digital elements to which the\nfollowing Union legal acts apply:(a) Regulation (EU) 2017/745;(b) Regulation\n(EU) 2017/746;(c) Regulation (EU) 2019/2144.3\\. This Regulation does not apply\nto products with digital elements that have been certified in accordance with\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1139.4\\. This Regulation does not apply to equipment that\nfalls within the scope of Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and\nof the Council(38).5\\. The application of this Regulation to products with\ndigital elements covered by other Union rules laying down requirements that\naddress all or some of the risks covered by the essential requirements set out\nin Annex I may be limited or excluded where:(a) such limitation or exclusion\nis consistent with the overall regulatory framework that applies to those\nproducts; and(b) the sectoral rules achieve the same or a higher level of\nprotection as that provided for by this Regulation.The Commission is empowered\nto adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to supplement this\nRegulation by specifying whether such limitation or exclusion is necessary,\nthe products and rules concerned, as well as the scope of the limitation, if\nrelevant.6\\. This Regulation does not apply to spare parts that are made\navailable on the market to replace identical components in products with\ndigital elements and that are manufactured according to the same\nspecifications as the components that they are intended to replace.7\\. This\nRegulation does not apply to products with digital elements developed or\nmodified exclusively for national security or defence purposes or to products\nspecifically designed to process classified information.8\\.

For the purposes of the notification\nreferred to in paragraph 1, the manufacturer shall submit:(a) an early warning\nnotification of an actively exploited vulnerability, without undue delay and\nin any event within 24 hours of the manufacturer becoming aware of it,\nindicating, where applicable, the Member States on the territory of which the\nmanufacturer is aware that their product with digital elements has been made\navailable;(b) unless the relevant information has already been provided, a\nvulnerability notification, without undue delay and in any event within 72\nhours of the manufacturer becoming aware of the actively exploited\nvulnerability, which shall provide general information, as available, about\nthe product with digital elements concerned, the general nature of the exploit\nand of the vulnerability concerned as well as any corrective or mitigating\nmeasures taken, and corrective or mitigating measures that users can take, and\nwhich shall also indicate, where applicable, how sensitive the manufacturer\ndeems the notified information to be;(c) unless the relevant information has\nalready been provided, a final report, no later than 14 days after a\ncorrective or mitigating measure is available, including at least the\nfollowing:(i) a description of the vulnerability, including its severity and\nimpact;(ii) where available, information concerning any malicious actor that\nhas exploited or that is exploiting the vulnerability;(iii) details about the\nsecurity update or other corrective measures that have been made available to\nremedy the vulnerability.3\\. A manufacturer shall \u258c notify \u258c any severe\nincident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements\nthat it becomes aware of simultaneously to the CSIRT designated as\ncoordinator, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article, and to ENISA. The\nmanufacturer shall notify that incident via the single reporting platform\nestablished pursuant to Article 16.4\\. For the purposes of the notification\nreferred to in paragraph 3, the manufacturer shall submit:(a) an early warning\nnotification of a severe incident having an impact on the security of the\nproduct with digital elements, without undue delay and in any event within 24\nhours of the manufacturer becoming aware of it, including at least whether the\nincident is suspected of being caused by unlawful or malicious acts, which\nshall also indicate, where applicable, the Member States on the territory of\nwhich the manufacturer is aware that their product with digital elements has\nbeen made available;(b) unless the relevant information has already been\nprovided, an incident notification, without undue delay and in any event\nwithin 72 hours of the manufacturer becoming aware of the incident, which\nshall provide general information, where available, about the nature of the\nincident, an initial assessment of the incident, as well as any corrective or\nmitigating measures taken, and corrective or mitigating measures that users\ncan take, and which shall also indicate, where applicable, how sensitive the\nmanufacturer deems the notified information to be;(c) unless the relevant\ninformation has already been provided, a final report, within one month after\nthe submission of the incident notification under point (b), including at\nleast the following:(i) a detailed description of the incident, including its\nseverity and impact;(ii) the type of threat or root cause that is likely to\nhave triggered the incident;(iii) applied and ongoing mitigation measures.5\\.\nFor the purposes of paragraph 3, an incident having an impact on the security\nof the product with digital elements shall be considered to be severe\nwhere:(a) it negatively affects or is capable of negatively affecting the\nability of a product with digital elements to protect the availability,\nauthenticity, integrity or confidentiality of sensitive or important data or\nfunctions; or(b) it has led or is capable of leading to the introduction or\nexecution of malicious code in a product with digital elements or in the\nnetwork and information systems of a user of the product with digital\nelements.6\\. Where necessary, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially\nreceiving the notification may request manufacturers to provide an\nintermediate report on relevant status updates about the actively exploited\nvulnerability or severe incident having an impact on the security of the\nproduct with digital elements.7\\. The notifications referred to in paragraphs\n1 and 3 of this Article shall be submitted via the single reporting platform\nreferred to in Article 16 using one of the electronic notification end-points\nreferred to in Article 16(1). The notification shall be submitted using the\nelectronic notification end-point of the CSIRT designated as coordinator of\nthe Member State where the manufacturers have their main establishment in the\nUnion and shall be simultaneously accessible to ENISA.For the purposes of this\nRegulation, a manufacturer shall be considered to have its main establishment\nin the Union, in the Member State where the decisions related to the\ncybersecurity of its products with digital elements are predominantly taken.\nIf such a Member State cannot be determined, the main establishment shall be\nconsidered to be in the Member State where the manufacturer concerned has the\nestablishment with the highest number of employees in the Union.Where a\nmanufacturer has no main establishment in the Union, it shall submit the\nnotifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 using the electronic\nnotification end-point of the CSIRT designated as coordinator in the Member\nState determined pursuant to the following order and based on the information\navailable to the manufacturer:(a) the Member State in which the authorised\nrepresentative acting on behalf of the manufacturer for the highest number of\nproducts with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;(b) the\nMember State in which the importer placing on the market the highest number of\nproducts with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;(c) the\nMember State in which the distributor making available on the market the\nhighest number of products with digital elements of that manufacturer is\nestablished;(d) the Member State in which the highest number of users of\nproducts with digital elements of that manufacturer are located.In relation to\nthe third subparagraph, point (d), a manufacturer may submit notifications\nrelated to any subsequent actively exploited vulnerability or severe incident\nhaving an impact on the security of the product with digital elements to the\nsame CSIRT designated as coordinator to which it first reported.\u258c8\\. \u258c After\nbecoming aware of an actively exploited vulnerability or a severe incident,\nthe manufacturer shall inform the impacted users of the product with digital\nelements, and where appropriate all users, about the actively exploited\nvulnerability or a severe incident having an impact on the security of the\nproduct with digital elements and, where necessary, about risk mitigation and\nany corrective measures that the users can deploy to mitigate the impact of\nthat vulnerability or incident, where appropriate in a structured and easily\nautomatically processible, machine-readable format. Where the manufacturer\nfails to inform the users of the product with digital elements in a timely\nmanner, the notified CSIRTs designated as coordinators may provide such\ninformation to the users when considered proportionate and necessary for\npreventing or mitigating the impact of that vulnerability or incident.9\\.\nBy... [12 months from the date of entry into force of this Regulation], the\nCommission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 61 to\nsupplement this Regulation by specifying the terms and conditions for applying\nthe cybersecurity related grounds in relation to delaying the dissemination of\nnotifications as referred to in Article 16(2). The Commission shall cooperate\nwith the CSIRTs network as established pursuant to Article 15 of Directive\n(EU) 2022/2555 and ENISA in preparing the draft delegated act.10\\. The\nCommission may, by means of implementing acts, specify further the format and\nprocedures of the notifications referred to in this Article as well as in\nArticles 15 and 16. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance\nwith the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2). The Commission\nshall cooperate with the CSIRTs network and ENISA in preparing those draft\nimplementing acts.\u258cArticle 15Voluntary reporting1\\. Manufacturers as well as\nother natural or legal persons may notify any vulnerability contained in a\nproduct with digital elements as well as cyber threats that could affect the\nrisk profile of a product with digital elements on a voluntary basis to a\nCSIRT designated as coordinator or ENISA.2\\. Manufacturers as well as other\nnatural or legal persons may notify any incident having an impact on the\nsecurity of the product with digital elements as well as near misses that\ncould have resulted in such an incident on a voluntary basis to a CSIRT\ndesignated as coordinator or ENISA.3\\. The CSIRT designated as coordinator or\nENISA shall process the notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\nthis Article in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16.The\nCSIRT designated as coordinator may prioritise the processing of mandatory\nnotifications over voluntary notifications.4\\. Where a natural or legal person\nother than the manufacturer notifies an actively exploited vulnerability or a\nsevere incident having an impact on the security of a product with digital\nelements in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2, the CSIRT designated as\ncoordinator shall without undue delay inform the manufacturer.5\\. The CSIRTs\ndesignated as coordinators as well as ENISA shall ensure the confidentiality\nand appropriate protection of the information provided by a notifying natural\nor legal person. Without prejudice to the prevention, investigation, detection\nand prosecution of criminal offences, voluntary reporting shall not result in\nthe imposition of any additional obligations upon a notifying natural or legal\nperson to which it would not have been subject had it not submitted the\nnotification.Article 16Establishment of a single reporting platform1\\. For the\npurposes of the notifications referred to in Article 14(1) and (3) and Article\n15(1) and (2) and in order to simplify the reporting obligations of\nmanufacturers, a single reporting platform shall be established by ENISA. The\nday-to-day operations of that single reporting platform shall be managed and\nmaintained by ENISA. The architecture of the single reporting platform shall\nallow Member States and ENISA to put in place their own electronic\nnotification end-points.2\\. After receiving a notification, the CSIRT\ndesignated as coordinator initially receiving the notification shall, without\ndelay, disseminate the notification via the single reporting platform to the\nCSIRTs designated as coordinators on the territory of which the manufacturer\nhas indicated that the product with digital elements has been made\navailable.In exceptional circumstances and, in particular, upon request by the\nmanufacturer and in light of the level of sensitivity of the notified\ninformation as indicated by the manufacturer under Article 14(2), point (a),\nof this Regulation, the dissemination of the notification may be delayed based\non justified cybersecurity related grounds for a period of time that is\nstrictly necessary, including where a vulnerability is subject to a\ncoordinated vulnerability disclosure procedure as referred to in Article 12(1)\nof Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Where a CSIRT decides to withhold a notification,\nit shall immediately inform ENISA about the decision and provide both a\njustification for withholding the notification as well as an indication of\nwhen it will disseminate the notification in accordance with the dissemination\nprocedure laid down in this paragraph. ENISA may support the CSIRT on the\napplication of cybersecurity related grounds in relation to delaying the\ndissemination of the notification.In particularly exceptional circumstances,\nwhere the manufacturer indicates in the notification referred to in Article\n14(2), point (b):(a) that the notified vulnerability has been actively\nexploited by a malicious actor and, according to the information available, it\nhas been exploited in no other Member State than the one of the CSIRT\ndesignated as coordinator to which the manufacturer has notified the\nvulnerability;(b) that any immediate further dissemination of the notified\nvulnerability would likely result in the supply of information the disclosure\nof which would be contrary to the essential interests of that Member State;\nor(c) that the notified vulnerability poses an imminent high cybersecurity\nrisk stemming from the further dissemination.Only the information that a\nnotification was made by the manufacturer, the general information about the\nproduct, the information on the general nature of the exploit and the\ninformation that security related grounds were raised are made available\nsimultaneously to ENISA until the full notification is disseminated to the\nCSIRTs concerned and ENISA. Where, based on that information, ENISA considers\nthat there is a systemic risk affecting security in the internal market, it\nshall recommend to the recipient CSIRT that it disseminate the full\nnotification to the other CSIRTs designated as coordinators and to ENISA\nitself.3\\. After receiving a notification of an actively exploited\nvulnerability in a product with digital elements or of a severe incident\nhaving an impact on the security of a product with digital elements, the\nCSIRTs designated as coordinators shall provide the market surveillance\nauthorities of their respective Member States with the notified information\nnecessary for the market surveillance authorities to fulfil their obligations\nunder this Regulation.4\\. ENISA shall take appropriate and proportionate\ntechnical, operational and organisational measures to manage the risks posed\nto the security of the single reporting platform and the information submitted\nor disseminated via the single reporting platform. It shall notify without\nundue delay any security incident affecting the single reporting platform to\nthe CSIRTs network as well as to the Commission.5\\. ENISA, in cooperation with\nthe CSIRTs network, shall provide and implement specifications on the\ntechnical, operational and organisational measures regarding the\nestablishment, maintenance and secure operation of the single reporting\nplatform referred to in paragraph 1, including at least the security\narrangements related to the establishment, operation and maintenance of the\nsingle reporting platform, as well as the electronic notification end-points\nset up by the CSIRTs designated as coordinators at national level and ENISA at\nUnion level, including procedural aspects to ensure that, where a notified\nvulnerability has no corrective or mitigating measures available, information\nabout that vulnerability is shared in line with strict security protocols and\non a need-to-know basis.6\\. Where a CSIRT designated as coordinator has been\nmade aware of an actively exploited vulnerability as part of a coordinated\nvulnerability disclosure procedure as referred to in Article 12(1) of\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially\nreceiving the notification may delay the dissemination of the relevant\nnotification via the single reporting platform based on justified\ncybersecurity related grounds for a period that is no longer than is strictly\nnecessary and until consent for disclosure by the involved coordinated\nvulnerability disclosure parties is given. That requirement shall not prevent\nmanufacturers from notifying such a vulnerability on a voluntary basis in\naccordance with the procedure laid down in this Article.Article 17Other\nprovisions related to reporting1\\. ENISA may submit to the European cyber\ncrisis liaison organisation network (EU-CyCLONe) established under Article 16\nof Directive (EU) 2022/2555 information notified pursuant to Article 14(1) and\n(3) and Article 15(1) and (2) if such information is relevant for the\ncoordinated management of large-scale cybersecurity incidents and crises at an\noperational level. For the purpose of determining such relevance, ENISA may\nconsider technical analyses performed by the CSIRTs network, where\navailable.2\\. Where public awareness is necessary to prevent or mitigate a\nsevere incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital\nelements or to handle an ongoing incident, or where disclosure of the incident\nis otherwise in the public interest, the CSIRT designated as coordinator of\nthe relevant Member State, may, after consulting the manufacturer concerned\nand, where appropriate, in cooperation with ENISA, inform the public about the\nincident or require the manufacturer to do so.3\\. ENISA, on the basis of the\nnotifications received pursuant to Article 14(1) and (3) and Article 15(1) and\n(2), shall prepare, every 24 months, a technical report on emerging trends\nregarding cybersecurity risks in products with digital elements and submit it\nto the Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 14 of Directive (EU)\n2022/2555. The first such report shall be submitted within 24 months after the\nobligations laid down in Article 14(1) and (3) start applying. ENISA shall\ninclude relevant information from its technical reports in its report on the\nstate of cybersecurity in the Union pursuant to Article 18 of Directive (EU)\n2022/2555.4\\. The mere act of notification in accordance with Article 14(1)\nand (3) or Article 15(1) and (2) shall not subject the notifying natural or\nlegal person to increased liability.5\\. After a security update or another\nform of corrective or mitigating measure is available, ENISA shall, in\nagreement with the manufacturer of the product with digital elements\nconcerned, add the publicly known vulnerability notified pursuant to Article\n14(1) or Article 15(1) of this Regulation to the European vulnerability\ndatabase established pursuant to Article 12(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.6\\.\nThe CSIRTs designated as coordinators shall provide helpdesk support in\nrelation to the reporting obligations pursuant to Article 14 to manufacturers\nand in particular manufacturers that qualify as microenterprises or as small\nor medium-sized enterprises.Article 18Authorised representatives1\\. A\nmanufacturer may, by a written mandate, appoint an authorised\nrepresentative.2\\. The obligations laid down in Article 13(1) to (12), first\nsubparagraph, and (14) shall not form part of the authorised representative's\nmandate.3\\. An authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in\nthe mandate received from the manufacturer. The authorised representative\nshall provide a copy of the mandate to the market surveillance authorities\nupon request. The mandate shall allow the authorised representative to do at\nleast the following:(a) keep the EU declaration of conformity referred to in\nArticle 28 and the technical documentation referred to in Article 31 at the\ndisposal of the market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after\nthe product with digital elements has been placed on the market or for the\nsupport period, whichever is longer;(b) further to a reasoned request from a\nmarket surveillance authority, provide that authority with all the information\nand documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product with\ndigital elements;(c) cooperate with the market surveillance authorities, at\ntheir request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by a product\nwith digital elements covered by the authorised representative's\nmandate.Article 19Obligations of importers1\\. Importers shall place on the\nmarket only products with digital elements that comply with the essential\nrequirements set out in Annex I, Part I, and where the processes put in place\nby the manufacturer comply with the essential requirements set out in Annex I,\nPart II.2\\.

Where the market surveillance authority of a\nMember State has sufficient reason to consider that a product with digital\nelements, including its vulnerability handling, presents a significant\ncybersecurity risk, it shall, without undue delay and, where appropriate, in\ncooperation with the relevant CSIRT, carry out an evaluation of the product\nwith digital elements concerned in respect of its compliance with all the\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators\nshall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority.Where, in\nthe course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that\nthe product with digital elements does not comply with the requirements laid\ndown in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant economic\noperator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the product with\ndigital elements into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw it from\nthe market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the\nnature of the cybersecurity risk, as the market surveillance authority may\nprescribe.The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified\nbody accordingly. Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the \u258c\ncorrective actions.2\\. When determining the significance of a cybersecurity\nrisk referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the market surveillance\nauthorities shall also consider non-technical risk factors, in particular\nthose established as a result of Union level coordinated security risk\nassessments of critical supply chains carried out in accordance with Article\n22 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Where a market surveillance authority has\nsufficient reason to consider that a product with digital elements presents a\nsignificant cybersecurity risk in light of non-technical risk factors, it\nshall inform the competent authorities designated or established pursuant to\nArticle 8 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and cooperate with those authorities as\nnecessary.3\\. Where the market surveillance authority considers that non-\ncompliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the\nCommission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of\nthe actions which it has required the economic operator to take.4\\. The\neconomic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken\nin respect of all the products with digital elements concerned that it has\nmade available on the market throughout the Union.5\\. Where the economic\noperator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred\nto in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the market surveillance authority\nshall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict that\nproduct with digital elements from being made available on its national\nmarket, to withdraw it from that market or to recall it.That authority shall\nnotify the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those\nmeasures.6\\. The information referred to in paragraph 5 shall include all\navailable details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of\nthe non-compliant product with digital elements, the origin of that product\nwith digital elements, the nature of the alleged non-compliance and the risk\ninvolved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the\narguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the\nmarket surveillance authority shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due\nto one or more of the following:(a) a failure of the product with digital\nelements or of the processes put in place by the manufacturer to meet the\nessential requirements set out in Annex I;(b) shortcomings in the harmonised\nstandards, European cybersecurity certification schemes, or common\nspecifications, referred to in Article 27.7\\. The market surveillance\nauthorities of the Member States other than the market surveillance authority\nof the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the\nCommission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any\nadditional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the\nproduct with digital elements concerned, and, in the event of disagreement\nwith the notified national measure, of their objections.8\\. Where, within\nthree months of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 5 of this\nArticle, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the\nCommission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that\nmeasure shall be deemed justified. This is without prejudice to the procedural\nrights of the economic operator concerned in accordance with Article 18 of\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020.9\\. The market surveillance authorities of all\nMember States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken in\nrespect of the product with digital elements concerned, such as withdrawal of\nthat product from their market, without delay.Article 55Union safeguard\nprocedure1\\. Where, within three months of receipt of the notification\nreferred to in Article 54(5), objections are raised by a Member State against\na measure taken by another Member State, or where the Commission considers the\nmeasure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall without delay enter\ninto consultation with the relevant Member State and the economic operator or\noperators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results\nof that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure\nis justified or not within nine months from the notification referred to in\nArticle 54(5) and notify that decision to the Member State concerned.2\\. If\nthe national measure is considered to be justified, all Member States shall\ntake the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant product with\ndigital elements is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the\nCommission accordingly. If the national measure is not considered to be\njustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.3\\. Where the\nnational measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product\nwith digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised\nstandards, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11\nof Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.4\\. Where the national measure is considered\njustified and the non-compliance of the product with digital elements is\nattributed to shortcomings in a European cybersecurity certification scheme as\nreferred to in Article 27, the Commission shall consider whether to amend or\nrepeal delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 27(9) that specifies the\npresumption of conformity concerning that certification scheme.5\\. Where the\nnational measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product\nwith digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in common specifications\nas referred to in Article 27, the Commission shall consider whether to amend\nor repeal any implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 27(2) setting out\nthose common specifications.Article 56Procedure at Union level concerning\nproducts with digital elements presenting a significant cybersecurity risk1\\.\nWhere the Commission has sufficient reason to consider, including based on\ninformation provided by ENISA, that a product with digital elements that\npresents a significant cybersecurity risk does not comply with the\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall inform the relevant market\nsurveillance authorities. Where the market surveillance authorities carry out\nan evaluation of that product with digital elements that may present a\nsignificant cybersecurity risk in respect of its compliance with the\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation, the procedures referred to in\nArticles 54 and 55 shall apply.2\\. Where the Commission has sufficient reason\nto consider that a product with digital elements presents a significant\ncybersecurity risk in light of non-technical risk factors, it shall inform the\nrelevant market surveillance authorities and, where appropriate, the competent\nauthorities designated or established pursuant to Article 8 of Directive (EU)\n2022/2555 and cooperate with those authorities as necessary. The Commission\nshall also consider the relevance of the identified risks for that product\nwith digital elements in view of its tasks regarding the Union level\ncoordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains provided for\nin Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, and consult as necessary the\nCooperation Group established pursuant to Article 14 of Directive (EU)\n2022/2555 and ENISA.3\\. In \u258c circumstances which justify an immediate\nintervention to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market and\nwhere the Commission has sufficient reason to consider that the product with\ndigital elements referred to in paragraph 1 remains non-compliant with the\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation and no effective measures have been\ntaken by the relevant market surveillance authorities, the Commission shall\ncarry out an evaluation of compliance and may request ENISA to provide an\nanalysis to support it. The Commission shall inform the relevant market\nsurveillance authorities accordingly. The relevant economic operators shall\ncooperate as necessary with ENISA.4\\. Based on the evaluation referred to in\nparagraph 3, the Commission may decide that a corrective or restrictive\nmeasure is necessary at Union level. To that end, it shall without delay\nconsult the Member States concerned and the relevant economic operator or\noperators.5\\. On the basis of the consultation referred to in paragraph 3 of\nthis Article, the Commission may adopt implementing acts to provide for\ncorrective or restrictive measures at Union level, including requiring the\nrelevant products with digital elements to be withdrawn from the market or\nrecalled, within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the\nrisk. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the\nexamination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).6\\. The Commission shall\nimmediately communicate the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 5 to\nthe relevant economic operator or operators. Member States shall implement\nthose implementing acts without delay and shall inform the Commission\naccordingly.7\\. Paragraphs 3 to 6 shall be applicable for the duration of the\nexceptional situation that justified the Commission\u2019s intervention, provided\nthat the product with digital elements concerned is not brought in compliance\nwith this Regulation.Article 57Compliant products with digital elements which\npresent a significant cybersecurity risk1\\. \u258cThe market surveillance authority\nof a Member State shall require an economic operator to take all appropriate\nmeasures where, having performed an evaluation under Article 54, it finds that\nalthough a product with digital elements and the processes put in place by the\nmanufacturer are in compliance with this Regulation, it presents a significant\ncybersecurity risk as well as a risk to:(a) the health or safety of\npersons;(b) the compliance with obligations under Union or national law\nintended to protect fundamental rights;(c) the availability, authenticity,\nintegrity or confidentiality of services offered using an electronic\ninformation system by essential entities referred to in Article 3(1) of\nDirective (EU) 2022/2555; or(d) other aspects of public interest\nprotection.The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may include\nmeasures to ensure that the product with digital elements concerned and the\nprocesses put in place by the manufacturer no longer present the relevant\nrisks when made available on the market, withdrawal from the market of the\nproduct with digital elements concerned, or recalling of it, and shall be\ncommensurate with the nature of those risks.2\\. The manufacturer or other\nrelevant economic operators shall ensure that corrective action is taken in\nrespect of the products with digital elements concerned that they have made\navailable on the market throughout the Union within the timeline established\nby the market surveillance authority of the Member State referred to in\nparagraph 1.3\\. The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and\nthe other Member States about the measures taken pursuant to paragraph 1. That\ninformation shall include all available details, in particular the data\nnecessary for the identification of the products with digital elements\nconcerned, the origin and the supply chain of those products with digital\nelements, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the\nnational measures taken.4\\. The Commission shall without delay enter into\nconsultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator and\nshall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of\nthat evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified\nor not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures.5\\. The Commission\nshall address the decision referred to in paragraph 4 to the Member States.6\\.\nWhere the Commission has sufficient reason to consider, including based on\ninformation provided by ENISA, that a product with digital elements, although\ncompliant with this Regulation, presents the risks referred to in paragraph 1\nof this Article, it shall inform and may request the relevant market\nsurveillance authority or authorities to carry out an evaluation \u258cand follow\nthe procedures referred to in Article 54 and paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this\nArticle.7\\. In \u258c circumstances which justify an immediate intervention to\npreserve the proper functioning of the internal market and where the\nCommission has sufficient reason to consider that the product with digital\nelements referred to in paragraph 6 continues to present the risks referred to\nin paragraph 1, and no effective measures have been taken by the relevant\nnational market surveillance authorities, the Commission shall carry out an\nevaluation of the risks presented by that product with digital elements and\nmay request ENISA to provide an analysis to support that evaluation and shall\ninform the relevant market surveillance authorities accordingly. The relevant\neconomic operators shall cooperate as necessary with ENISA.8\\. Based on the\nevaluation referred to in paragraph 7, the Commission may establish that a\ncorrective or restrictive measure is necessary at Union level. To that end, it\nshall without delay consult the Member States concerned and the relevant\neconomic operator or operators.9\\. On the basis of the consultation referred\nto in paragraph 8, the Commission may adopt implementing acts to decide on\ncorrective or restrictive measures at Union level, including requiring the\nrelevant products with digital elements to be withdrawn from the market, or\nrecalled, within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the\nrisk. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the\nexamination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).10\\. The Commission shall\nimmediately communicate the implementing acts referred to in \u258c paragraph 9 to\nthe relevant economic operator or operators. Member States shall implement\nthose implementing acts without delay and shall inform the Commission\naccordingly.11\\. Paragraphs 6 to 10 shall apply for the duration of the\nexceptional situation that justified the Commission\u2019s intervention and for as\nlong as the product with digital elements concerned continues to present the\nrisks referred to in paragraph 1.Article 58Formal non-compliance1\\.
