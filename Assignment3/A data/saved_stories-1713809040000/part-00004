Containing\nanywhere from 100 billion to 400 billion stars (and by extension trillions of\nplanets), the Milky Way is a stunning 100,000 light years across. That means a\ntrans-galactic photon that just exited the Milky Way today likely began its\njourney when Homo sapiens had yet to migrate out of Africa, and that\u2019s\ntraveling at roughly 670 million miles per hour. Considering the velocity\nlimitations of our rockets, it takes roughly half a human lifetime just to\nexit our solar system.\n\nSimply put, if humans want to be a spacefaring species, we\u2019re going to need\nsomething better than chemical \u2014 or even nuclear \u2014 rockets, and for decades,\nit\u2019s science fiction that has held the answer. The most famous example is Star\nTrek, which relies on the power of its warp drive to traverse the galaxy in a\nfraction of the time. Galactic journeys that once took centuries could now be\nwrapped up in a couple of hours.\n\nScientists have longed for some sort of technology that can propel humans\nfaster than what physics says is possible, and now a new online tool is\nhelping engineers make a warp drive the sole property of Starfleet. Last week,\nApplied Physics, which is an international group of scientists and engineers,\nannounced that they\u2019d created an online toolkit for \u201canalyzing warp drive\nspacetimes\u201d called the \u201cWarp Factory.\u201d\n\nThis comes only a few years after a flurry of papers reported that\nconstructing warp drives \u2014 built on the idea of spacetime-folding warp bubbles\n\u2014 could be theoretically possible. Warp Factory provides an online playground\nfor researchers to test warp engine ideas.\n\n\u201cPhysicists can now generate and refine an array of warp drive designs with\njust a few clicks, allowing us to advance science at warp speed,\" Gianni\nMartire, CEO of Applied Physics, said in a press statement. \u201cWarp Factory\nserves as a virtual wind tunnel, enabling us to test and evaluate different\nwarp designs. Science fiction is now inching closer to science fact.\u201d\n\nAs Public Benefit Company, Applied Physics is ponying up $500,000 in potential\ngrants for aspiring warp drive theorists. However, those grants come with a\nfew caveats, mainly that the idea is to produce a physical warp drive based in\nclassical relativity, which means not relying on \u201cnegative energy or\nsuperluminal matter\u201d to make your time-bending engine work.\n\nAP\u2019s Christopher Helmerich, in an interview with The Debrief, also compared\nthe Warp Factory as a \u201creality check\u201d for warp drives as concepts can be\nanalyzed in a comprehensive way and hopefully weed out ideas that have no\nchance of operating in the real world.\n\nWhile a fully working warp drives has many hurdles to overcome, it\u2019s a\ntechnology worth taking seriously. Because if humans have any hope of one day\nexploring distant stars, it\u2019ll need the help of space-bending tech that the\nnewly-minted Warp Factory hopes to nurture.\n\nDarren Orf\n\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our\nworld works.
