The backdoor expects a certain type of RSA public key, badkeys can detect these now. This detection can theoretically lead to false positives, however, the false positive rate is low enough (~1:2^62) that it will likely never show up in practice.\n  * Move from setup.py/setup.cfg to pyproject.toml.\n  * Avoid installing the \"tests\" dir in the wheel.\n  * Avoid open_binary() deprecation warning and use new files() API. This raises the required Python version to 3.9.\n\n2 people reacted\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
