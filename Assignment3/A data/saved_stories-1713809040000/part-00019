This isn't a useful goal. you could simply distribute a\nzip containing an .exe and a weights file together. Or better still: Decouple\nthe program that runs these chatbots from the chatbot weights.\n\nImagine if PNG files were also an executable that could pop open a window that\ndisplays a PNG on your computer. There is a reason we don't do this: It's not\ngood engineering.\n\nThere is a claim that llamafile is simpler or more convenient, because it's\none thing. But it's actually not hard to download two things: an .exe for\nwindows or mac or whatever and an LLM binary.\n\nAnd honestly having your executable contain so much random looking binary data\ndoes not seem like a good choice in terms of security either.\n\nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
