It is the\nbest choice for its price and it gives you the opportunity to learn and deploy\nyour own skills in its framework. I am looking forward to expand its abilities\nby using its expansion modules and hopefully waiting for a module with camera\nthat will transmit video in real time, so I can use it in exploring a space\nthat it is not possible for a human to enter. Finally I want to thank and\ncongratulate the whole support team for the kind and quick help they provided\nme during the implementation period.\n\nB\n\nBenjamin\n\nVery well made product, for me this is very good for uni considering the\ncourse I am doing which is robotics. Lots of room for adaptability such as\nadding sensors, with flexible options for programming python and C language.\nThis is also great because it gives the option to intergrate your own Ai.\nPersonally would not get this product if you don't want to learn how to\nprogram and just use the included built in functions on the app, can get a bit\nboring after a while. However for someone like me who is studying robotics and\nengineering design and wants to learn how it works and functions with room for\nadaptability. This is a truly best bionic dog that you can get for the price,\njust note it will take about 3 to 4 weeks to be delivered to your door.\n\nJ\n\nJacob\n\nLove it but didn\u2019t see a charger with it\n\nLoad More\n\n## Petoi\n\n  * About us\n  * Contact us\n  * Partnership\n  * Affiliate program\n  * Blog\n  * Get 10% OFF by referral\n\n## Where to buy\n\n  * Official Store\n  * Amazon\n  * Robotshop\n\n## Support\n\n  * Compare our robots\n  * Gift ideas for geeks, coders & engineers\n  * Valentine gifts for programmers & geeks\n  * STEM gift ideas for kids & teenagers\n  * Best Raspberry Pi Robot Kits\n  * Best quadruped for developers\n  * Shipping & returns\n  * FAQs\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Terms of service\n\nEnglish (United States)\n\nPayment methods\n\n\u00a9 2018-2024 , Petoi LLC\n\n  * Choosing a selection results in a full page refresh.\n\n\u00d7\n\n", "frontpage": false}
