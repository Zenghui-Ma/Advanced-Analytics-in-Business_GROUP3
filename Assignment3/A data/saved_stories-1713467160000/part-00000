Then\nthere's the Mario series, where every person credited with the creation of the\noriginal Super Mario Bros. in the 1980s ended up having a role in the making\nof Super Mario Bros. Wonder just last year.\n\nIn a recent interview with Ars Technica, Wonder producer Takashi Tezuka said\nit wasn't that tough to get that kind of creative continuity at Nintendo. \"The\nsecret to having a long-tenured staff is that people don't quit,\" he said.\n\"For folks who have been there together for such a long time, it's easy for us\nto talk to each other.\"\n\n## Artistic memories\n\nWhen asked about his favorite Mario game, Tezuka said he had a soft spot for\nSuper Mario Bros. 3, partly because \"in addition to overall game design, I was\nalso doing artwork.\" After that game, though, he stopped working on the visual\nart side because \"there were just a lot of people that were better than me,\"\nhe said.\n\nThat said, Tezuka added that just getting a bunch of industry veterans\ntogether to make a game runs the risk of not \"keeping up with the times.\nReally, for me, I have a great interest in how our newer staff members play,\nwhat they play, what they think, and what is appealing to them. I think it's\nvery interesting the things we can come up with when these two disparate\ngroups influence each other to create something.\"\n\n## Young and old\n\n### Further Reading\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder devs created 2,000 game-altering \u201cWonder Effect\u201d\nideas\n\nFor Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the development team solicited literally\nthousands of ideas for potential game-changing Wonder Effects and badges from\nacross Nintendo. In doing so, the game was able to incorporate the viewpoints\nof people with a wide variety of histories and memories of the series, Tezuka\ntold Ars.\n\n  * Super Mario Bros. Wonder Producer Takashi Tezuka.\n\nNintendo\n\n  * Super Mario Bros. Wonder Director Shiro Mouri.\n\nNintendo\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\n\"Among our staff, there are folks who actually maybe haven't played some of\nthe [older] game titles we're talking about,\" he said. \"So I think there was\nsome familiarization for those folks with some of those titles. And maybe\nthere was some inspiration drawn from those titles that I'm not aware of.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a series as long-running as Mario, though, even some of the relatively\n\"younger\" development cohort can have a deep history with the series. Super\nMario Bros. Wonder Director Shiro Mouri, who joined Nintendo in 1997, recalled\nplaying the original Super Mario Bros. back in elementary school, and being\n\"so moved and awed by the secrets and mysteries I discovered in that game.\"\nThe Wonder Effects in Wonder were an explicit attempt to recapture that\nfeeling of being young and discovering new things for the first time, which\ncan be difficult in such an established series.\n\nMouri also drew some parallels between Yoshi's Island\u2014where Yoshi could\nsometimes turn into a vehicle\u2014and Wonder transformation effects that could\nturn the player into slime or a spiky ball, for instance. \"That's not to say\nthat we drew [direct] inspiration from [Yoshi's Island] or anything, but I\nthink... providing surprises has always been a theme throughout our\nphilosophy,\" he said.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n42\n\nKyle Orland Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica\nsince 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind\nvideo games.

Basically, not treating employees\nlike disposable commodities.\n\nThat is genuinely uncommon nowadays.\n\nApril 17, 2024 at 5:11 pm\n\njjmorris2000\n\nThere are criticisms that can be made of Nintendo as a company, but the way\nthey treat their employees isn't one of them. Their leadership is promoted\nfrom within, and as far as I know they've never done things like \"10% across\nthe board layoffs\" to please their investors. I strongly suspect that these\ntwo things are connected.\n\nApril 17, 2024 at 5:21 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Unsolved Mysteries Of Quantum Leap With Donald P.
