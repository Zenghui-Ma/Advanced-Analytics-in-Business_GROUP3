Indeed seasonally adjusts each\nseries based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series,\nincluding the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national\ngeographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. Indeed switched to this new\nmethodology in December 2022 and now reports all historical data using this\nnew methodology. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ\nsignificantly from originally reported values. The new methodology applies a\ndetrended seasonal adjustment factor to the index change in job postings.
