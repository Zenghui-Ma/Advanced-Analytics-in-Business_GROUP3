To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the\nFront Conference in 2011. To create great digital products, we rely on each\nother: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came\nup with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and\nimplementation of a front end. We also cover management topics such as design\nleadership, tech governance and UX strategy. Our attendees range from juniors\nto managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their\nknowledge in talks and workshops. The conference has become a place to learn\nand network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.\n\nChris Adams: Building the Web in a Climate Emergency // #FrontZurich 2021\n\n33:30\n\nFront Conference Zurich\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\nShare\n\nAn error occurred while retrieving sharing information.
