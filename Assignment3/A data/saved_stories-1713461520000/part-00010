We ship pnpm bundled with\nNode.js. This means that regardless of which Node.js version you've installed,\npnpm will operate using the necessary Node.js runtime. For this to work you\nneed to install pnpm either using the standalone script or install the\n@pnpm/exe package.\n\n  * Configuration updates:\n\n    * dedupe-injected-deps: enabled by default.\n    * link-workspace-packages: disabled by default. This means that by default, dependencies will be linked from workspace packages only when they are specified using the workspace protocol.\n    * hoist-workspace-packages: enabled by default.\n    * enable-pre-post-scripts: enabled by default.\n    * Use the same directory for state files on macOS as on Linux (~/.local/state/pnpm).\n    * pnpm will now check the package.json file for a packageManager field. If this field is present and specifies a different package manager or a different version of pnpm than the one you're currently using, pnpm will not proceed. This ensures that you're always using the correct package manager and version that the project requires.\n  * Lockfile changes:\n\n    * Lockfile v9 is adopted. This new format has changes for better readability, and better resistence to Git conflicts.\n    * Support for lockfile v5 is dropped. Use pnpm v8 to convert lockfile v5 to lockfile v6 #7470.\n  * Dependency resolution changes:\n\n    * Correct resolution of peer dependencies that have their own peer dependencies. Related issue: #7444. Related PR: #7606.\n    * Optional peer dependencies may be resolved from any packages in the dependency graph #7830.\n  * pnpm licenses list prints license information of all versions of the same package in case different versions use different licenses. The format of the pnpm licenses list --json output has been changed #7528.\n\n  * A new command added for printing completion code to the console: pnpm completion [shell]. The old command that modified the user's shell dotfiles has been removed #3083.\n\n  * When installing git-hosted dependencies, only pick the files that would be packed with the package #7638.\n\n## Minor Changes\n\n  * It is now possible to install only a subdirectory from a Git repository.\n\nFor example, pnpm add github:user/repo#path:packages/foo will add a dependency\nfrom the packages/foo subdirectory.\n\nThis new parameter may be combined with other supported parameters separated\nby &. For instance, the next command will install the same package from the\ndev branch: pnpm add github:user/repo#dev&path:packages/bar.\n\nRelated issue: #4765. Related PR: #7487.\n\n  * node-gyp updated to version 10.\n\n  * PowerShell completion support added #7597.\n\n  * Support node-options option inside .npmrc file when running scripts #7596.\n\n  * Added support for registry-scoped SSL configurations (cert, key, and ca). Three new settings supported: <registryURL>:certfile, <registryURL>:keyfile, and <registryURL>:ca. For instance:\n    \n        //registry.mycomp.com/:certfile=server-cert.pem //registry.mycomp.com/:keyfile=server-key.pem //registry.mycomp.com/:cafile=client-cert.pem\n\nRelated issue: #7427. Related PR: #7626.\n\n  * Add a field named ignoredOptionalDependencies. This is an array of strings. If an optional dependency has its name included in this array, it will be skipped #7714.\n\n  * The checksum of the .pnpmfile.cjs is saved into the lockfile. If the pnpmfile gets modified, the lockfile is reanalyzed to apply the changes #7662.\n\n  * Added cache for pnpm dlx #5277.\n\n## Patch Changes\n\n  * Package tarballs are not downloaded during --lockfile-only installation #1328.\n  * Peer dependency rules should only affect reporting, not data in the lockfile #7758.\n  * Link overrides should be able to use absolute path #7749.\n  * pnpm dlx should not read settings from the current working directory #7916.\n\n## Platinum Sponsors\n\n## Gold Sponsors\n\n## Our Silver Sponsors\n\n115 people reacted\n\n0 Join discussion\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
