On Wednesday evening local time, the\nvolcano\u2019s eruption shot ash nearly 70,000 feet high, possibly spewing aerosols\ninto the stratosphere, the atmosphere\u2019s second layer.\n\nThe volcano is part of Indonesia\u2019s North Sulawesi province, in the Sangihe\nIslands archipelago. That puts it about 60 miles north-northeast of Manado,\nthe province\u2019s capital.\n\nVideo filmed April 17 shows Mount Ruang spewing fiery lava, accompanied by\nlightning strikes. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post)\n\nIndonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency posted on X that the situation\ncorresponded to a Level 3 on a 1-through-4 scale, with 4 being the most\nsevere.\n\nIn Laingpatehi village, there were reports of ash fall and communication\nissues. Indonesian authorities urged residents and tourists to remain at least\n4 kilometers, or 2.5 miles, away from the volcano.\n\nSatellite imagery depicted a massive eruption around 8 p.m. Wednesday local\ntime, which shot ash about 65,000 to 70,000 feet high. That\u2019s roughly twice\nthe altitude at which commercial aircraft fly.\n\nThere are nine formal centers worldwide that monitor the location and movement\nof volcanic ash clouds, because they can pose major dangers to aviation and\ncannot be tracked on radar. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin,\nAustralia, which is overseen by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, wrote\nthat there were \u201ctwo volcanic ash layers discernible on satellite [at the\nsurface and 47,000 feet] moving west-southwest and expected to dissipate\nwithin 12 to 18 hours.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAt the surface, ash was moving northwest, but at the upper altitudes, it was\nmoving east.\n\nThe eruption produced prolific lightning, as is often the case with volcanic\nexplosions. Friction between ash particulates results in charge separation,\nyielding static discharges in the form of lightning.\n\nChris Vagasky, manager of the Wisconsin Environmental Mesonet, a network of\nweather and soil monitoring stations across the state, reported that nearly\n4,000 lightning strikes had been detected associated with the Ruang eruption\nas of 8 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe plot image he shared on X may resemble a bull\u2019s eye of sorts, with an\napparent ring of slightly lesser activity observed between a central dense\nspattering of strikes and a dense outer ring of observed strikes. Why the\ndrop-off in between? This was probably a region of subsidence, or sinking air.\nAs the volcanic plume ascended rapidly, pockets of heated air and ash collided\nwith the tropopause, or the \u201cceiling\u201d of the lower atmosphere; while some of\nthe momentum probably continued upward, potentially injecting aerosols into\nthe stratosphere, some of the momentum was reflected back downward. That\ncreated a local minimum in lightning activity. (Farther outward radially, it\nappears that the sinking air then heated up and began rising again.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThat was observed during the January 2022 eruption of the Tonga volcano Hunga\nTonga, which by some reports sparked more than 400,000 lightning strikes.\n\nRuang\u2019s massive plume can be seen on infrared satellite; after the initial\nblast, notice the slightly lighter colors, corresponding to warmer and lower\ncloud tops, on the west side of the plume. That is from subsidence.\n\nThe summit of Ruang stands 10,932 feet above sea level, with a caldera that is\nabout two miles wide. Eruptions are relatively common, though explosions this\nhigh are rare.\n\nWhen volcanic aerosols make it into the stratosphere, they can have minute\neffects on Earth\u2019s climate. The stratosphere begins around 20,000 feet above\nthe ground at the poles, but 60,000 feet or so in the tropics. It is too early\nto know how much material, if any, made it into the stratosphere, which is\nabove the troposphere, or the lowest layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Weather\noccurs primarily in the troposphere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nD.C. region\n\nLocal news, weather, sports, events, restaurants and more\n\nFrom the start, Spencer Carbery believed in his Caps.
