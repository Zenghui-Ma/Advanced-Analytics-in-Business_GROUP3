Some, according to a\nWall Street Journal report, are forbidden from government jobs and denied\npricier insurance policies, vacations, and even nice hotels.\n\nOutstanding debtors are placed on a government delinquency blacklist.\nInformally, these people are referred to as \"laolai\" \u2014 roughly translated,\n\"deadbeat debtors.\" And the number of names on the list is about 8.3 million,\naccording to the Journal \u2014 a jump of nearly 50% since 2019.\n\nIt's not just formal restrictions they face; some phone companies in China\nhave gone as far as assigning special ringtones to debtors to warn other\npeople that they are talking to someone on the brink of insolvency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, procedures for personal insolvency in China are few and far between.\nUnlike most other countries, China doesn't allow most people to write off\ntheir debts with bankruptcy, per the Journal.\n\nInstead, the Chinese government can take steps like seizing a debtor's income\nas restitution, leaving them with a small allowance so they can cover living\nexpenses.\n\nThat isn't always enough, though, as one man found when he petitioned to raise\nhis monthly income allowance to help pay for a newborn child. Rather than\napproving the increase to 12,000 yuan, or approximately $1,600, the Journal\nreported that the court cut his allowance by nearly 40%.\n\nIn China, a country that traditionally values saving, some consider borrowing\nmoney to be taboo. That's backed by a 2021 study, which noted that in Chinese\nsociety, \"many still view bankruptcy as a vehicle for feckless shirkers to\nescape their debts.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's left many debtors feeling trapped by the system, which can make it\nincreasingly difficult for them to pay off seemingly insurmountable\nliabilities.\n\nChina's debtor blacklist is technically separate from its \"social credit\nsystem,\" but both have similar functions \u2014 namely, tracking individual\nbehavior and rewarding or punishing people for it.\n\nThe system, which is not yet fully implemented, has penalized citizens for\neverything from social media posts to jaywalking. The worst offenders may face\ntrouble getting loans and travel restrictions \u2014 similar to the experience of\nblacklisted debtors.\n\nThe Chinese economy has slumped after exiting the pandemic. Researchers have\nwarned of a \"debt-deflation spiral\" that could make the situation for Chinese\nhouseholds even worse.\n\nCamilo Fonseca\n\nTech/Trending News Reporter\n\nCamilo Fonseca is an editorial fellow with Business Insider, on the tech and\ntrending news desk.
