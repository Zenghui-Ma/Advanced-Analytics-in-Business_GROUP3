It allows the user to quickly return to the top of\nthe page. This is useful for websites that have a lot of content and want to\nmake it easier for users to navigate back to the top.\n\nUse cases:\n\n  * Blogs: A blog may have a scroll to top button to help users navigate back to the top of the page.\n  * E-commerce: An e-commerce website may have a scroll to top button to help users navigate back to the top of the page.\n  * Landing pages: A landing page may have a scroll to top button to help users navigate back to the top of the page.\n  * Social media: A social media website may have a scroll to top button to help users navigate back to the top of the page.\n  * Webinars: A webinar may have a scroll to top button to help users navigate back to the top of the page.\n\nUnderstanding the code:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ isVisible: false }\": This is the data that will be used to store the visibility of the button.\n  * x-init=\"window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { isVisible = window.scrollY > 100; })\": This is the event listener that will be added to the window object.\n  * class=\"fixed bottom-6 right-6 z-50\": This is the class that will be added to the button.\n  * x-show=\"isVisible\": This is the condition that will be checked when the button is shown.\n  * x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\": This is the enter transition that will be applied when the button is shown.\n  * x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform translate-y-2\": This is the enter start transition that will be applied when the button is shown.\n  * x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform translate-y-0\": This is the enter end transition that will be applied when the button is shown.\n  * x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\": This is the leave transition that will be applied when the button is hidden.\n  * x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform translate-y-0\": This is the leave start transition that will be applied when the button is hidden.\n  * x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform translate-y-2\": This is the leave end transition that will be applied when the button is hidden.\n  * <button: This is the button element.\n  * title=\"Scroll to top\": This is the title attribute that will be added to the button. For accessibility purposes, it is recommended to use a descriptive title that accurately describes the button\u2019s purpose.\n  * aria-label=\"Scroll to top\": This is the aria-label attribute that will be added to the button. For accessibility purposes, it is recommended to use a descriptive aria-label that accurately describes the button\u2019s purpose.\n  * @click=\"window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })\": This is the event listener that will be added to the button.\n\nClasses are removed for brevity and clarity within the code, but I\u2019ll keep\nthose classes relveant to the tutorial.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ isVisible: false }\" x-init=\"window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { isVisible = window.scrollY > 100; })\" class=\"fixed bottom-6 right-6 z-50\" x-show=\"isVisible\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform translate-y-2\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform translate-y-0\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform translate-y-0\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform translate-y-2\"> <button title=\"Scroll to top\" aria-label=\"Scroll to top\" @click=\"window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })\" > scroll to top </button> </div>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a simple scroll to top button that can be used for any type of\ncontent, such as blogs, e-commerce, landing pages, social media, or webinars.\nThe code is easy to understand and the structure is clear. The use of Tailwind\nCSS and Alpine.js makes it easy to style the button and add interactivity.\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial and have a great day!\n\n## Reviews and opinions\n\nSee them all\n\n  * \"I bought a beautiful theme from Lexington a couple weeks ago.
