Its poor reputation is often\nassociated with WordPress, which is considered one of the worst software of\nthe 21st century.\n\nBesides WordPress, let's quickly explore PHP and why it might be a good choice\nfor web development in 2024.\n\n### Performance\n\nPHP is becoming faster over time, particularly with the latest versions, php\n8.1 and above, which is quite fast. Although it may be slower than programming\nlanguages like Go or Java in some cases, it is comparable to, if not faster\nthan, Python or Node.js in terms of speed.\n\n### Development Speed\n\nEven if you're not familiar with PHP, it's quite similar to Python, with only\na few minor differences. This similarity helps speed up development. From\nperforming simple CRUD operations to handling files, webhooks and websockets,\neverything can be done with minimal code. This is because there are libraries\navailable for almost any task you might need to accomplish, eliminating the\nneed to write extensive code yourself.\n\n### Deployment\n\nOne of the key advantages of PHP is its ease of deployment, even at scale.\nWith a simple PHP server and nginx, you can be up and running in just a few\nhours.\n\nScalability\n\nWhat about scalability? Of course load balancing your application it is\nnecessary with any programming languages especially if you get millions of\nrequests daily, but even if you don't if you correctly implement caching on\nyour endpoints you will not have any problem at all.\n\n### Clean Code and Readability\n\nPHP can be messy when it comes to writing clean code. However, using\nframeworks like Laravel, which provide a boilerplate, solves that problem.\nEven in large APIs with over 200,000 lines of code (excluding the\nautogenerated files), the code can remain very readable if you keep it simple.\n\nThe only programming language I would consider better for writing clean code\nis Python.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it's advisable to construct your primary monolith API using\nPHP/Laravel due to its robust framework capabilities that simplify the\nmanagement of large codebases. For specialized needs, particularly those\ninvolving artificial intelligence or other CPU-intensive operations, consider\nemploying other programming languages that are optimized for such tasks.\n\nThis strategic division allows you to leverage the strengths of each language\nand technology, ensuring efficiency and maintainability across your projects.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you found this article helpful.
