Called Spy\nPet, the service\u2019s creator says it scrapes more than ten thousand Discord\nservers, and besides selling access to anyone with cryptocurrency, is also\noffering the data for training AI models or to assist law enforcement\nagencies, according to its website.\n\nThe news is not only a brazen abuse of Discord\u2019s platform, but also highlights\nthat Discord messages may be more susceptible to monitoring than ordinary\nusers assume. Typically, a Discord user\u2019s activity is spread across disparate\nservers, with no one entity, except Discord itself, able to see what messages\nsomeone has sent across the platform more broadly. With Spy Pet, third-parties\nincluding stalkers or potentially police can look up specific users and see\nwhat messages they\u2019ve posted on various servers at once.\n\n\u201cHave you ever wondered where your friend hangs out on Discord? Tired of basic\nsearch tools like Discord.id? Look no further!\u201d Spy Pet\u2019s website reads. It\nclaims to be tracking more than 14,000 servers, 600 million users, and\nincludes a database of more than 3 billion messages.\n\n## This post is for paid members only\n\nBecome a paid member for unlimited ad-free access to articles, bonus podcast\ncontent, and more.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Sign up for free access to this post\n\nFree members get access to posts like this one along with an email round-up of\nour week's stories.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAlready have an account?
