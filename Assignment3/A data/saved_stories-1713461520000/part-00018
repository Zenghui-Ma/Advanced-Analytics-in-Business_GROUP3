It allows you to deploy your applications on your own\nserver. JustDeploy handles server connection, Docker installation, and secure\ncertificate generation, making the deployment process seamless and efficient.\nJustDeploy read your app source (.env, Dockfile, docker-compose) and allow you\nto deploy it.\n\nJustDeploy is that it doesn't install anything on your server other than your\napplication. This makes it an ideal choice for small servers with limited\nresources or development environments\n\n## Features\n\n  * Connects to your server\n  * Installs Docker\n  * Deploys your application from Dockerfile\n  * Create tls certificates with let's encrypt\n  * Create git hooks to deploy on every commit\n  * Deploy and connect database from docker-compose\n\n## Screen\n\n## Install\n\n    \n    \n    curl -fsSL https://justdeploy.app/install | bash\n\n## Usage\n\nTo create a new deployment you must run the justdeploy command at the bottom\nof your project where your dockerfile is.\n\n    \n    \n    justdeploy\n\nJustDeploy will create a ./justdeploy folder at the root of your project to be\nable to store the deployment information and the certificates that certify to\ncommunicate with the docker engine.\n\nFor now JustDeploy only support debian base VMs.\n\nAfter running justdeploy, follow the prompts to connect to your server and\ndeploy your application.\n\nit should open your browser on this page.\n\nIn this step you can connect you server and when you click on the button\nJustDeploy install and setup everything he needs.\n\nIn this 2nd step you can configure your application with name and enable tls\nif you want.\n\nYou can see all the process on this video.\n\n### Add Database\n\nWhen you have deploy your app you can create and connect a database services\nfrom preconfigured services or your local docker-compose settings.\n\nOn the Deploy page click on on the databases services tab and create one from\nthe modal.\n\nFeel free to add more preconfigured services with services.json by create a\npull request.\n\nfile is here\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n  * openssl\n  * ssh\n\nBefore deploying your application using JustDeploy, it is required that a\ndomain name is associated with your server. This is a necessary step to\ngenerate the certificate, even if you disable\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome.
