Because we don\u2019t like others manipulating our\nbeliefs. But our fear of being misled by false news pales by comparison to our\nfear of suffering total \u201cmind-control\u201d, such as depicted in the films\nManchurian Candidate or Ghost in the Shell. And the part of our minds we most\nfear losing control of is: our deep values.\n\nAfter all, damage to our memories, abilities, beliefs, or heuristic priorities\nmight be repaired via further experience and thought. But if our deep values\nchange, we won\u2019t want to change them back. This is why mind designers have\nlong presumed that artificial minds would fight hard to prevent \u201cvalue drift\u201d,\nand lock down their deep values. After all, within standard decision theory,\nagents only update their beliefs based on new information, never their\npreferences.\n\nA reluctance to change our deep values fits with our reluctance to change key\npractices and institutions. For example, the US won\u2019t consider changing from\nEnglish to metric units, from presidential to parliamentary democracy, or stop\ndaylight savings time, even though these changes seem clearly better to most\nanalysts.\n\nHowever, while as communities we are reluctant to change key institutions, and\nas individuals we are wary of letting other individuals change our values, as\ncommunities we perhaps surprisingly do not at all lock down our deep values.\nWe instead freely, even with abandon, copy behaviors, beliefs, and values of\nall sorts from our prestigious associates. This allows cultural evolution, The\nSecret of Our Success relative to other animals.\n\nFor example, in my life I have seen a big increase in expected parental\nattention to kids, a switch from cornerstone to capstone marriage norms,\nlengthening of expected career preparation durations, great declines in\nreligion, patriotism and militarism, far more acceptance of homo- and trans-\nsexuality, far stronger norms against sexist or racist language, and a merging\nof national cultures into a global culture, especially among elites.\n\nThese changes are quite shocking if you think about them. A system we rely on\nfar more than our systems of units, voting, or times is changing very fast,\nand no one seems to be in charge, either of picking these changes ahead of\ntime, or of evaluating them after the fact. In my essay Beware Cultural Drift\nI consider some stories trying to frame these as something better than\nmaladaptive culture drift, but was not persuaded. The space of possible\ncultures should mostly be harsh and dysfunctional, where we started was\nfunctional due to strong selection centuries ago, yet our cultures really are\nwandering fast off into that vast space without a plan, map, or light.\n\nSuch changes are even more shocking to those of us old enough to remember when\nour culture told us to have different values than it tells us now. Neither set\nof values came with detailed justifications, and the arguments we are given\nnow for recent value changes are ones we were aware of long ago, and rejected\nthen. So do we just pretend to go along while secretly keeping our old values,\nabandon both the old and new values, or give the new values the benefit of the\ndoubt, and assume our elites had good reasons for them, even if we can\u2019t see\nthem?\n\nThis difficult situation seems a deep challenge to standard decision theory,\nin which one never changes values, only beliefs. If one accepts this standard\nframework, as I do, and also that one is in fact choosing if to accept one\u2019s\nculture\u2019s new values, then one must find a way to see these as \u201cvalues\u201d as\nactually subgoals that we change as a way to preserve our deeper constant\nvalues. But then what could be these deeper values?\n\nOne option is: we each just want to be respected by associates, and are\nwilling to adopt any behaviors or priorities that achieve this end. So we do\nwhatever is respected by others, which is whatever is promoted by the folks\nthey consider prestigious. Now this can\u2019t be a guide to collective action, but\nit does seem a guide to individual action. Though I suspect few are willing to\nsimply embrace this stance.\n\nA big complication is that people often choose to switch cultures, after which\nthey adopt the behaviors and priorities promoted by the prestigious of that\nnew culture. So it seems that we see appropriate behaviors and priorities as\ndepending in which culture you are in, and we seem to respect the prestigious\nof other cultures, not just our own. Does this mean we really share a single\nglobal culture, with a shared concept of who is how prestigious?\n\nI don\u2019t know, and will stop here, content to have just raised some issues\nhere.\n\n### Subscribe to Overcoming Bias\n\nBy Robin Hanson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThis is a blog on why we believe and do what we do, why we pretend otherwise,\nhow we might do better, and what our descendants might do, if they don't all\ndie.\n\n42 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n42\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Old Folks See Culture Change\n\nwww.overcomingbias.com\n\n13\n\nShare\n\n13 Comments\n\nPeter GerdesPeter\u2019s SubstackApr 16\u00b7edited Apr 16I don't think it actually\npresents a challenge to standard deciscion theory -- only the assumption that\nwhat we call our values and beliefs actually correspond to the decision theory\nconcepts.I mean you could model us as actually having values that highly prize\nsignalling we aren't weird or divergent from our community. And looking at\npeople's willingness to bet on their supposed beliefs in high stakes\nsituations suggests that in some sense we don't really believe them.Though, we\nshould keep in mind (especially in AI discussions as people often make this\nerror) that beliefs/values aren't real things out there in the world and are\ninstead just hueristic idealizations used to predict behavior within a certain\nrange of cases.I mean, this can trivially be seen to be true with extreme\ntorture where people can be made to say things even knowing that long term it\nwill result in worse pain just to make the immediate pain stop. Or in the fact\nthat what people profess to believe in religious contexts about life after\ndeath doesn't actually impact behavior in the way one might assume.Ultimately,\nif you cut open a person or computer you don't find beliefs or values just\nalgorithms for behavior. It's just that within certain parameters we can use\nthese theoretical ascriptions to make predictions about that behavior.Expand\nfull commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nLeo AbstractApr 16Been loving these explorations, really thought provoking. My\nsupposition is that we evolved without respect to explicit values or beliefs,\nin an environment in which the feedback loops for cultural change were fairly\nswift and the rate of drift fairly slow. We shouldn't expect ourselves to be\nable to deal with this well. Hopefully the cautionary tales that accompany the\nphysical ruins of our civilization will at least be entertaining and well\nwritten.
