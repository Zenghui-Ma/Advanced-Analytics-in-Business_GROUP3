Live on YouTube, he tracked price trends from a social\nmedia account on X. The account, under the name \"Jumbot,\" displays the logo of\na famous supermarket chain and presents itself as a \"robot\" that tracks the\nprices of basic necessities on the Jumbo supermarket website to report\nchanges.\n\nThe tweets show a drop in prices in the first week of April. A result that the\nfar-right president, who believes that the severe austerity policies\nimplemented since he came to power will \"put an end to inflation\" in a country\nwhere it has become chronic, is thrilled to share with his audience.\n\nThe issue arose when Jumbot \u2013 which turned out to be a fake account \u2013 denied\nthe information. \"This account is a social experiment. (...) No robot has ever\nfollowed Jumbo's prices. But it served a purpose. To expose the need for some\nto show results that reality denies,\" explained a message published a few\nhours later. Indeed, food prices have risen by almost 50% since the start of\nthe year, according to the National Institute of Statistics.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Argentina's Milei takes aim at the 'traitors' who\nscuppered his mega-bill\n\n## 'Systematic half-truths'\n\n\"There is a very worrying aspect to the government's and the president's\ncommunication, that of spreading systematic half-truths \u2013 with a certain\ndegree of plausibility \u2013 that persist and are interpreted by the receiver\naccording to his or her sensitivity,\" analyzed Rolando Muzzin, political\ncommunication consultant and researcher at the Tres de Febrero University in\nCaseros.\n\nDespite falling into the trap of \"Jumbogate\" (named after the supermarket\nchain in question), political communication analysts agree on one point: the\ngovernment's communication is professional and effective. \"It's very clever\nand highlights the inability of its political opponents to counter it. It is\ncharacterized by its provocative tone and manages to impose itself at the\nheart of debates, capturing the attention of the public and the media,\"\nexplained Muzzin.\n\nDeveloped mainly through personal accounts, the digital dimension is a\nfundamental pillar of government communication. \"Javier Milei is a media-born\nfigure, from television as a polemicist, but especially from social media,\nwhich are his natural environment,\" explained Lucia Vincent, a political\nscientist at the University of San Martin, specializing in political\ncommunication. The success of the presidential campaign of Milei, whose\npersonality shows \"relational difficulties,\" according to Vincent, is largely\ndue to his strategy on social media and the fervent activity of his followers.\n\"His contact with reality is X,\" she added.\n\nYou have 51.99% of this article left to read.
