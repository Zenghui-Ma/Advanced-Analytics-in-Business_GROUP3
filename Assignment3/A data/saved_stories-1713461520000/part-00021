I guess I am not alone. Literally everyone I know\nhas too much stuff.\n\nAccumulating stuff is easy:\n\nWhenever I \"need\" something I go to Amazon, order it, and on the next day or\nso someone brings new stuff to me.\n\nGetting rid of stuff is hard:\n\nWhenever I want to get rid of something, I take some nice pictures of the\nthing, do some online research on a fair price for the used thing, write a\nnice description, and put everything on eBay (or Craigslist, or Willhaben here\nin Austria). After that, I need to communicate with some possible buyers, re-\nnegotiate the price, and make an appointment when the buyer can come to pick\nup the thing. (Or I need to package the thing and bring it to a post office to\nsend it to the buyer.)\n\nI could also throw the thing into the trash, but most of the stuff I want to\nget rid of is still perfectly fine. It would just be such a waste to throw it\naway, I do not have the heart to do something like this.\n\nThe solution: Reverse Amazon\n\nImagine this: I want to get rid of some stuff. I take one picture of the thing\nwith an app. On the same day, someone comes to my place and picks the thing\nup. When the thing is sold I get the money wired to my bank account.\n\nThis would be so convenient!\n\nYou would probably need some warehouse of sorts where you bring the stuff to\ntake pictures and sell online. You also can have a network of buyers who are\nconstantly looking for a certain category of items. You also could have a \"if\nnot sold in 2 weeks, please donate to people in need\" feature. You could also\nhave a physical store for the stuff. The people picking up the stuff could be\ngig workers like the food delivery persons. You probably have to think about\nsome fraud detection. If my stuff can not be sold or donated, I will not get\nmoney but will have to pay for its disposal.\n\nCould someone please build this? I can be a beta tester, early adopter, and\nevangelist!\n\n## Recent Posts\n\nSee All\n\nThat Day, I Deleted Our Production Database.\n\nOnce upon a time, I was hired as the second engineer in a startup.
