There are standardised guidelines,\nthe Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR), for CT scan in mTBI that rule out patients\non either anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapy. All patients with these\ntherapies undergo a CT scan irrespectively of other consideration.\n\nObjective: To determine whether standard guidelines could be applied to\npatients on anticoagulants or anti-platelet drugs.\n\nDesign, settings, and participants: 1,015 patients with mTBI and Glasgow Coma\nScore (GCS) of 15 were prospectively recruited, 509 either on anticoagulant or\nanti-platelet therapy and 506 on neither. All patients on neither therapy\nunderwent CT scan following guidelines. All patients with mTBI on either\ntherapy underwent CT scan irrespective of the guidelines.\n\nOutcome measure and analysis: Primary endpoint was the incidence of post-\ntraumatic intracranial bleeding in patients either on anticoagulants or anti-\nplatelet drugs and in patients who were not on these therapies. Bayesian\nstatistical analysis with calculation of Confidence Intervals (CI) was then\nperformed.\n\nMain results: Sixty scans were positive for bleeding: 59 patients fulfilled\nthe criteria and 1 did not. Amongst patients with haemorrhage, 24 were on\neither therapy and only one did not meet the guidelines but in this patient\nthe CT scan was performed before 2 h from the mTBI. Patients on either therapy\ndid not have higher bleeding rates than patients on neither. There were higher\nbleeding rates in patients on anti-platelet therapy who met the guidelines vs.\npatients who did not. These rates overlapped with patients on neither therapy,\nmeeting CCHR.\n\nConclusion: The CCHR might be used for mTBI patients on either therapy.\nAnticoagulants and anti-platelet drugs should not be considered a risk factor\nfor patients with mTBI and a GCS of 15. Multicentric studies are needed to\nconfirm this result.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI), defined as brain function impairment due to\nexternal forces (1, 2) resulting in loss of consciousness, amnesia or\ndisorientation (3) is one of the commonest occurrences at the Emergency\nDepartment (ED) worldwide (4).\n\nTBI is classified in severe (GCS \u2264 8), moderate (GCS from 9 to 13) and mild\n(GCS \u2265 14) (5).\n\nWhilst there is evidence about the need of a head CT scan for patients with a\nmoderate or severe TBI, there is still discussion on when a patient with mild\ntraumatic brain injury (mTBI) should undergo CT. Several guidelines exist, the\nmost important of which is the Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) (6, 7), to assist\nin deciding when further diagnostic investigation is required for mTBI (1).\nThe CCHR for patients with mTBI is 99%\u2013100% sensitive in detecting patients\nneeding a neurosurgical intervention, but is lacking in specificity (39%\u201351%)\n(8). The incidence of intracranial bleeding in patients with GCS 15 who meet\nthe criteria for the rule is about 5%\u20138% (9). The CCHR was derived excluding\npeople on anticoagulant or anti-platelet medication assuming all those with\nany TBI symptoms (loss of consciousness, amnesia, etc.) would require CT\nimaging. There was no explicit comment on the need for CT imaging in the\ncontext of head injury without clear evidence of TBI in people with\nanticoagulant and anti-platelet medication. A recent systematic review could\nnot identify robust empirical data to inform recommendations in this\npopulation (10, 11).\n\nHistorically anticoagulant and anti-platelet drugs have been considered a risk\nfactor in traumatic brain injury. The American College of Emergency Physicians\n(2008) states that the management of patients on anticoagulants is unclear and\ngives no specific recommendations (8). The latest update of the NICE Head\nInjury Guidelines (11) recommend a head CT for any medium risk patient (GCS 15\nwithin 2 h of injury with history of loss of consciousness or amnesia) taking\nany anticoagulant or anti-platelet regime \u2013 excluding aspirin monotherapy.\nWhere no loss of consciousness or amnesia has occurred shared decision making\nrather than a mandatory CT brain scan is recommended. The consequence is that\nevery patient on either anticoagulants or anti-platelet drugs with a mTBI\nundergoes a CT scan.\n\nThe number of patients on anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapy is\nincreasing. This is mainly due to the increase in the ageing population. The\nincidence of hospital presentation for mild TBI will also be a significant\nissue in an ageing population.\n\nThe total anticoagulant prescription nearly doubled from 2014 to 2019 in the\nUK (15.0 million doses vs. 33.0 million doses) (8). Around 43 million adults\nin the US (19.0%) took aspirin at least three times per week for more than 3\nmonths in 2010. This was an increase of 57% in aspirin use compared with 2005\n(12).\n\nThe resulting increasing number of patients on these therapies presenting with\nmTBI makes it necessary for the clinician to weigh the risk of haemorrhage and\nthe risk of irradiating the brain which can lead to radiation-related damage,\nas well as the costs of performing unnecessary examinations (13\u201315).\n\nIntracranial bleeding represents the most feared complication in patients\nunder antithrombotic agents, since it is associated with high morbidity and\nmortality. There is, however, limited evidence of the role of these drugs on\nmortality after mTBI (4, 16, 17). Literature suggests that anti-platelet and\nanticoagulant therapy increase the risk for intracranial haematoma and its\nprogression after mTBI (16, 17), but these evidence is based on patients using\nvitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or anti-platelet drugs. In the last few years,\ndirect oral anticoagulants (DOACs) diffusion has led to the knowledge that\nthese drugs could be safer than VKAs also in the setting of mTBI (18).\n\nThe present study aims at determining whether there is a difference in\nintracerebral haemorrhage rates in patients with GCS 15 taking either\nantithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy in the mild TBI patients vs. those not\non either therapy as an independent risk factor. If this is the case, CCHR\ncould be applied to these patients, reducing the exposure to unneeded\nradiation. This will help define the management of mTBI in patients under\nanticoagulant or anti-platelet treatments.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study design and study period\n\nThis is a mono-centre prospective cohort observational study, involving\npatients\u2019 charts data collection from adults presenting with mTBI (that is\nhead trauma resulting in loss of consciousness, amnesia or disorientation) to\nthe Emergency Department from the 29th April 2021 to the 31st June 2022.\n\nThe study received the approval of the local Ethics Committee and the\nparticipants signed an informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance\nwith the declaration of Helsinki.\n\n### Sample size calculation\n\nA sample size calculation was undertaken. Null hypothesis was that there are\nno differences in bleeding between patients with mild brain injury and GCS 15\non anticoagulant/anti-platelet therapy vs. patients with mild brain injury and\nGCS 15 not on anticoagulant/anti-platelet therapy. To test this null\nhypothesis, we had to assume a difference between patients who were and were\nnot on either therapy. We assumed 5%, as this is the incidence of intracranial\nbleeding in patients neither on anticoagulants nor on anti-platelet drugs\nmeeting CCHR (5). The sample size was calculated to have 80% power, 95%\nconfidence level and 2% margin of error. This sample size was 457 subjects for\neach group. Therefore, we planned to recruit at least 914 patients.\n\n### Participants description\n\nWe included all the adult patients presenting during the study period with\nmTBI and GCS 15, both on anticoagulants or anti-platelet drugs and neither\nmeeting criteria for mild traumatic brain injury. Exclusion criteria were:\nmedical cause of head trauma (e.g., syncope, epilepsy...), GCS 2 h after\ntrauma of 14 or less, presence of seizures after injury, pregnancy, delayed\npresentation (>24 h), not having taken regular anti-platelet or anticoagulant\ntherapy, absence of written consent.\n\nThe regularity of taking anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapy was\nascertained by interviewing patients, family members and family physicians.\n\nPatients not on therapy were included in the study only when meeting CCHR\ncriteria for performing a head CT scan.\n\nOne month after the access to ED, enrolled patients received a follow-up phone\ncall to find out their condition.\n\n### Outcome measures\n\nPrimary endpoint was the incidence of intracranial bleeding in patients either\non anticoagulants or anti-platelet drugs and in patients who were not on these\ntherapies.\n\nSecondary endpoints were:\n\n\u2022 the need for intervention after post traumatic head bleeding in the two\ngroups;\n\n\u2022 the reliability of CT Head Rule in patients on either anticoagulants or\nanti-platelet drugs;\n\n\u2022 to assess whether anticoagulants and/or anti-platelet drugs are a risk\nfactor for patients presenting with mTBI and GCS of 15; and\n\n\u2022 to compare mortality and morbidity after mTBI in the two groups with a\nfollow-up period of 1 month.\n\n### Data validation\n\nTwo months were selected randomly for data validation. An independent research\ncollaborator was identified to determine the number of patients who should be\nincluded in the study within the data collection period and check if any were\nmissed or added unrightfully. This collaborator was not involved in the\ninitial data collection. No differences were detected.\n\n### Data analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using the open source packages \u201cPandas,\u201d\n\u201cNumPy,\u201d \u201cSciPy,\u201d \u201cSeaborn,\u201d and \u201cPyMC\u201d for Mac Os X versions 1.4.1, 1.21.2,\n1.7.3, 0.11.2, and 3.11.14, respectively. Statistical significance was\nconsidered achieved based on highly credible intervals of parameter estimates\nand p < 0.05. Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated at 95%.\n\nSince we needed to compare proportions of haemorrhages in different sub-\npopulations, we performed both a two-tail t-test computation based on classic\nproportion comparison using Fischer exact test, and a Bayesian estimate of the\nparameter distribution of a Bernoulli stochastic variable to model bleeding\noccurrences using a non-informative uniform prior distribution over the\ninterval 0\u20131. The estimate was obtained by using the Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm in a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model, with a burn-in of 5,000\niterations and runs lasting 40,000 iterations. Traces were inspected to verify\nconvergence diagnostics (Geweke plots and Raftery-Lewis analysis). The\nposterior parameter distribution was then plotted in order to have a graphical\noverview and confidence intervals were estimated. Furthermore, by sampling the\nposterior distributions, we were able to estimate both probability that the\nparameters describing one population would be different from each other as\nwell as the estimate confidence intervals for Relative Risk (19).\n\n## Results\n\nBetween April 2021 and June 2022, 1,015 patients were enrolled, 509 on either\nanticoagulants or anti-platelet drugs and 506 on neither.\n\nPersonal data, causes of injury, met criteria for CCHR, presence or absence of\nhaemorrhage at CT, need for surgical intervention, reason for\nanticoagulant/anti-platelet therapy, are summarised in Tables 1, 2.\n\nINR values of 37 out of 52 patients anticoagulated with VKA were recorded. The\nmean value was 1.78 (range 1.2\u20136.6), 3 patients had a subtherapeutic value\n(\u22641.5), 18 patients a therapeutic value (1.5 < INR < 2.5) and 16 patients an\novertherapeutic value (\u22652.5).\n\nOf the 1,015 CT scans performed 60 resulted positive for haemorrhage (5.9%).\n\nWe considered a CT scan positive when there was any trace of blood, even the\nsmallest (even one single petechia). Of these positive patients, 24 were\npatients on either anticoagulants or anti-platelets and 36 on neither. Amongst\nthe 60 patients who resulted positive for haemorrhage at CT scan, only one\nseemed not to meet the criteria for the CCHR. This was a 74 year old patient\non aspirin (in primary prevention) who accidentally fell from her height and\nhit the back of the head. She arrived at the hospital by ambulance 30 min\nafter the accident and GCS assessment was performed at the arrival (GCS 15).\nCT scan was performed at 50 min from the fall and was positive for subdural\nhaematoma. Thirty minutes after she became confused and did not recognise her\nson (GCS 12 E3 V3 M6). She underwent neurosurgical intervention as a\nconsequence of the positive CT scan for subdural haematoma.\n\nThe remaining 59 positive patients met CCHR (Table 3) criteria for head CT,\nhad minimal bleeding, remained stable at the next CT check-up and did not\nrequire surgery. Anti-platelet and anticoagulant therapy was discontinued\n(with the exception of one patient on warfarin therapy for a mechanical mitral\nvalve, who was anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin and closely\nmonitored, with no progression of minimal subarachnoid haemorrhage detected on\nCT).\n\nTable 3\n\nTable 3. Canadian CT head rule criteria\u2014from the work of Stiell et al. (6).\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Description of sample.\n\nTable 2\n\nTable 2. Description of sample by confounding factors.\n\nNo reversal agents were administered to any patient with a positive scan due\nto the scarcity of bleeding.\n\nThere was no difference in terms of bleeding in the two groups, on\nanticoagulant/anti-platelet therapy and patients on neither. The two CI\ngreatly overlapped.\n\nAt 1 month follow-up we could reach all patients but 20 with a telephone call:\n18 did not answer and for two patients phone number was missing. No patient\nhad died or suffered complications following trauma. One patient on DOACs with\nnegative CT scan had suspended rivaroxaban and suffered from ischemic stroke 3\ndays later. Two patients on neither therapy returned to the ED after 4 and 7\ndays, reporting headache and neck pain. Investigations revealed no\ncomplications and they were discharged home. One last patient on neither drug\nreported paraesthesias in all four limbs after trauma: an MRI of the spine\nruled out major complications.\n\nOf the 509 patients on anticoagulants/anti-platelets, 387 met inclusion\ncriteria for CCHR.\n\nThe comparison of patients undergoing either therapy who did and did not\nfulfil the criteria of the CCHR was statistically significant, as patients who\nfulfilled the criteria had a higher probability of haemorrhage (p = 0.023, CI\n4.0%\u20139.1% for fulfilled and 1.0%\u20134.9% for unfulfilled criteria).\n\nAmongst participants who met CCHR criteria, the comparison between patients\nwho did take anticoagulants or anti-platelet drugs and the patients on neither\nwas not statistically significant. The two groups overlapped.\n\nWhen separating the categories of anti-platelets and anticoagulants, the\ndifference in bleeding rate of those who did and did not meet the criteria for\nthe Rule was statistically significant for anti-platelets (p = 0.013 CI\n4.8\u201313.1% for met criteria and 1.0\u20136.3% for non-meet criteria; Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. Patients on anti-platelets meeting and non-meeting CT Head Rule, CI\nand relative risk. The population of patients on anti-platelet drugs who did\nnot meet the CT Head Rule criteria (yellow) is compared with those who did\n(blue).\n\nThe population that met the CCHR criteria had a significantly higher rate of\nintracranial bleeding and not statistically significant for anticoagulants (CI\n2.2%\u20138.0% for met criteria and 1.1%\u20136.2% for non-met criteria) with a trend\ntowards more bleeding for patients on anticoagulants who met the criteria.\n\nComparing anticoagulated patients who met the Rule with patients on anti-\nplatelets who met the Rule, the difference was not statistically significant,\nwith a tendency towards more haemorrhages in patients on anticoagulant drugs.\n\nThe comparison between patients anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists\n(VKA) and anticoagulated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) was also not\nstatistically significant: the two categories overlapped.\n\n### Data availability\n\nData from this study are available on https://datadryad.org/stash.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study shows that anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapies are not an\nindependent risk factor for brain haemorrhage in GCS 15 patients and that the\nCCHR might be used for patients with mTBI undergoing these treatments.\n\nIn the literature mTBI has so far been discussed under the assumption that all\npatients on anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapy were at high risk, even if\nthey had a GCS of 15 (8, 11, 20). Many retrospective studies evaluated the\nincidence of bleeding in anticoagulated patients, whilst this paper is giving\nan answer in a prospective study (4, 16\u201318).\n\nThe results reported are of high importance and likely to impact clinical\npractice in the ED.\n\nThe question is not about whether anticoagulants and anti-platelets are\nactually a risk factor for haemorrhage in brain injury, even when mild.\nIndeed, it seems quite clear (although the studies are mostly retrospective)\nthat taking these therapies does carry with it a certain increased risk of\ndeveloping intracranial bleeding after trauma (21\u201323).\n\nWith this regard, several authors emphasise that anti-platelets vs.\nanticoagulants, and amongst the latter, VKAs vs. DOACs, are at higher risk (4,\n13, 22, 24\u201326).\n\nThe question is whether patients with GCS of 15 within 2 h after trauma should\nbe considered in the same way as other patients. The present work shows that\nthis might be possible. If 2 h after trauma they have maintained an intact\nneurological state, they should be considered low-risk patients because it is\nunlikely to be severe damage inside the brain (27). In fact, with regard to\npatients on either therapy, in this study the probability of bleeding even\nwhen meeting the criteria remained comparable to that of patients on neither\ntherapy meeting the same criteria. As for patients on anticoagulants, it\nappears that those with GCS 15 do not have a higher bleeding rate even when\nselected using the Rule criteria.\n\nConsidering possible confounding factors (median age, percentage of patients >\n64 years old, percentage of high-energy incidents, amnesia > 30 min,\npercentage of low energy traumas), patients on anticoagulant or anti-platelet\ntherapy appear older.\n\nThe two groups are also comparable in terms of low energy trauma (with a\nslight tendency to higher energy trauma for the anticoagulants/anti-platelet\ngroup) and amnesia.\n\nWe did not proceed with further calculations because, given their older age\nand similar energy of traumas, they are theoretically at an increased risk of\nICH. Since the comparison between anticoagulants/anti-platelets and patients\non neither therapy yielded similar results, this reinforces our findings.\n\nIn the entire study population, one patient needed surgery for evacuation of a\nsubdural haematoma and she was discharged without neurological sequelae,\nresuming her normal activity in 1 month. Retrospective analysis of the\nemergency department management of this patient revealed that head GCS score\nwas registered early. In fact, it had been performed upon the patient\u2019s\narrival in the emergency department. At 2 h after the trauma (the time pointed\nout by CCHR to assess GCS), the patient was no longer GCS 15 and thus\ntheoretically should have been excluded from the study.\n\nWith regard to the other 58 patients whose CT was positive for haemorrhage, CT\ncontrol was stable in all cases. All patients were discharged without\nneurological sequelae and resumed their normal activity.\n\nOur results are giving an answer to the question whether CCHR is reliable also\nfor patients on anticoagulant and anti-platelet treatment.\n\nMore than the immediate symptoms after a mTBI (amnesia, disorientation,\ntransient loss of consciousness), a normal neurological state after 2 h is\nimportant, regardless of the treatment the patient is taking.\n\nIt is possible to speculate, that the vast majority of CTs performed on GCS 15\npatients, even when they meet the Rule\u2019s criteria, are unnecessary, with the\nexception of patients on anti-platelet therapy.\n\n### Limitations\n\nOur study has some limitations:\n\n\u2022 We were not able to measure antiXa activity in the vast majority of patients\non DOACs, so we did not actually know their coagulation status, even though\nthe patients we enrolled were regularly taking their therapy. Similarly, we\ndid not assess the platelet function of patients on anti-platelet therapy.\nAdherence to therapy seemed to us a good surrogate as DOACs level measures are\nnot routinely requested for these therapies. However, this needs further\ninvestigation in the context of traumatic intracranial haemorrhage.\n\n\u2022 This is a single-centre study that needs confirmation on several sites.\n\n\u2022 We were not able to contact 20 patients on follow-up. However, negative\noutcomes in these 20 individuals are really unlikely (control CT in hospital\nwas stable) and could hardly have changed the outcome of the study.\n\n\u2022 This study analysed a group of anticoagulant or anti-platelet medication\nusers combined: bigger studies are needed that analyse anticoagulants alone\nand anti-platelet drugs alone.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe CCHR could possibly be used for mTBI patients on anticoagulant or anti-\nplatelet therapy, although the number of diagnostic tests requested with the\nhelp of this Rule is probably still too high. Multicenter studies are needed\nto reinforce this opinion.\n\nAnticoagulants and anti-platelet drugs should not be considered per se a risk\nfactor for patients with mTBI and a GCS of 15; the need for CT scan should be\nweighed against the guidelines used for patients on neither therapy.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nRaw data from this study is in the supplementary material.\n\n## Ethics statement\n\nThe studies involving humans were approved by Comitato etico del Canton\nTicino.
