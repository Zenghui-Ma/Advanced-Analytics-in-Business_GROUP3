Here we use recent empirical findings from more than\n1,600 regions worldwide over the past 40 years to project sub-national damages\nfrom temperature and precipitation, including daily variability and\nextremes^7,8. Using an empirical approach that provides a robust lower bound\non the persistence of impacts on economic growth, we find that the world\neconomy is committed to an income reduction of 19% within the next 26 years\nindependent of future emission choices (relative to a baseline without climate\nimpacts, likely range of 11\u201329% accounting for physical climate and empirical\nuncertainty). These damages already outweigh the mitigation costs required to\nlimit global warming to 2 \u00b0C by sixfold over this near-term time frame and\nthereafter diverge strongly dependent on emission choices. Committed damages\narise predominantly through changes in average temperature, but accounting for\nfurther climatic components raises estimates by approximately 50% and leads to\nstronger regional heterogeneity. Committed losses are projected for all\nregions except those at very high latitudes, at which reductions in\ntemperature variability bring benefits. The largest losses are committed at\nlower latitudes in regions with lower cumulative historical emissions and\nlower present-day income.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Climate damage projections beyond annual temperature\n\nArticle Open access 17 April 2024\n\nPaul Waidelich, Fulden Batibeniz, ...

Thomas Sterner\n\n## Main\n\nProjections of the macroeconomic damage caused by future climate change are\ncrucial to informing public and policy debates about adaptation, mitigation\nand climate justice. On the one hand, adaptation against climate impacts must\nbe justified and planned on the basis of an understanding of their future\nmagnitude and spatial distribution^9. This is also of importance in the\ncontext of climate justice^10, as well as to key societal actors, including\ngovernments, central banks and private businesses, which increasingly require\nthe inclusion of climate risks in their macroeconomic forecasts to aid\nadaptive decision-making^11,12. On the other hand, climate mitigation policy\nsuch as the Paris Climate Agreement is often evaluated by balancing the costs\nof its implementation against the benefits of avoiding projected physical\ndamages. This evaluation occurs both formally through cost\u2013benefit\nanalyses^1,4,5,6, as well as informally through public perception of\nmitigation and damage costs^13.\n\nProjections of future damages meet challenges when informing these debates, in\nparticular the human biases relating to uncertainty and remoteness that are\nraised by long-term perspectives^14. Here we aim to overcome such challenges\nby assessing the extent of economic damages from climate change to which the\nworld is already committed by historical emissions and socio-economic inertia\n(the range of future emission scenarios that are considered socio-economically\nplausible^15). Such a focus on the near term limits the large uncertainties\nabout diverging future emission trajectories, the resulting long-term climate\nresponse and the validity of applying historically observed climate\u2013economic\nrelations over long timescales during which socio-technical conditions may\nchange considerably. As such, this focus aims to simplify the communication\nand maximize the credibility of projected economic damages from future climate\nchange.\n\nIn projecting the future economic damages from climate change, we make use of\nrecent advances in climate econometrics that provide evidence for impacts on\nsub-national economic growth from numerous components of the distribution of\ndaily temperature and precipitation^3,7,8. Using fixed-effects panel\nregression models to control for potential confounders, these studies exploit\nwithin-region variation in local temperature and precipitation in a panel of\nmore than 1,600 regions worldwide, comprising climate and income data over the\npast 40 years, to identify the plausibly causal effects of changes in several\nclimate variables on economic productivity^16,17. Specifically, macroeconomic\nimpacts have been identified from changing daily temperature variability,\ntotal annual precipitation, the annual number of wet days and extreme daily\nrainfall that occur in addition to those already identified from changing\naverage temperature^2,3,18. Moreover, regional heterogeneity in these effects\nbased on the prevailing local climatic conditions has been found using\ninteractions terms. The selection of these climate variables follows micro-\nlevel evidence for mechanisms related to the impacts of average temperatures\non labour and agricultural productivity^2, of temperature variability on\nagricultural productivity and health^7, as well as of precipitation on\nagricultural productivity, labour outcomes and flood damages^8 (see Extended\nData Table 1 for an overview, including more detailed references). References\n^7,8 contain a more detailed motivation for the use of these particular\nclimate variables and provide extensive empirical tests about the robustness\nand nature of their effects on economic output, which are summarized in\nMethods. By accounting for these extra climatic variables at the sub-national\nlevel, we aim for a more comprehensive description of climate impacts with\ngreater detail across both time and space.\n\n## Constraining the persistence of impacts\n\nA key determinant and source of discrepancy in estimates of the magnitude of\nfuture climate damages is the extent to which the impact of a climate variable\non economic growth rates persists. The two extreme cases in which these\nimpacts persist indefinitely or only instantaneously are commonly referred to\nas growth or level effects^19,20 (see Methods section \u2018Empirical model\nspecification: fixed-effects distributed lag models\u2019 for mathematical\ndefinitions). Recent work shows that future damages from climate change depend\nstrongly on whether growth or level effects are assumed^20. Following refs.\n^2,18, we provide constraints on this persistence by using distributed lag\nmodels to test the significance of delayed effects separately for each climate\nvariable. Notably, and in contrast to refs. ^2,18, we use climate variables in\ntheir first-differenced form following ref. ^3, implying a dependence of the\ngrowth rate on a change in climate variables. This choice means that a\nbaseline specification without any lags constitutes a model prior of purely\nlevel effects, in which a permanent change in the climate has only an\ninstantaneous effect on the growth rate^3,19,21. By including lags, one can\nthen test whether any effects may persist further. This is in contrast to the\nspecification used by refs. ^2,18, in which climate variables are used without\ntaking the first difference, implying a dependence of the growth rate on the\nlevel of climate variables. In this alternative case, the baseline\nspecification without any lags constitutes a model prior of pure growth\neffects, in which a change in climate has an infinitely persistent effect on\nthe growth rate. Consequently, including further lags in this alternative case\ntests whether the initial growth impact is recovered^18,19,21. Both of these\nspecifications suffer from the limiting possibility that, if too few lags are\nincluded, one might falsely accept the model prior. The limitations of\nincluding a very large number of lags, including loss of data and increasing\nstatistical uncertainty with an increasing number of parameters, mean that\nsuch a possibility is likely. By choosing a specification in which the model\nprior is one of level effects, our approach is therefore conservative by\ndesign, avoiding assumptions of infinite persistence of climate impacts on\ngrowth and instead providing a lower bound on this persistence based on what\nis observable empirically (see Methods section \u2018Empirical model specification:\nfixed-effects distributed lag models\u2019 for further exposition of this\nframework). The conservative nature of such a choice is probably the reason\nthat ref. ^19 finds much greater consistency between the impacts projected by\nmodels that use the first difference of climate variables, as opposed to their\nlevels.\n\nWe begin our empirical analysis of the persistence of climate impacts on\ngrowth using ten lags of the first-differenced climate variables in fixed-\neffects distributed lag models. We detect substantial effects on economic\ngrowth at time lags of up to approximately 8\u201310 years for the temperature\nterms and up to approximately 4 years for the precipitation terms (Extended\nData Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 2). Furthermore, evaluation by means of\ninformation criteria indicates that the inclusion of all five climate\nvariables and the use of these numbers of lags provide a preferable trade-off\nbetween best-fitting the data and including further terms that could cause\noverfitting, in comparison with model specifications excluding climate\nvariables or including more or fewer lags (Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary\nMethods Section 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We therefore remove\nstatistically insignificant terms at later lags (Supplementary Figs. 1\u20133 and\nSupplementary Tables 2\u20134). Further tests using Monte Carlo simulations\ndemonstrate that the empirical models are robust to autocorrelation in the\nlagged climate variables (Supplementary Methods Section 2 and Supplementary\nFigs. 4 and 5), that information criteria provide an effective indicator for\nlag selection (Supplementary Methods Section 2 and Supplementary Fig. 6), that\nthe results are robust to concerns of imperfect multicollinearity between\nclimate variables and that including several climate variables is actually\nnecessary to isolate their separate effects (Supplementary Methods Section 3\nand Supplementary Fig. 7). We provide a further robustness check using a\nrestricted distributed lag model to limit oscillations in the lagged parameter\nestimates that may result from autocorrelation, finding that it provides\nsimilar estimates of cumulative marginal effects to the unrestricted model\n(Supplementary Methods Section 4 and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Finally, to\nexplicitly account for any outstanding uncertainty arising from the precise\nchoice of the number of lags, we include empirical models with marginally\ndifferent numbers of lags in the error-sampling procedure of our projection of\nfuture damages. On the basis of the lag-selection procedure (the significance\nof lagged terms in Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 2, as well as\ninformation criteria in Extended Data Fig. 3), we sample from models with\neight to ten lags for temperature and four for precipitation (models shown in\nSupplementary Figs. 1\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 2\u20134). In summary, this\nempirical approach to constrain the persistence of climate impacts on economic\ngrowth rates is conservative by design in avoiding assumptions of infinite\npersistence, but nevertheless provides a lower bound on the extent of impact\npersistence that is robust to the numerous tests outlined above.\n\n## Committed damages until mid-century\n\nWe combine these empirical economic response functions (Supplementary Figs.\n1\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 2\u20134) with an ensemble of 21 climate models (see\nSupplementary Table 5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6\n(CMIP-6)^22 to project the macroeconomic damages from these components of\nphysical climate change (see Methods for further details). Bias-adjusted\nclimate models that provide a highly accurate reproduction of observed\nclimatological patterns with limited uncertainty (Supplementary Table 6) are\nused to avoid introducing biases in the projections. Following a well-\ndeveloped literature^2,3,19, these projections do not aim to provide a\nprediction of future economic growth. Instead, they are a projection of the\nexogenous impact of future climate conditions on the economy relative to the\nbaselines specified by socio-economic projections, based on the plausibly\ncausal relationships inferred by the empirical models and assuming ceteris\nparibus. Other exogenous factors relevant for the prediction of economic\noutput are purposefully assumed constant.\n\nA Monte Carlo procedure that samples from climate model projections, empirical\nmodels with different numbers of lags and model parameter estimates (obtained\nby 1,000 block-bootstrap resamples of each of the regressions in Supplementary\nFigs. 1\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 2\u20134) is used to estimate the combined\nuncertainty from these sources. Given these uncertainty distributions, we find\nthat projected global damages are statistically indistinguishable across the\ntwo most extreme emission scenarios until 2049 (at the 5% significance level;\nFig. 1). As such, the climate damages occurring before this time constitute\nthose to which the world is already committed owing to the combination of past\nemissions and the range of future emission scenarios that are considered\nsocio-economically plausible^15. These committed damages comprise a permanent\nincome reduction of 19% on average globally (population-weighted average) in\ncomparison with a baseline without climate-change impacts (with a likely range\nof 11\u201329%, following the likelihood classification adopted by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); see caption of Fig. 1). Even\nthough levels of income per capita generally still increase relative to those\nof today, this constitutes a permanent income reduction for most regions,\nincluding North America and Europe (each with median income reductions of\napproximately 11%) and with South Asia and Africa being the most strongly\naffected (each with median income reductions of approximately 22%; Fig. 1).\nUnder a middle-of-the road scenario of future income development (SSP2, in\nwhich SSP stands for Shared Socio-economic Pathway), this corresponds to\nglobal annual damages in 2049 of 38 trillion in 2005 international dollars\n(likely range of 19\u201359 trillion 2005 international dollars). Compared with\nempirical specifications that assume pure growth or pure level effects, our\npreferred specification that provides a robust lower bound on the extent of\nclimate impact persistence produces damages between these two extreme\nassumptions (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 1: The commitment and divergence of economic climate damages versus\nmitigation costs.\n\nEstimates of the projected reduction in income per capita from changes in all\nclimate variables based on empirical models of climate impacts on economic\noutput with a robust lower bound on their persistence (Extended Data Fig. 1)\nunder a low-emission scenario compatible with the 2 \u00b0C warming target and a\nhigh-emission scenario (SSP2-RCP2.6 and SSP5-RCP8.5, respectively) are shown\nin purple and orange, respectively. Shading represents the 34% and 10%\nconfidence intervals reflecting the likely and very likely ranges,\nrespectively (following the likelihood classification adopted by the IPCC),\nhaving estimated uncertainty from a Monte Carlo procedure, which samples the\nuncertainty from the choice of physical climate models, empirical models with\ndifferent numbers of lags and bootstrapped estimates of the regression\nparameters shown in Supplementary Figs. 1\u20133. Vertical dashed lines show the\ntime at which the climate damages of the two emission scenarios diverge at the\n5% and 1% significance levels based on the distribution of differences between\nemission scenarios arising from the uncertainty sampling discussed above. Note\nthat uncertainty in the difference of the two scenarios is smaller than the\ncombined uncertainty of the two respective scenarios because samples of the\nuncertainty (climate model and empirical model choice, as well as model\nparameter bootstrap) are consistent across the two emission scenarios, hence\nthe divergence of damages occurs while the uncertainty bounds of the two\nseparate damage scenarios still overlap. Estimates of global mitigation costs\nfrom the three IAMs that provide results for the SSP2 baseline and SSP2-RCP2.6\nscenario are shown in light green in the top panel, with the median of these\nestimates shown in bold.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Damages already outweigh mitigation costs\n\nWe compare the damages to which the world is committed over the next 25 years\nto estimates of the mitigation costs required to achieve the Paris Climate\nAgreement. Taking estimates of mitigation costs from the three integrated\nassessment models (IAMs) in the IPCC AR6 database^23 that provide results\nunder comparable scenarios (SSP2 baseline and SSP2-RCP2.6, in which RCP stands\nfor Representative Concentration Pathway), we find that the median committed\nclimate damages are larger than the median mitigation costs in 2050 (six\ntrillion in 2005 international dollars) by a factor of approximately six (note\nthat estimates of mitigation costs are only provided every 10 years by the\nIAMs and so a comparison in 2049 is not possible). This comparison simply aims\nto compare the magnitude of future damages against mitigation costs, rather\nthan to conduct a formal cost\u2013benefit analysis of transitioning from one\nemission path to another. Formal cost\u2013benefit analyses typically find that the\nnet benefits of mitigation only emerge after 2050 (ref. ^5), which may lead\nsome to conclude that physical damages from climate change are simply not\nlarge enough to outweigh mitigation costs until the second half of the\ncentury. Our simple comparison of their magnitudes makes clear that damages\nare actually already considerably larger than mitigation costs and the delayed\nemergence of net mitigation benefits results primarily from the fact that\ndamages across different emission paths are indistinguishable until mid-\ncentury (Fig. 1).\n\nAlthough these near-term damages constitute those to which the world is\nalready committed, we note that damage estimates diverge strongly across\nemission scenarios after 2049, conveying the clear benefits of mitigation from\na purely economic point of view that have been emphasized in previous\nstudies^4,24. As well as the uncertainties assessed in Fig. 1, these\nconclusions are robust to structural choices, such as the timescale with which\nchanges in the moderating variables of the empirical models are estimated\n(Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11), as well as the order in which one accounts\nfor the intertemporal and international components of currency comparison\n(Supplementary Fig. 12; see Methods for further details).\n\n## Damages from variability and extremes\n\nCommitted damages primarily arise through changes in average temperature (Fig.\n2). This reflects the fact that projected changes in average temperature are\nlarger than those in other climate variables when expressed as a function of\ntheir historical interannual variability (Extended Data Fig. 4). Because the\nhistorical variability is that on which the empirical models are estimated,\nlarger projected changes in comparison with this variability probably lead to\nlarger future impacts in a purely statistical sense. From a mechanistic\nperspective, one may plausibly interpret this result as implying that future\nchanges in average temperature are the most unprecedented from the perspective\nof the historical fluctuations to which the economy is accustomed and\ntherefore will cause the most damage. This insight may prove useful in terms\nof guiding adaptation measures to the sources of greatest damage.\n\nFig. 2: The committed economic damages of climate change by sub-national\nregion and climatic component.\n\nEstimates of the median projected reduction in sub-national income per capita\nacross emission scenarios (SSP2-RCP2.6 and SSP2-RCP8.5) as well as climate\nmodel, empirical model and model parameter uncertainty in the year in which\nclimate damages diverge at the 5% level (2049, as identified in Fig. 1). a,\nImpacts arising from all climate variables. b\u2013f, Impacts arising separately\nfrom changes in annual mean temperature (b), daily temperature variability\n(c), total annual precipitation (d), the annual number of wet days (>1 mm) (e)\nand extreme daily rainfall (f) (see Methods for further definitions). Data on\nnational administrative boundaries are obtained from the GADM database version\n3.6 and are freely available for academic use (https://gadm.org/).\n\nFull size image\n\nNevertheless, future damages based on empirical models that consider changes\nin annual average temperature only and exclude the other climate variables\nconstitute income reductions of only 13% in 2049 (Extended Data Fig. 5a,\nlikely range 5\u201321%). This suggests that accounting for the other components of\nthe distribution of temperature and precipitation raises net damages by nearly\n50%. This increase arises through the further damages that these climatic\ncomponents cause, but also because their inclusion reveals a stronger negative\neconomic response to average temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 5b). The latter\nfinding is consistent with our Monte Carlo simulations, which suggest that the\nmagnitude of the effect of average temperature on economic growth is\nunderestimated unless accounting for the impacts of other correlated climate\nvariables (Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\nIn terms of the relative contributions of the different climatic components to\noverall damages, we find that accounting for daily temperature variability\ncauses the largest increase in overall damages relative to empirical\nframeworks that only consider changes in annual average temperature (4.9\npercentage points, likely range 2.4\u20138.7 percentage points, equivalent to\napproximately 10 trillion international dollars). Accounting for precipitation\ncauses smaller increases in overall damages, which are\u2014nevertheless\u2014equivalent\nto approximately 1.2 trillion international dollars: 0.01 percentage points\n(\u22120.37\u20130.33 percentage points), 0.34 percentage points (0.07\u20130.90 percentage\npoints) and 0.36 percentage points (0.13\u20130.65 percentage points) from total\nannual precipitation, the number of wet days and extreme daily precipitation,\nrespectively. Moreover, climate models seem to underestimate future changes in\ntemperature variability^25 and extreme precipitation^26,27 in response to\nanthropogenic forcing as compared with that observed historically, suggesting\nthat the true impacts from these variables may be larger.\n\n## The distribution of committed damages\n\nThe spatial distribution of committed damages (Fig. 2a) reflects a complex\ninterplay between the patterns of future change in several climatic components\nand those of historical economic vulnerability to changes in those variables.\nDamages resulting from increasing annual mean temperature (Fig. 2b) are\nnegative almost everywhere globally, and larger at lower latitudes in regions\nin which temperatures are already higher and economic vulnerability to\ntemperature increases is greatest (see the response heterogeneity to mean\ntemperature embodied in Extended Data Fig. 1a). This occurs despite the\namplified warming projected at higher latitudes^28, suggesting that regional\nheterogeneity in economic vulnerability to temperature changes outweighs\nheterogeneity in the magnitude of future warming (Supplementary Fig. 13a).\nEconomic damages owing to daily temperature variability (Fig. 2c) exhibit a\nstrong latitudinal polarisation, primarily reflecting the physical response of\ndaily variability to greenhouse forcing in which increases in variability\nacross lower latitudes (and Europe) contrast decreases at high latitudes^25\n(Supplementary Fig. 13b). These two temperature terms are the dominant\ndeterminants of the pattern of overall damages (Fig. 2a), which exhibits a\nstrong polarity with damages across most of the globe except at the highest\nnorthern latitudes. Future changes in total annual precipitation mainly bring\neconomic benefits except in regions of drying, such as the Mediterranean and\ncentral South America (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 13c), but these benefits\nare opposed by changes in the number of wet days, which produce damages with a\nsimilar pattern of opposite sign (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 13d). By\ncontrast, changes in extreme daily rainfall produce damages in all regions,\nreflecting the intensification of daily rainfall extremes over global land\nareas^29,30 (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 13e).\n\nThe spatial distribution of committed damages implies considerable injustice\nalong two dimensions: culpability for the historical emissions that have\ncaused climate change and pre-existing levels of socio-economic welfare.\nSpearman\u2019s rank correlations indicate that committed damages are significantly\nlarger in countries with smaller historical cumulative emissions, as well as\nin regions with lower current income per capita (Fig. 3). This implies that\nthose countries that will suffer the most from the damages already committed\nare those that are least responsible for climate change and which also have\nthe least resources to adapt to it.\n\nFig. 3: The injustice of committed climate damages by cumulative historical\nemissions and income.\n\nEstimates of the median projected change in national income per capita across\nemission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) as well as climate model, empirical\nmodel and model parameter uncertainty in the year in which climate damages\ndiverge at the 5% level (2049, as identified in Fig. 1) are plotted against\ncumulative national emissions per capita in 2020 (from the Global Carbon\nProject) and coloured by national income per capita in 2020 (from the World\nBank) in a and vice versa in b. In each panel, the size of each scatter point\nis weighted by the national population in 2020 (from the World Bank). Inset\nnumbers indicate the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation \u03c1 and P-values for a\nhypothesis test whose null hypothesis is of no correlation, as well as the\nSpearman\u2019s rank correlation weighted by national population.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo further quantify this heterogeneity, we assess the difference in committed\ndamages between the upper and lower quartiles of regions when ranked by\npresent income levels and historical cumulative emissions (using a population\nweighting to both define the quartiles and estimate the group averages). On\naverage, the quartile of countries with lower income are committed to an\nincome loss that is 8.9 percentage points (or 61%) greater than the upper\nquartile (Extended Data Fig. 6), with a likely range of 3.8\u201314.7 percentage\npoints across the uncertainty sampling of our damage projections (following\nthe likelihood classification adopted by the IPCC). Similarly, the quartile of\ncountries with lower historical cumulative emissions are committed to an\nincome loss that is 6.9 percentage points (or 40%) greater than the upper\nquartile, with a likely range of 0.27\u201312 percentage points. These patterns\nreemphasize the prevalence of injustice in climate impacts^31,32,33 in the\ncontext of the damages to which the world is already committed by historical\nemissions and socio-economic inertia.\n\n## Contextualizing the magnitude of damages\n\nThe magnitude of projected economic damages exceeds previous literature\nestimates^2,3, arising from several developments made on previous approaches.\nOur estimates are larger than those of ref. ^2 (see first row of Extended Data\nTable 3), primarily because of the facts that sub-national estimates typically\nshow a steeper temperature response (see also refs. ^3,34) and that accounting\nfor other climatic components raises damage estimates (Extended Data Fig. 5).\nHowever, we note that our empirical approach using first-differenced climate\nvariables is conservative compared with that of ref. ^2 in regard to the\npersistence of climate impacts on growth (see introduction and Methods section\n\u2018Empirical model specification: fixed-effects distributed lag models\u2019), an\nimportant determinant of the magnitude of long-term damages^19,21. Using a\nsimilar empirical specification to ref. ^2, which assumes infinite persistence\nwhile maintaining the rest of our approach (sub-national data and further\nclimate variables), produces considerably larger damages (purple curve of\nExtended Data Fig. 3). Compared with studies that do take the first difference\nof climate variables^3,35, our estimates are also larger (see second and third\nrows of Extended Data Table 3). The inclusion of further climate variables\n(Extended Data Fig. 5) and a sufficient number of lags to more adequately\ncapture the extent of impact persistence (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2) are the\nmain sources of this difference, as is the use of specifications that capture\nnonlinearities in the temperature response when compared with ref. ^35. In\nsummary, our estimates develop on previous studies by incorporating the latest\ndata and empirical insights^7,8, as well as in providing a robust empirical\nlower bound on the persistence of impacts on economic growth, which\nconstitutes a middle ground between the extremes of the growth-versus-levels\ndebate^19,21 (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nCompared with the fraction of variance explained by the empirical models\nhistorically (<5%), the projection of reductions in income of 19% may seem\nlarge. This arises owing to the fact that projected changes in climatic\nconditions are much larger than those that were experienced historically,\nparticularly for changes in average temperature (Extended Data Fig. 4). As\nsuch, any assessment of future climate-change impacts necessarily requires an\nextrapolation outside the range of the historical data on which the empirical\nimpact models were evaluated. Nevertheless, these models constitute the most\nstate-of-the-art methods for inference of plausibly causal climate impacts\nbased on observed data. Moreover, we take explicit steps to limit out-of-\nsample extrapolation by capping the moderating variables of the interaction\nterms at the 95th percentile of the historical distribution (see Methods).\nThis avoids extrapolating the marginal effects outside what was observed\nhistorically. Given the nonlinear response of economic output to annual mean\ntemperature (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 2), this is a\nconservative choice that limits the magnitude of damages that we project.\nFurthermore, back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the projected\ndamages are consistent with the magnitude and patterns of historical economic\ndevelopment (see Supplementary Discussion Section 5).\n\n## Missing impacts and spatial spillovers\n\nDespite assessing several climatic components from which economic impacts have\nrecently been identified^3,7,8, this assessment of aggregate climate damages\nshould not be considered comprehensive. Important channels such as impacts\nfrom heatwaves^31, sea-level rise^36, tropical cyclones^37 and tipping\npoints^38,39, as well as non-market damages such as those to ecosystems^40 and\nhuman health^41, are not considered in these estimates. Sea-level rise is\nunlikely to be feasibly incorporated into empirical assessments such as this\nbecause historical sea-level variability is mostly small. Non-market damages\nare inherently intractable within our estimates of impacts on aggregate\nmonetary output and estimates of these impacts could arguably be considered as\nextra to those identified here. Recent empirical work suggests that accounting\nfor these channels would probably raise estimates of these committed damages,\nwith larger damages continuing to arise in the global\nsouth^31,36,37,38,39,40,41,42.\n\nMoreover, our main empirical analysis does not explicitly evaluate the\npotential for impacts in local regions to produce effects that \u2018spill over\u2019\ninto other regions. Such effects may further mitigate or amplify the impacts\nwe estimate, for example, if companies relocate production from one affected\nregion to another or if impacts propagate along supply chains. The current\nliterature indicates that trade plays a substantial role in propagating\nspillover effects^43,44, making their assessment at the sub-national level\nchallenging without available data on sub-national trade dependencies. Studies\naccounting for only spatially adjacent neighbours indicate that negative\nimpacts in one region induce further negative impacts in neighbouring\nregions^45,46,47,48, suggesting that our projected damages are probably\nconservative by excluding these effects. In Supplementary Fig. 14, we assess\nspillovers from neighbouring regions using a spatial-lag model. For\nsimplicity, this analysis excludes temporal lags, focusing only on\ncontemporaneous effects. The results show that accounting for spatial\nspillovers can amplify the overall magnitude, and also the heterogeneity, of\nimpacts. Consistent with previous literature, this indicates that the overall\nmagnitude (Fig. 1) and heterogeneity (Fig. 3) of damages that we project in\nour main specification may be conservative without explicitly accounting for\nspillovers. We note that further analysis that addresses both spatially and\ntrade-connected spillovers, while also accounting for delayed impacts using\ntemporal lags, would be necessary to adequately address this question fully.\nThese approaches offer fruitful avenues for further research but are beyond\nthe scope of this manuscript, which primarily aims to explore the impacts of\ndifferent climate conditions and their persistence.\n\n## Policy implications\n\nWe find that the economic damages resulting from climate change until 2049 are\nthose to which the world economy is already committed and that these greatly\noutweigh the costs required to mitigate emissions in line with the 2 \u00b0C target\nof the Paris Climate Agreement (Fig. 1). This assessment is complementary to\nformal analyses of the net costs and benefits associated with moving from one\nemission path to another, which typically find that net benefits of mitigation\nonly emerge in the second half of the century^5. Our simple comparison of the\nmagnitude of damages and mitigation costs makes clear that this is primarily\nbecause damages are indistinguishable across emissions scenarios\u2014that is,\ncommitted\u2014until mid-century (Fig. 1) and that they are actually already much\nlarger than mitigation costs. For simplicity, and owing to the availability of\ndata, we compare damages to mitigation costs at the global level. Regional\nestimates of mitigation costs may shed further light on the national\nincentives for mitigation to which our results already hint, of relevance for\ninternational climate policy. Although these damages are committed from a\nmitigation perspective, adaptation may provide an opportunity to reduce them.\nMoreover, the strong divergence of damages after mid-century reemphasizes the\nclear benefits of mitigation from a purely economic perspective, as\nhighlighted in previous studies^1,4,6,24.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Historical climate data\n\nHistorical daily 2-m temperature and precipitation totals (in mm) are obtained\nfor the period 1979\u20132019 from the W5E5 database. The W5E5 dataset comes from\nERA-5, a state-of-the-art reanalysis of historical observations, but has been\nbias-adjusted by applying version 2.0 of the WATCH Forcing Data to ERA-5\nreanalysis data and precipitation data from version 2.3 of the Global\nPrecipitation Climatology Project to better reflect ground-based\nmeasurements^49,50,51. We obtain these data on a 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 grid from the\nInter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) database.\nNotably, these historical data have been used to bias-adjust future climate\nprojections from CMIP-6 (see the following section), ensuring consistency\nbetween the distribution of historical daily weather on which our empirical\nmodels were estimated and the climate projections used to estimate future\ndamages. These data are publicly available from the ISIMIP database. See refs.\n^7,8 for robustness tests of the empirical models to the choice of climate\ndata reanalysis products.\n\n### Future climate data\n\nDaily 2-m temperature and precipitation totals (in mm) are taken from 21\nclimate models participating in CMIP-6 under a high (RCP8.5) and a low\n(RCP2.6) greenhouse gas emission scenario from 2015 to 2100. The data have\nbeen bias-adjusted and statistically downscaled to a common half-degree grid\nto reflect the historical distribution of daily temperature and precipitation\nof the W5E5 dataset using the trend-preserving method developed by the\nISIMIP^50,52. As such, the climate model data reproduce observed\nclimatological patterns exceptionally well (Supplementary Table 5). Gridded\ndata are publicly available from the ISIMIP database.\n\n### Historical economic data\n\nHistorical economic data come from the DOSE database of sub-national economic\noutput^53. We use a recent revision to the DOSE dataset that provides data\nacross 83 countries, 1,660 sub-national regions with varying temporal coverage\nfrom 1960 to 2019. Sub-national units constitute the first administrative\ndivision below national, for example, states for the USA and provinces for\nChina. Data come from measures of gross regional product per capita (GRPpc) or\nincome per capita in local currencies, reflecting the values reported in\nnational statistical agencies, yearbooks and, in some cases, academic\nliterature. We follow previous literature^3,7,8,54 and assess real sub-\nnational output per capita by first converting values from local currencies to\nUS dollars to account for diverging national inflationary tendencies and then\naccount for US inflation using a US deflator. Alternatively, one might first\naccount for national inflation and then convert between currencies.\nSupplementary Fig. 12 demonstrates that our conclusions are consistent when\naccounting for price changes in the reversed order, although the magnitude of\nestimated damages varies. See the documentation of the DOSE dataset for\nfurther discussion of these choices. Conversions between currencies are\nconducted using exchange rates from the FRED database of the Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis^55 and the national deflators from the World Bank^56.\n\n### Future socio-economic data\n\nBaseline gridded gross domestic product (GDP) and population data for the\nperiod 2015\u20132100 are taken from the middle-of-the-road scenario SSP2 (ref.\n^15). Population data have been downscaled to a half-degree grid by the ISIMIP\nfollowing the methodologies of refs. ^57,58, which we then aggregate to the\nsub-national level of our economic data using the spatial aggregation\nprocedure described below. Because current methodologies for downscaling the\nGDP of the SSPs use downscaled population to do so, per-capita estimates of\nGDP with a realistic distribution at the sub-national level are not readily\navailable for the SSPs. We therefore use national-level GDP per capita (GDPpc)\nprojections for all sub-national regions of a given country, assuming\nhomogeneity within countries in terms of baseline GDPpc. Here we use\nprojections that have been updated to account for the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on the trajectory of future income, while remaining consistent with\nthe long-term development of the SSPs^59. The choice of baseline SSP alters\nthe magnitude of projected climate damages in monetary terms, but when\nassessed in terms of percentage change from the baseline, the choice of socio-\neconomic scenario is inconsequential. Gridded SSP population data and\nnational-level GDPpc data are publicly available from the ISIMIP database.\nSub-national estimates as used in this study are available in the code and\ndata replication files.\n\n### Climate variables\n\nFollowing recent literature^3,7,8, we calculate an array of climate variables\nfor which substantial impacts on macroeconomic output have been identified\nempirically, supported by further evidence at the micro level for plausible\nunderlying mechanisms. See refs. ^7,8 for an extensive motivation for the use\nof these particular climate variables and for detailed empirical tests on the\nnature and robustness of their effects on economic output. To summarize, these\nstudies have found evidence for independent impacts on economic growth rates\nfrom annual average temperature, daily temperature variability, total annual\nprecipitation, the annual number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall.\nAssessments of daily temperature variability were motivated by evidence of\nimpacts on agricultural output and human health, as well as macroeconomic\nliterature on the impacts of volatility on growth when manifest in different\ndimensions, such as government spending, exchange rates and even output\nitself^7. Assessments of precipitation impacts were motivated by evidence of\nimpacts on agricultural productivity, metropolitan labour outcomes and\nconflict, as well as damages caused by flash flooding^8. See Extended Data\nTable 1 for detailed references to empirical studies of these physical\nmechanisms. Marked impacts of daily temperature variability, total annual\nprecipitation, the number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall on\nmacroeconomic output were identified robustly across different climate\ndatasets, spatial aggregation schemes, specifications of regional time trends\nand error-clustering approaches. They were also found to be robust to the\nconsideration of temperature extremes^7,8. Furthermore, these climate\nvariables were identified as having independent effects on economic\noutput^7,8, which we further explain here using Monte Carlo simulations to\ndemonstrate the robustness of the results to concerns of imperfect\nmulticollinearity between climate variables (Supplementary Methods Section 2),\nas well as by using information criteria (Supplementary Table 1) to\ndemonstrate that including several lagged climate variables provides a\npreferable trade-off between optimally describing the data and limiting the\npossibility of overfitting.\n\nWe calculate these variables from the distribution of daily, d, temperature,\nT_x,d, and precipitation, P_x,d, at the grid-cell, x, level for both the\nhistorical and future climate data. As well as annual mean temperature,\n\\\\({\\bar{T}}_{x,y}\\\\), and annual total precipitation, P_x,y, we calculate\nannual, y, measures of daily temperature variability,\n\\\\({\\widetilde{T}}_{x,y}\\\\):\n\n$${\\widetilde{T}}_{x,y}=\\frac{1}{12}\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{m=1}^{12}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{{D}_{m}}\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{d=1}^{{D}_{m}}{({T}_{x,d,m,y}-{\\bar{T}}_{x,m})}^{2}},$$\n\n(1)\n\nthe number of wet days, Pwd_x,y:\n\n$${{\\rm{Pwd}}}_{x,y}=\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{d=1}^{{D}_{y}}H\\left({P}_{x,d}-1\\,{\\rm{mm}}\\right)$$\n\n(2)\n\nand extreme daily rainfall:\n\n$${{\\rm{Pext}}}_{x,y}=\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{d=1}^{{D}_{y}}H\\left({P}_{x,d}-{P99.9}_{x}\\right)\\times {P}_{x,d},$$\n\n(3)\n\nin which T_x,d,m,y is the grid-cell-specific daily temperature in month m and\nyear y, \\\\({\\bar{T}}_{x,m,{y}}\\\\) is the year and grid-cell-specific monthly,\nm, mean temperature, D_m and D_y the number of days in a given month m or year\ny, respectively, H the Heaviside step function, 1 mm the threshold used to\ndefine wet days and P99.9_x is the 99.9th percentile of historical (1979\u20132019)\ndaily precipitation at the grid-cell level. Units of the climate measures are\ndegrees Celsius for annual mean temperature and daily temperature variability,\nmillimetres for total annual precipitation and extreme daily precipitation,\nand simply the number of days for the annual number of wet days.\n\nWe also calculated weighted standard deviations of monthly rainfall totals as\nalso used in ref. ^8 but do not include them in our projections as we find\nthat, when accounting for delayed effects, their effect becomes statistically\nindistinct and is better captured by changes in total annual rainfall.\n\n### Spatial aggregation\n\nWe aggregate grid-cell-level historical and future climate measures, as well\nas grid-cell-level future GDPpc and population, to the level of the first\nadministrative unit below national level of the GADM database, using an area-\nweighting algorithm that estimates the portion of each grid cell falling\nwithin an administrative boundary. We use this as our baseline specification\nfollowing previous findings that the effect of area or population weighting at\nthe sub-national level is negligible^7,8.\n\n### Empirical model specification: fixed-effects distributed lag models\n\nFollowing a wide range of climate econometric literature^16,60, we use panel\nregression models with a selection of fixed effects and time trends to isolate\nplausibly exogenous variation with which to maximize confidence in a causal\ninterpretation of the effects of climate on economic growth rates. The use of\nregion fixed effects, \u03bc_r, accounts for unobserved time-invariant differences\nbetween regions, such as prevailing climatic norms and growth rates owing to\nhistorical and geopolitical factors. The use of yearly fixed effects, \u03b7_y,\naccounts for regionally invariant annual shocks to the global climate or\neconomy such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation or global recessions. In our\nbaseline specification, we also include region-specific linear time trends,\nk_ry, to exclude the possibility of spurious correlations resulting from\ncommon slow-moving trends in climate and growth.\n\nThe persistence of climate impacts on economic growth rates is a key\ndeterminant of the long-term magnitude of damages. Methods for inferring the\nextent of persistence in impacts on growth rates have typically used lagged\nclimate variables to evaluate the presence of delayed effects or catch-up\ndynamics^2,18. For example, consider starting from a model in which a climate\ncondition, C_r,y, (for example, annual mean temperature) affects the growth\nrate, \u0394lgrp_r,y (the first difference of the logarithm of gross regional\nproduct) of region r in year y:\n\n$${\\Delta {\\rm{lgrp}}}_{r,y}={\\mu }_{r}+{\\eta }_{y}+{k}_{r}y+\\alpha\n{C}_{r,y}+{\\varepsilon }_{r,y},$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhich we refer to as a \u2018pure growth effects\u2019 model in the main text.\nTypically, further lags are included,\n\n$${\\Delta {\\rm{lgrp}}}_{r,y}={\\mu }_{r}+{\\eta }_{y}+{k}_{r}y+\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{L=0}^{{\\rm{NL}}}{\\alpha }_{L}{C}_{r,y-L}+{\\varepsilon }_{r,y},$$\n\n(5)\n\nand the cumulative effect of all lagged terms is evaluated to assess the\nextent to which climate impacts on growth rates persist. Following ref. ^18,\nin the case that,\n\n$$\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{L=0}^{{\\rm{NL}}}{\\alpha }_{L} <\n0\\,{\\rm{for}}\\,{\\alpha }_{0} < 0\\,{\\rm{or}}\\,\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{L=0}^{{\\rm{NL}}}{\\alpha }_{L} > 0\\,{\\rm{for}}\\,{\\alpha }_{0} > 0,$$\n\n(6)\n\nthe implication is that impacts on the growth rate persist up to NL years\nafter the initial shock (possibly to a weaker or a stronger extent), whereas\nif\n\n$$\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{L=0}^{{\\rm{NL}}}{\\alpha }_{L}=0,$$\n\n(7)\n\nthen the initial impact on the growth rate is recovered after NL years and the\neffect is only one on the level of output. However, we note that such\napproaches are limited by the fact that, when including an insufficient number\nof lags to detect a recovery of the growth rates, one may find equation (6) to\nbe satisfied and incorrectly assume that a change in climatic conditions\naffects the growth rate indefinitely. In practice, given a limited record of\nhistorical data, including too few lags to confidently conclude in an\ninfinitely persistent impact on the growth rate is likely, particularly over\nthe long timescales over which future climate damages are often\nprojected^2,24. To avoid this issue, we instead begin our analysis with a\nmodel for which the level of output, lgrp_r,y, depends on the level of a\nclimate variable, C_r,y:\n\n$${{\\rm{lgrp}}}_{r,y}={\\mu }_{r}+{\\eta }_{y}+{k}_{r}y+\\alpha\n{C}_{r,y}+{\\varepsilon }_{r,y}.$$\n\n(8)\n\nGiven the non-stationarity of the level of output, we follow the literature^19\nand estimate such an equation in first-differenced form as,\n\n$${\\Delta {\\rm{lgrp}}}_{r,y}={\\mu }_{r}+{\\eta }_{y}+{k}_{r}y+\\alpha {\\Delta\nC}_{r,y}+{\\varepsilon }_{r,y},$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhich we refer to as a model of \u2018pure level effects\u2019 in the main text. This\nmodel constitutes a baseline specification in which a permanent change in the\nclimate variable produces an instantaneous impact on the growth rate and a\npermanent effect only on the level of output. By including lagged variables in\nthis specification,\n\n$${\\Delta {\\rm{lgrp}}}_{r,y}={\\mu }_{r}+{\\eta }_{y}+{k}_{r}y+\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{L=0}^{{\\rm{NL}}}{\\alpha }_{L}{\\Delta C}_{r,y-L}+{\\varepsilon\n}_{r,y},$$\n\n(9)\n\nwe are able to test whether the impacts on the growth rate persist any further\nthan instantaneously by evaluating whether \u03b1_L > 0 are statistically\nsignificantly different from zero. Even though this framework is also limited\nby the possibility of including too few lags, the choice of a baseline model\nspecification in which impacts on the growth rate do not persist means that,\nin the case of including too few lags, the framework reverts to the baseline\nspecification of level effects. As such, this framework is conservative with\nrespect to the persistence of impacts and the magnitude of future damages. It\nnaturally avoids assumptions of infinite persistence and we are able to\ninterpret any persistence that we identify with equation (9) as a lower bound\non the extent of climate impact persistence on growth rates. See the main text\nfor further discussion of this specification choice, in particular about its\nconservative nature compared with previous literature estimates, such as refs.\n^2,18.\n\nWe allow the response to climatic changes to vary across regions, using\ninteractions of the climate variables with historical average (1979\u20132019)\nclimatic conditions reflecting heterogenous effects identified in previous\nwork^7,8. Following this previous work, the moderating variables of these\ninteraction terms constitute the historical average of either the variable\nitself or of the seasonal temperature difference, \\\\({\\hat{T}}_{r}\\\\), or\nannual mean temperature, \\\\({\\bar{T}}_{r}\\\\), in the case of daily temperature\nvariability^7 and extreme daily rainfall, respectively^8.\n\nThe resulting regression equation with N and M lagged variables, respectively,\nreads:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\Delta {\\rm{lgrp}}}_{r,y}\\,=\\,{\\mu }_{r}+{\\eta\n}_{y}+{k}_{r}y+\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{L=0}^{N}({{\\alpha }_{1,L}\\Delta\n\\bar{T}}_{r,y-L}+{\\alpha }_{2,L}{\\Delta \\bar{T}}_{r,y-L}\\times\n{\\bar{T}}_{r})\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{L=0}^{N}({{\\alpha\n}_{3,L}\\Delta \\widetilde{T}}_{r,y-L}+{\\alpha }_{4,L}{\\Delta\n\\widetilde{T}}_{r,y-L}\\times {\\widehat{T}}_{r})\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{L=0}^{M}({\\alpha }_{5,L}\\Delta {P}_{r,y-L}+{\\alpha }_{6,L}\\Delta\n{P}_{r,y-L}\\times {P}_{r})\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{L=0}^{M}({\\alpha }_{7,L}\\Delta {{\\rm{Pwd}}}_{r,y-L}+{\\alpha\n}_{8,L}\\Delta {{\\rm{Pwd}}}_{r,y-L}\\times {{\\rm{Pwd}}}_{r})\\\\\\\n\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{L=0}^{M}({\\alpha }_{9,L}\\Delta\n{{\\rm{Pext}}}_{r,y-L}+{\\alpha }_{10,L}\\Delta {{\\rm{Pext}}}_{r,y-L}\\times\n{\\bar{T}}_{r})+{{\\epsilon }}_{r,y}\\end{array}$$\n\n(10)\n\nin which \u0394lgrp_r,y is the annual, regional GRPpc growth rate, measured as the\nfirst difference of the logarithm of real GRPpc, following previous\nwork^2,3,7,8,18,19. Fixed-effects regressions were run using the fixest\npackage in R (ref. ^61).\n\nEstimates of the coefficients of interest \u03b1_i,L are shown in Extended Data\nFig. 1 for N = M = 10 lags and for our preferred choice of the number of lags\nin Supplementary Figs. 1\u20133. In Extended Data Fig. 1, errors are shown\nclustered at the regional level, but for the construction of damage\nprojections, we block-bootstrap the regressions by region 1,000 times to\nprovide a range of parameter estimates with which to sample the projection\nuncertainty (following refs. ^2,31).\n\n### Spatial-lag model\n\nIn Supplementary Fig. 14, we present the results from a spatial-lag model that\nexplores the potential for climate impacts to \u2018spill over\u2019 into spatially\nneighbouring regions. We measure the distance between centroids of each pair\nof sub-national regions and construct spatial lags that take the average of\nthe first-differenced climate variables and their interaction terms over\nneighbouring regions that are at distances of 0\u2013500, 500\u20131,000, 1,000\u20131,500\nand 1,500\u20132000 km (spatial lags, \u2018SL\u2019, 1 to 4). For simplicity, we then assess\na spatial-lag model without temporal lags to assess spatial spillovers of\ncontemporaneous climate impacts. This model takes the form:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{\\Delta {\\rm{l}}{\\rm{g}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{p}}}_{r,y}\\,=\\,{\\mu\n}_{r}+{\\eta }_{y}+{k}_{r}y+\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}=0}^{N}({\\alpha }_{1,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{\\bar{T}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}+{\\alpha }_{2,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{\\bar{T}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}\\times {\\bar{T}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}})\\\\\\\n\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}=0}^{N}({\\alpha\n}_{3,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta {\\mathop{T}\\limits^{ \\sim\n}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}+{\\alpha }_{4,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{\\mathop{T}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}\\times\n{\\hat{T}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}})\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}=0}^{N}({\\alpha }_{5,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{P}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}+{\\alpha }_{6,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{P}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}\\times {P}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}})\\\\\\\n\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}=0}^{N}({\\alpha\n}_{7,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{w}}{\\rm{d}}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}+{\\alpha\n}_{8,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{w}}{\\rm{d}}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}\\times\n{{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{w}}{\\rm{d}}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}})\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}=0}^{N}({\\alpha }_{9,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{x}}{\\rm{t}}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}+{\\alpha\n}_{10,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}\\Delta\n{{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{x}}{\\rm{t}}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}},y}\\times\n{\\bar{T}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}})+{{\\epsilon }}_{r,y},\\end{array}$$\n\n(11)\n\nin which SL indicates the spatial lag of each climate variable and interaction\nterm. In Supplementary Fig. 14, we plot the cumulative marginal effect of each\nclimate variable at different baseline climate conditions by summing the\ncoefficients for each climate variable and interaction term, for example, for\naverage temperature impacts as:\n\n$${\\rm{M}}{\\rm{E}}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}=0}^{N}({\\alpha\n}_{1,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}+{\\alpha\n}_{2,{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}{\\bar{T}}_{r-{\\rm{S}}{\\rm{L}}}).$$\n\n(12)\n\nThese cumulative marginal effects can be regarded as the overall spatially\ndependent impact to an individual region given a one-unit shock to a climate\nvariable in that region and all neighbouring regions at a given value of the\nmoderating variable of the interaction term.\n\n### Constructing projections of economic damage from future climate change\n\nWe construct projections of future climate damages by applying the\ncoefficients estimated in equation (10) and shown in Supplementary Tables 2\u20134\n(when including only lags with statistically significant effects in\nspecifications that limit overfitting; see Supplementary Methods Section 1) to\nprojections of future climate change from the CMIP-6 models. Year-on-year\nchanges in each primary climate variable of interest are calculated to reflect\nthe year-to-year variations used in the empirical models. 30-year moving\naverages of the moderating variables of the interaction terms are calculated\nto reflect the long-term average of climatic conditions that were used for the\nmoderating variables in the empirical models. By using moving averages in the\nprojections, we account for the changing vulnerability to climate shocks based\non the evolving long-term conditions (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11 show that\nthe results are robust to the precise choice of the window of this moving\naverage). Although these climate variables are not differenced, the fact that\nthe bias-adjusted climate models reproduce observed climatological patterns\nacross regions for these moderating variables very accurately (Supplementary\nTable 6) with limited spread across models (<3%) precludes the possibility\nthat any considerable bias or uncertainty is introduced by this methodological\nchoice. However, we impose caps on these moderating variables at the 95th\npercentile at which they were observed in the historical data to prevent\nextrapolation of the marginal effects outside the range in which the\nregressions were estimated. This is a conservative choice that limits the\nmagnitude of our damage projections.\n\nTime series of primary climate variables and moderating climate variables are\nthen combined with estimates of the empirical model parameters to evaluate the\nregression coefficients in equation (10), producing a time series of annual\nGRPpc growth-rate reductions for a given emission scenario, climate model and\nset of empirical model parameters. The resulting time series of growth-rate\nimpacts reflects those occurring owing to future climate change. By contrast,\na future scenario with no climate change would be one in which climate\nvariables do not change (other than with random year-to-year fluctuations) and\nhence the time-averaged evaluation of equation (10) would be zero. Our\napproach therefore implicitly compares the future climate-change scenario to\nthis no-climate-change baseline scenario.\n\nThe time series of growth-rate impacts owing to future climate change in\nregion r and year y, \u03b4_r,y, are then added to the future baseline growth\nrates, \u03c0_r_,y (in log-diff form), obtained from the SSP2 scenario to yield\ntrajectories of damaged GRPpc growth rates, \u03c1_r_,y. These trajectories are\naggregated over time to estimate the future trajectory of GRPpc with future\nclimate impacts:\n\n$${{\\rm{GRPpc}}}_{r,Y}={{\\rm{GRPpc}}}_{r,2020}\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{y=2020}^{Y}{\\rho }_{r,y}={{\\rm{GRPpc}}}_{r,2020}\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\limits_{y=2020}^{Y}\\left(1+{\\pi }_{r,y}+{\\delta }_{r,y}\\right),$$\n\n(13)\n\nin which GRPpc_r,y=2020 is the initial log level of GRPpc. We begin damage\nestimates in 2020 to reflect the damages occurring since the end of the period\nfor which we estimate the empirical models (1979\u20132019) and to match the timing\nof mitigation-cost estimates from most IAMs (see below).\n\nFor each emission scenario, this procedure is repeated 1,000 times while\nrandomly sampling from the selection of climate models, the selection of\nempirical models with different numbers of lags (shown in Supplementary Figs.\n1\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 2\u20134) and bootstrapped estimates of the regression\nparameters. The result is an ensemble of future GRPpc trajectories that\nreflect uncertainty from both physical climate change and the structural and\nsampling uncertainty of the empirical models.\n\n### Estimates of mitigation costs\n\nWe obtain IPCC estimates of the aggregate costs of emission mitigation from\nthe AR6 Scenario Explorer and Database hosted by IIASA^23. Specifically, we\nsearch the AR6 Scenarios Database World v1.1 for IAMs that provided estimates\nof global GDP and population under both a SSP2 baseline and a SSP2-RCP2.6\nscenario to maintain consistency with the socio-economic and emission\nscenarios of the climate damage projections. We find five IAMs that provide\ndata for these scenarios, namely, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM 1.0, REMIND-MAgPIE 1.5,\nAIM/GCE 2.0, GCAM 4.2 and WITCH-GLOBIOM 3.1. Of these five IAMs, we use the\nresults only from the first three that passed the IPCC vetting procedure for\nreproducing historical emission and climate trajectories. We then estimate\nglobal mitigation costs as the percentage difference in global per capita GDP\nbetween the SSP2 baseline and the SSP2-RCP2.6 emission scenario. In the case\nof one of these IAMs, estimates of mitigation costs begin in 2020, whereas in\nthe case of two others, mitigation costs begin in 2010. The mitigation cost\nestimates before 2020 in these two IAMs are mostly negligible, and our choice\nto begin comparison with damage estimates in 2020 is conservative with respect\nto the relative weight of climate damages compared with mitigation costs for\nthese two IAMs.\n\n## Data availability\n\nData on economic production and ERA-5 climate data are publicly available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4681306 (ref. ^62) and\nhttps://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5,\nrespectively.

Point estimates show\nthe effects of a 1 \u00b0C or one standard deviation increase (for temperature and\nprecipitation variables, respectively) at the lower quartile, median and upper\nquartile of the relevant moderating variable (green, orange and purple,\nrespectively) at different lagged periods after the initial shock (note that\nthese are not cumulative effects). Climate variables are used in their first-\ndifferenced form (see main text for discussion) and the moderating climate\nvariables are the annual mean temperature, seasonal temperature difference,\ntotal annual precipitation, number of wet days and annual mean temperature,\nrespectively, in panels a\u2013e (see Methods for further discussion). Error bars\nshow the 95% confidence intervals having clustered standard errors by region.\nThe within-region R^2, Bayesian and Akaike information criteria for the model\nare shown at the top of the figure. This figure shows results with ten lags\nfor each variable to demonstrate the observed levels of persistence, but our\npreferred specifications remove later lags based on the statistical\nsignificance of terms shown above and the information criteria shown in\nExtended Data Fig. 2. The resulting models without later lags are shown in\nSupplementary Figs. 1\u20133.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Incremental lag-selection procedure using information\ncriteria and within-region R^2.\n\nStarting from a panel-based fixed-effects distributed lag model estimating the\neffects of climate on economic growth using the real historical data (as in\nequation (4)) with ten lags for all climate variables (as shown in Extended\nData Fig. 1), lags are incrementally removed for one climate variable at a\ntime. The resulting Bayesian and Akaike information criteria are shown in a\u2013e\nand f\u2013j, respectively, and the within-region R^2 and number of observations in\nk\u2013o and p\u2013t, respectively. Different rows show the results when removing lags\nfrom different climate variables, ordered from top to bottom as annual mean\ntemperature, daily temperature variability, total annual precipitation, the\nnumber of wet days and extreme annual precipitation. Information criteria show\nminima at approximately four lags for precipitation variables and ten to eight\nfor temperature variables, indicating that including these numbers of lags\ndoes not lead to overfitting. See Supplementary Table 1 for an assessment\nusing information criteria to determine whether including further climate\nvariables causes overfitting.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 Damages in our preferred specification that provides\na robust lower bound on the persistence of climate impacts on economic growth\nversus damages in specifications of pure growth or pure level effects.\n\nEstimates of future damages as shown in Fig. 1 but under the emission scenario\nRCP8.5 for three separate empirical specifications: in orange our preferred\nspecification, which provides an empirical lower bound on the persistence of\nclimate impacts on economic growth rates while avoiding assumptions of\ninfinite persistence (see main text for further discussion); in purple a\nspecification of \u2018pure growth effects\u2019 in which the first difference of\nclimate variables is not taken and no lagged climate variables are included\n(the baseline specification of ref. ^2); and in pink a specification of \u2018pure\nlevel effects\u2019 in which the first difference of climate variables is taken but\nno lagged terms are included.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Climate changes in different variables as a function\nof historical interannual variability.\n\nChanges in each climate variable of interest from 1979\u20132019 to 2035\u20132065 under\nthe high-emission scenario SSP5-RCP8.5, expressed as a percentage of the\nhistorical variability of each measure. Historical variability is estimated as\nthe standard deviation of each detrended climate variable over the period\n1979\u20132019 during which the empirical models were identified (detrending is\nappropriate because of the inclusion of region-specific linear time trends in\nthe empirical models). See Supplementary Fig. 13 for changes expressed in\nstandard units. Data on national administrative boundaries are obtained from\nthe GADM database version 3.6 and are freely available for academic use\n(https://gadm.org/).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Contribution of different climate variables to\noverall committed damages.\n\na, Climate damages in 2049 when using empirical models that account for all\nclimate variables, changes in annual mean temperature only or changes in both\nannual mean temperature and one other climate variable (daily temperature\nvariability, total annual precipitation, the number of wet days and extreme\ndaily precipitation, respectively). b, The cumulative marginal effects of an\nincrease in annual mean temperature of 1 \u00b0C, at different baseline\ntemperatures, estimated from empirical models including all climate variables\nor annual mean temperature only. Estimates and uncertainty bars represent the\nmedian and 95% confidence intervals obtained from 1,000 block-bootstrap\nresamples from each of three different empirical models using eight, nine or\nten lags of temperature terms.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 The difference in committed damages between the upper\nand lower quartiles of countries when ranked by GDP and cumulative historical\nemissions.\n\nQuartiles are defined using a population weighting, as are the average\ncommitted damages across each quartile group. The violin plots indicate the\ndistribution of differences between quartiles across the two extreme emission\nscenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) and the uncertainty sampling procedure outlined\nin Methods, which accounts for uncertainty arising from the choice of lags in\nthe empirical models, uncertainty in the empirical model parameter estimates,\nas well as the climate model projections. Bars indicate the median, as well as\nthe 10th and 90th percentiles and upper and lower sixths of the distribution\nreflecting the very likely and likely ranges following the likelihood\nclassification adopted by the IPCC.\n\nExtended Data Table 1 A summary of several physical mechanisms that plausibly\nunderlie the impact of the different climate variables on macroeconomic\ngrowth, with references to empirical evidence\n\nFull size table\n\nExtended Data Table 2 Regression results for the historical effects of\ndifferent climate variables on sub-national economic growth rates in the\nperiod 1979\u20132019\n\nFull size table\n\nExtended Data Table 3 A comparison of the magnitude of estimated economic\ndamage from future climate change across recent panel-based empirical studies\n\nFull size table\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\n### Peer Review File\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
