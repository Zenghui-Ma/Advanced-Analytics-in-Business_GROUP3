Just\nremember to switch off of Steam when the boss walks in.\n\n## Development toolkits work flawlessly\n\nDevelop software out of the box with a vast array of libraries and tools at\nyour disposal. Pop!_OS uses APT and Flatpak package management, meaning it\u2019s\neasy to install, remove, and update all software on the OS.\n\n## Deep Learning\n\nCode life into the machinery of the future.
