The ultimate aim of the project was to try looking at technology\nby starting with the soil.\n\n## Part #1: The field trip\n\nOur adventures began at Poldice mine where we congregated next to the arsenic\nlabyrinth and tin stamps, and trekked across the site to Evan's shaft. This is\none of many (open but protected) shafts on this site, the area surrounding it\nis full of rocks dumped by the miners as they were worthless to them, but they\nare still mineral rich - containing crystals brought up from hundreds of\nfathoms below.\n\nWe had a lot of rock hammers, goggles, face protection and gloves as well as a\nfirst aid kit. The kids didn't really need any explanation at all about what\nwe were doing. Many of the families had grandparents who worked on the mines\nand for the kids it was finally a chance to \"do minecraft for real\".\n\nWe tried to help identify many of the samples - a lot of pyrite, chalcopyrite\nand sphalerite. There are also quite a lot of nice visible green chlorite\ncrystals in the rocks here, and many satisfyingly large quartz crystals. We\nhad hand magnifiers to check on the tiniest specimens and lots of cardboard\nboxes to write your name on and store valuable collections.\n\nWe also found a bit of more recent industrial waste. It turns out people use\nthis site (which is already a kind of ancient environmental disaster) as a\nplace to burn the insulation from cable to sell the extracted copper.\nFittingly this was mostly a copper mine, so you wonder how much of the metal\nbriefly returned home. Due to this there are large lumps of molten plastic\nhere, one piece we found and took back with us contained a perfect imprint of\na leaf, maybe it will last as long as natural fossils do.\n\n## Part #2: The workshop\n\nThe next week we set up in Redruth, in The Elms, where Cornwall Neighbourhoods\nfor Change is based. We decorated the space with photographs of microscopic\nminerals, a small selection of books on mining, minerals and a crystal radio\nconstruction. We set up a collection of mineral samples which we've gradually\nbuilt up, with little brown cards detailing what they were and which mine they\ncame from. None of these are particularly rare, the idea was to make\nidentification of the samples we'd collected at Poldice easier - as one of the\nthings that can make this tricky is that you somehow need to meet a mineral\nface to face to identify it confidently. We also had information on the Bal\nMaidens (as we were doing very similar activities to them in terms of breaking\nup the ore and identifying it) as well as maps of mines near Gwennap, once\nknown as the 'richest square mile in the Old World'.\n\nIn the morning we we joined by the same families who had taken part in the\nfield trip, and a few new faces. We jumped straight into building circuits on\nthe Cardboard Crystal Synthesiser. Starting with lighting up a nice blue LED\nthen making some simple buzzing sounds, each circuit is built by using springs\nto connect components together. This technique seemed to be easier for people\nto get on with than experience we've had trying similar things with\nelectronics breadboards which are much more fiddly. Some of the participants\npreferred to continue with the hammering, in a safe space we had set up\noutside - this included looking for more minerals as well as destroying a\ndonated iPhone so we could look at it under the microscope while others got\nstuck into the more advanced circuits. We also made little cards for the\nspecimens people had collected which they could contribute to the collection\nfor the public to see later on.\n\nWe started adding crystals to the circuit to make stranger, more varied\nsounds. We included quite a lot of raw material for people who didn't come to\nthe field trip (or who didn't want to smash up their rocks further), a mix of\nchalcopyrite, pyrite, galena and marcasite from various locations.\n\nLunch was made by &maggiemakes - a long term collaborator with us who provided\ngeologically inspired folded nourishment including marbled bread and hummus,\nroast pumpkin pastitsio and milopita, a greek style apple cake.\n\n## Part #3: The Open Lab\n\nA few changes to the setup and we were open to the public as part of the Flamm\nFestival. We reserved a few of the workshop participants' synthesisers so we\ncould leave them running as examples, but didn't have a chance to get to some\nof them as we quickly filled up with people. Visitors felt comfortable to\nhappily sit down, pull out all the wires and have a go without asking for\npermission - which is wonderful, but quite unusual, and while intentional (and\npart of the design choices of using obviously hand made materials) was a\nlittle too successful at times!\n\nWe had lots of young families and I think mostly local people, lots of\ndiscussions of technology and mining. One of the most interesting aspects of\ntalking about crystals is the rather wide intersection between material\nscience and the folk religion surrounding crystal properties. I think this is\nquite unique, and fascinating how both groups have to find ways to get on with\neach other (for example some of the best information sources on identification\nonline come from the latter group).\n\nWe had two USB microscopes set up, these are much better than traditional ones\nas they can be connected to a screen and are therefore more accessible for\npeople with eyesight problems. People used these to look at the mineral\nspecimens, crystals people had brought with them, and in several cases, each\nothers' body parts. The other microscope was set up in a kind of history of\ndigital technology area, and could be used to examine bits of iPhones (one the\naforementioned smashed up one and the other more carefully dismantled) as well\nas some silicon chips with clear windows so you can see the transistors.\n\nA really important link here was a crystal radio we made (in a similarly\nconstructed cardboard form) with a lump of pyrite as a diode for converting\nthe radio waves into audio. This was key as it was the connecting point\nbetween the world of minerals and digital technology, as these lumps of\ncrystal ultimately became the first transistors.\n\nWe had a small AM transmitter which could be used with the Cardboard Crystal\nSynthesiser to transmit it to the crystal radio - something we didn't have\ntime to set up, but which would be good to include in future.\n\nWe also had a small PA playing a sound track consisting of recordings made\nwhile prototyping circuits and testing semiconductor material while\nresearching the workshop, as well as field recordings taken while fossicking\nat Great Wheal Busy, which included sounds of rocks, a Geiger counter ticking\naway and occasional hammering.\n\nAll the information on the project, including how to build your own Cardboard\nCrystal Synthesiser are online here (all open source/open hardware). Let us\nknow if you give it a go. Thank you to Flamm Cornwall for supporting this\nproject and Cornwall Neighbourhoods for Change for allowing us to take over\nyour space and providing an amazing group to try all this out on.\n\nprevious post\n\nnext post\n\n### Events\n\n  * Organised Atoms Open Lab (Oct, 2023)\n\n### Notes\n\n  * Organised atoms: what is a semiconductor anyway?
