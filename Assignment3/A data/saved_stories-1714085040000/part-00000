Gitlin - 4/25/2024, 4:33 PM\n\nEnlarge / Honda is investing CAD$15 billion (US $11 billion) to expand EV\nmanufacturing in North America with four sites in Ontario, Canada.\n\nHonda\n\n#### reader comments\n\n59\n\nHonda announced today that it will spend $11 billion to expand its electric\nvehicle manufacturing presence in North America. The Japanese automaker\nalready has a number of factories in the US, Mexico, and Canada, and it's this\nlast one that will benefit from the expansion, with four EV-related plants\nplanned for Ontario.\n\nHonda says it has begun evaluating requirements for what it's calling an\n\"innovative and environmentally responsible\" EV factory and a standalone EV\nbattery plant in Alliston, Ontario, which is already home to Honda's two\nexisting Canadian manufacturing facilities.\n\nAdditionally, the automaker wants to set up another two sites as joint\nventures. One will be a plant that processes cathode active materials and\ntheir precursors\u2014the various elements like nickel and manganese that are\ncombined with lithium in lithium-ion batteries\u2014set up in a partnership with\nPOSCO Future M, a South Korean battery material and chemical company. (POSCO\nis already working with General Motors on another joint venture battery\nprecursor material facility in Betancour, Quebec, that is supposed to become\noperational in 2026.)\n\nA second joint venture will be a partnership with Asahi Kasei, which will\nmanufacture battery separators, the material that keeps the anode and cathode\napart. The locations of these two joint ventures have not yet been announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonda thinks it will be able to start making EVs in Ontario in 2028 and says\nthe assembly plant will have the capacity to build 240,000 EVs per year.\nMeanwhile, the battery plant is planned to have an annual output of 36 GWh.\n\n\"Honda is making progress in our global initiatives toward the realization of\nour 2050 carbon neutrality goal,\" said Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe. \"In North\nAmerica, following the initiative to establish our EV production system\ncapability in the US, we will now begin formal discussions toward the\nestablishment of a comprehensive EV value chain here in Canada, with the\nsupport of the governments of Canada and Ontario. We will strengthen our EV\nsupply system and capability with an eye toward a future increase in EV demand\nin North America.\"\n\nThese investments in EV manufacturing by Honda are in addition to $700 million\nthat it has spent retooling some of its factories in Ohio for electrification,\nplus a joint venture battery factory with LG Energy Solutions, also in Ohio,\nthat has risen in cost to $4.4 billion. Honda says it expects to begin\nproduction of an electric sedan, shown off at CES earlier this year, in Ohio\nin late 2025. The brand currently has a single EV for the US market\u2014the Honda\nPrologue\u2014which shares one of GM's Ultium platforms. It is also developing an\nEV with Sony under the Afeela brand.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n59\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
