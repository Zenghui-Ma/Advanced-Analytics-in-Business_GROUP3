(AP) \u2014 NASA has finally heard back from Voyager 1 again\nin a way that makes sense.\n\nThe most distant spacecraft from Earth stopped sending back understandable\ndata last November. Flight controllers traced the blank communication to a bad\ncomputer chip and rearranged the spacecraft\u2019s coding to work around the\ntrouble.\n\nNASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California declared success after\nreceiving good engineering updates late last week. The team is still working\nto restore transmission of the science data.\n\nIt takes 22 1/2 hours to send a signal to Voyager 1, more than 15 billion\nmiles (24 billion kilometers) away in interstellar space. The signal travel\ntime is double that for a round trip.\n\nContact was never lost, rather it was like making a phone call where you can\u2019t\nhear the person on the other end, a JPL spokeswoman said Tuesday.\n\nLaunched in 1977 to study Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 has been exploring\ninterstellar space \u2014 the space between star systems \u2014 since 2012. Its twin,\nVoyager 2, is 12.6 billion miles (20 billion kilometers) away and still\nworking fine.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nNASA is seeking a faster and cheaper way to bring Mars samples to Earth\n\nAs airplane makers struggle to meet demand, Morocco wants to become a\nmanufacturing hub\n\nEuropean Space Agency adds 5 new astronauts in only fourth class since 1978.\nOver 20,000 applied\n\n## ___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
