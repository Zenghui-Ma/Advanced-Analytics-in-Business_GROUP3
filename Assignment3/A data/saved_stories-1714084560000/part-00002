Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these\n> models for quick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate\n> whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's\n> visibility. We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a\n> carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can\n> significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top\n> recommendation. To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of\n> fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products:\n> one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that\n> usually ranks second. We observe that the strategic text sequence\n> significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their\n> chances of appearing as the top recommendation. This ability to manipulate\n> LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable\n> competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market\n> competition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how\n> webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing\n> LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-\n> driven search services.
