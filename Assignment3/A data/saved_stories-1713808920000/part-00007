How retro!\n\nAs with every other piece of increasingly creepy and intrusive home security\ntech, we have lots of questions. What if, for instance, a militant bird lover\nbuys a Paintcam and decides to gas their neighbors' cats when they come\na-hunting? And what if racists looking for an excuse to shoot at minorities\nuse this kind of technology?\n\nMost importantly, however, we're dying to know: who the hell asked for this?\n\nMore on AI hometech: Apple Secretly Working on AI Robot That Follows You\nAround The House\n\nShare This Article\n\nLeafy Greens\n\nAstronomers Use Huge Space Telescope Camera to Photograph Broccoli\n\n9.9.20, 11:35 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nA New Lensless Camera Transforms How Scientists See the Cosmos\n\n12.26.17, 11:38 AM EST\n\nRead More\n\nChina's CCTV System Tracked Down a Reporter in Only Seven Minutes\n\nUpdated 12.18.17, 4:43 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\nApple Just Released New Details About iPhone X Facial Recognition\n\nUpdated 11.30.17, 4:01 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
