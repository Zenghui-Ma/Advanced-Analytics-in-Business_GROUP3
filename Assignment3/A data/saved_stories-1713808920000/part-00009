Here\u2019s how I learned to cope\n\nBusy places and unexpected events used to send me into meltdown on holiday. An\nautism diagnosis helped me to adapt my plans and rediscover the joy of\ntravelling\n\nAllie Mason\n\nMon 22 Apr 2024 08.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nWandering hand-in-hand through the medieval streets of Bologna, my boyfriend\nand I were in awe of the sweeping porticoes and distinctive rust-red brickwork\nof the city. It was our first holiday together. We\u2019d wanted to find somewhere\nbeyond the obvious that would marry our respective interests in architecture\nand history. Bologna was the perfect fit.\n\nWe admired the Church of Santa Maria della Vita, with its imposing baroque\ninterior, lavishly decorated in colourful frescoes and marble carvings. We\ncaught a little red and blue express train up into the hills to the Santuario\ndella Madonna di San Luca, and climbed the bell tower of the Basilica di San\nPetronio for panoramic views across the city.\n\nBut after one particularly long, hot day on our feet, with our stomachs\nclamouring to be fed, my mood began to shift. With the setting of the sun came\nthe rising of my rage, as we struggled to agree on where we wanted to eat. In\na city nicknamed La Grassa (\u201cthe fat one\u201d), we weren\u2019t lacking in options; in\nfact, it was the sheer number of well-reviewed eateries that was overwhelming.\n\nThe bustling streets of Bologna. Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty Images\n\nEventually we decided on pizza, and my boyfriend anxiously led us through sun-\ndappled alleyways, seeking out a little hole-in-the-wall spot with stellar\nreviews on Google. Looking back now, I\u2019m ashamed of my reaction once we\narrived. Instead of excitedly tucking into the steaming, cheese-drenched\ndeliciousness before me, I burst into tears, refusing to order. And why?\n\nBecause they were slices.\n\nIn my mind, getting pizza meant that we\u2019d be presented with a whole pizza. The\nidea of just grabbing a slice or two felt abhorrently wrong. It truly felt to\nme, in that moment, like I was being asked to do the impossible.\n\nInstead, we had to find a standard bistro and get me the right kind of pizza.\nScrolling through photographs from that trip for this article, I find a\nsnapshot of my boyfriend opposite me at the table, looking as if he\u2019d just\n(barely) survived the fury of the Visigoths during the sacking of Rome.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until three years later \u2013 in spring 2020, when I was diagnosed as\nautistic \u2013 that this fragment of my life story, and many others like it,\nfinally began to make sense.\n\nBeing autistic means that life is a challenge, every day, in myriad tiny ways\nmost others cannot see. Autistic people often grapple with sensory, social and\ncommunication challenges that manifest differently in each of us. As a\ntoddler, for instance, I couldn\u2019t stand the touch of grass on my skin. My\nparents could pop me down on a blanket by our tent during camping trips, safe\nin the knowledge that I wouldn\u2019t stray. The same went for sand \u2013 putting me\ndown to build a sandcastle on the beach only led to banshee-esque wailing\nuntil someone picked me up. When I got older, I preferred to stay by the tent\nand read my books than risk the chaotic din of the campsite playground.\n\nI\u2019ve also always found it difficult when confronted with the unexpected. That\ncould be anything, from a last-minute change of plans to something simply not\nturning out the way I\u2019d pictured it in my head.\n\nRelentlessly busy places are a terrifying prospect for those of us predisposed\nto sensory overwhelm. The best way I can describe how I experience this\nsensation is to ask you to imagine that the whole world has climbed into your\nchest. It then sits there, heavy and loud and bright, thrumming with energy,\ntoo much energy, more than any one person could hold within themselves. And\nyet, that\u2019s what\u2019s expected of us, day in, day out.\n\nFortunately, societal awareness of how autistic people interact with public\nspaces has grown over the past few years, thanks to the rise of lived\nexperiences shared on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. The thriving\nautistic creator communities online were a lifebelt for me when I was first\ndiagnosed, providing both insights into my own behaviour and suggesting coping\nmechanisms.\n\n> I now have a kit for mitigating sensory overwhelm: sunglasses, earplugs, a\n> fidget toy or two and a safe food to snack on\n\nInitiatives such as the sunflower lanyard scheme are also having a real impact\non how employees in train stations, airports, bus terminals and so on are\ntrained in making these places more accessible to those with hidden\ndisabilities.\n\nWhat I have learned is that many challenges can be overcome with sufficient\nplanning and support from those around me. Through much trial and error over\nthe last four years, I\u2019m making real progress towards learning how to adapt my\nholiday plans to accommodate my needs. I now have a self-made kit for\nmitigating sensory overwhelm that I take with me whenever I travel:\nsunglasses, noise-isolating earplugs, noise-cancelling headphones, a fidget\ntoy or two and a safe food to snack on (a favourite cereal bar, for example).\nHaving avoided meltdowns by using these items in the past, I now can\u2019t imagine\ntravelling without them.\n\nThe process of writing my book, The Autistic Guide to Adventure, has provided\nmany useful insights too. Designed to introduce younger readers from the\nautistic community to a variety of different outdoor activities, the book\nsuggests how to best approach them from sensory, social and communication\nperspectives.\n\nTake kayaking, for instance, a popular holiday activity in the UK thanks to\nour miles upon miles of public waterways and easily accessible coastline. I\u2019ve\nkayaked on family holidays since a young age. Before I knew I was autistic,\nhowever, I\u2019d never have thought to give myself extra time to get used to\nsitting in a new boat in a new location, testing the feel of a buoyancy aid or\nholding the paddle properly. Yet something as simple as taking the opportunity\nto do that \u2013 on dry land, before the kayak even gets near the water \u2013 can make\na real difference to how comfortable and confident an autistic person might\nfeel about trying this new activity. Most activity providers are understanding\nand would be happy to facilitate this, if you let them know in advance.\n\nAllie and a furry friend.

These help to maintain balance, something that\nmany autistic people find hard because of difficulties regulating their\nvestibular system.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to The Traveller\n\nFree newsletter\n\nGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as\nwell as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

But if we each plan ahead and choose what to do or where to\ngo based on our known sensory sensitivities, communication preferences and\nsocial battery life, every trip has the potential to be perfect just for us.\n\nMost recently, my boyfriend and I took a much-anticipated trip to the Arctic\nCircle, visiting Troms\u00f8. There\u2019s a key difference between this holiday and our\nstay in Bologna five years earlier: the weather. It\u2019s common for autistic\npeople to have strong preferences when it comes to temperature \u2013 in my case,\nI\u2019ll always choose cold over hot.\n\nThat\u2019s why Troms\u00f8 in December was a sensory dream for me. Plunged into polar\nnight, the light was never brighter than a muted lilac haze for a few short\nhours around midday. The temperature was consistently below freezing; the snow\nlay piled in marshmallow-soft heaps along pavements and roadsides. It was as\nfar a cry from the lively streets and humid air of summer in Bologna as you\ncould get, and it was perfect.\n\nWinter twilight at Fjellheisen, Troms\u00f8. Photograph: Preeyaporn Kaewsaard/Getty\nImages\n\nLearning from previous experience, we planned exactly where we wanted to eat\nduring the trip. We spent several cheerful mealtimes huddled by the fire pit\nat Raketten Bar and enjoyed P\u00f8lse, a hotdog stand in a sunshine-yellow kiosk\ndating back to 1911.\n\nAutistic people often prefer the company of animals to other humans, but it\u2019s\nnot something I\u2019d ever thought to factor into my travel plans before. In\nTroms\u00f8, we ended up spending three out of our five days on activities\ninvolving animals: huskies, whales and reindeer. It was, without a doubt, one\nof the best decisions we could have made.\n\nThe joy of losing myself in a frenzied pack of newfound canine friends\nradiates from my face in photos from the day we went husky sledding.\n\n> When I close my eyes, I can still see the play of lavender light on the\n> snow-capped mountains surrounding Troms\u00f8\n\nGiven that travel is something I treasure, it\u2019s a relief to realise that my\nability to do it is not limited by being neurodivergent. On the contrary, I\ntruly believe some of my many travel experiences have been \u2013 and will continue\nto be \u2013 enhanced by the fact that my brain works on a different wavelength.\n\nWhen I close my eyes, I can still see the play of lavender light on the snow-\ncapped mountains surrounding Troms\u00f8. I\u2019m immediately transported back to a\nplace that felt like home to my soul, soothed without having to take even a\nstep outside.\n\nThe Autistic Guide to Adventure by Allie Mason is published by Jessica\nKingsley (\u00a314.99).
