In 2022,\nscientists in Canada published a study, based on mice research, suggesting a\nrisk of CWD transmission to humans.\n\nHere's what you need to know about chronic wasting disease and whether you\nneed to worry about it.\n\n## Researchers identify troubling case involving 2 deaths\n\nResearchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio\nhave reported how two hunters who ate venison from a deer population known to\nhave CWD died in 2022 after developing sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\n(CJD), which is a neurological disease like CWD.\n\nThe second man to die, who was 77, suffered \"rapid-onset confusion and\naggression,\" the researchers said, and died within a month despite treatment.\n\n\"The patient\u2019s history, including a similar case in his social group, suggests\na possible novel animal-to-human transmission of CWD,\" they wrote in the case\nreport, presented earlier this month at the annual meeting of the American\nAcademy of Neurology, and published in peer-reviewed journal Neurology.\n\nThe researchers did not say where the men lived or hunted. But the highest\nconcentration of CWD-infected deer can be found in Kansas, Nebraska, Wisconsin\nand Wyoming, according to CDC and US. Geological Survey reports.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in distinguishing between the diseases, the\nresearchers said the case does not represent a proven case of transmission.\nHowever, \"this cluster emphasizes the need for further investigation into the\npotential risks of consuming CWD-infected deer and its implications for public\nhealth,\" they wrote.\n\n'Zombie deer disease': What to know about chronic wasting disease and its\nspread in the US.\n\n## What is 'zombie deer disease'? What are prion diseases?\n\nAlso known as chronic wasting disease, \"zombie deer disease\" is a prion\ndisease, a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects\ndeer, elk, moose and other animals, the CDC says.\n\nIn prion diseases, the abnormal folding of certain \"prion proteins\" leads to\nbrain damage and other symptoms, according to the CDC. Prion diseases, which\nusually progress rapidly and are always fatal, can affect humans and animals.\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD),\nwhich is a form of mad cow disease, are prion diseases found in people.\n\nMad cow disease is an example of a prion disease that can spread from cattle\nto humans, and some researchers have likened \"zombie deer disease\" to it.\n\nFor instance, with mad cow disease, it usually took four to six years from\ninfection for cattle to show symptoms, according to the Food and Drug\nAdministration. Deer may have an incubation period of up to two years before\nthe onset of symptoms. So, the animals could have the disease but look normal\nuntil the onset of symptoms, such as weight loss, notes the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.\n\nThe development of vCJD in humans in the wake of mad cow disease \u2013 its\nofficial name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE \u2013 through eating\nmeat from contaminated cattle has concerned scientists about the possible\ntransmission of chronic wasting disease (CWD) to humans.\n\n## Can 'zombie deer disease' be transmitted to humans?\n\nEven though there's been no known confirmed case of deer-to-human transmission\nof \"zombie deer disease,' concerns have risen since officials found CWD in a\ndead deer in Yellowstone National Park in November.\n\n\"As of yet, there has been no transmission from deer or elk to humans,\"\nJennifer Mullinax, associate professor of wildlife ecology and management at\nthe University of Maryland, told BBC. \"However, given the nature of prions,\nCDC and other agencies have supported all efforts to keep any prion disease\nout of the food chain.\"\n\nShould CWD transmit to humans, it could create a \"potential crisis\" similar to\nwhat mad cow disease caused, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for\nInfectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told\nBBC.\n\n\"However, it\u2019s important to note that BSE and CWD prions differ structurally\nand we do not yet know whether the pathology and clinical presentation would\nbe comparable if CWD transmission to humans were to occur,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, chronic wasting disease continues to spread to more states, with\nthe most recent being Indiana. The disease was detected earlier this month in\na male white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the state, which borders\npart of Michigan where CWD had previously been detected, according to the\nCenter for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey updated its tracking of chronic wasting disease on\nFriday to include 33 states (adding Indiana), as well as four Canadian\nprovinces and four other countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden and South Korea).\n\nContributing: Sara Chernikoff and Julia Gomez.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?
