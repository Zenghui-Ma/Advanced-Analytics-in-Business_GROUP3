Sorry, those\nare science projects. Fusion is a Manhattan Project or an Apollo Project...\nThe rest of this is more like retooling for World War II, except with everyone\nplaying on the same team.\n\n\u2014 Saul Griffith, on converting the world to clean energy\n\nThis has not been a scientist\u2019s war; it has been a war in which all have had a\npart.\n\n\u2014 Vannevar Bush, on World War II\n\n# What can a technologist do about climate change?\n\n(A personal view)\n\nBret Victor / November 2015\n\nThis started with a tweet. I\u2019m embarrassed how often that happens.\n\nFrustrated by a sense of global mispriorities, I blurted out some snarky and\nmildly regrettable tweets on the lack of attention to climate change in the\ntech industry (Twitter being a sublime medium for the snarky and regrettable).\nClimate change is the problem of our time, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem, and most\nof our problem-solvers are assuming that someone else will solve it.\n\nI\u2019m grateful to one problem-solver, who wrote to ask for specifics \u2014\n\nBret Victor @worrydream - Aug 11 Worrying about sentient AI as the ice caps\nmelt is like standing on the tracks as the train rushes in, worrying about\nbeing hit by lightning\n\nBret Victor @worrydream - Aug 12 If any \"founders\" out there want to \"disrupt\"\nour 401 ppm atmospheric CO2, or \"moonshot\" ocean acidification, that would be\ncool\n\nBret Victor @worrydream - Aug 12 \"minimum viable planet\"\n\n\u201cHow do you think the tech community (startup community, or any community) can\ncontribute to tech and/or policy solutions on a global scale?\u201d\n\nThe notes below are my attempt to answer that question.\n\nThis is a \u201cpersonal view\u201d, biased by my experiences and idiosyncrasies. I\u2019ve\nfollowed the climate situation for some time, including working on Al Gore\u2019s\nbook Our Choice, but I can\u2019t hope to convey the full picture \u2014 just a sliver\nthat\u2019s visible from where I\u2019m standing. I urge you to talk to many scientists\nand engineers involved in climate analysis and energy, and see for yourself\nwhat the needs are and how you can contribute.\n\nThis is aimed at people in the tech industry, and is more about what you can\ndo with your career than at a hackathon. I\u2019m not going to discuss policy and\nregulation, although they\u2019re no less important than technological innovation.\nA good way to think about it, via Saul Griffith, is that it\u2019s the role of\ntechnologists to create options for policy-makers.\n\neverything that needs to be done about climate change\n\nwhat you\u2019ll read about here\n\nI\u2019m also only going to directly discuss technology related to the primary\ncause of climate change (the burning of fossil fuels), although there are\ntechnological needs related to other causes (livestock, deforestation, global\npoverty), as well as mitigating symptoms of climate change (droughts and\nstorms, ecosystem damage, mass migrations).\n\nFunding Public investment Private investment\n\nProducing Energy The stuff around the thing Computation\n\nMoving Energy Networking (moving in space) Storage (moving in time)\n\nConsuming Energy Transportation (consuming what?)

Available funding\nsources, and the interests and attitudes of the funders, have always had an\nenormous effect on what technology comes to exist in the world. In a time of\ncrisis, it\u2019s the responsibility of those holding the capital to sponsor work\non averting the crisis. That is not happening.\n\n### Public investment\n\nThe primary source of public funding in the U.S. for \u201cI\u2019ve got a crazy new\nidea for energy\u201d is ARPA-E. Last year it granted $280 million.\n\nIncremental innovation is supported by the DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency &\nRenewable Energy, which has a $2 billion annual budget for a wide range of\ninitiatives.\n\nThe DOE also funds the national labs, which do a lot of energy research.\n\nThe NSF\u2019s Energy for Sustainability program gives out $18 million annually for\nacademic research.\n\nPublic funding can also be found at the state level, such as the California\nEnergy Commission\u2019s EPIC program, which has a $130 million annual budget.\n\nPossibly the largest source of public funding is in the form of financing\nprograms, such as loan guarantees and tax credits.\n\n> [The U.S. energy loan program] literally kick-started the whole utility-\n> scale photovoltaic industry... The program funded the first of five huge\n> solar projects in the West... Before that, developers couldn\u2019t get money\n> from private lenders. But now, with proven business models, they can.\n> (source)\n\nIt\u2019s great that this funding exists, but let\u2019s be clear \u2014 it\u2019s a pittance. If\nwe take Saul Griffith\u2019s quote at face value and accept that addressing climate\nchange will take a concerted global effort comparable to World War II,\nconsider that the U.S. spent about $4 trillion in today\u2019s dollars to \u201cfight\nthe enemy\u201d at that time. Our present enemy is more threatening, and our\nfinancial commitment to the fight is several orders of magnitude off.\n\n> (Naomi Klein) There is... no scenario in which we can avoid wartime levels\n> of spending in the public sector \u2014 not if we are serious about preventing\n> catastrophic levels of warming, and minimizing the destructive potential of\n> the coming storms. (source)\n\nIn the meantime, the fossil fuel industry is being subsidized at about half a\ntrillion dollars a year.\n\nPublic funding for clean energy is a problem to be solved. It\u2019s not a\ntechnology problem. But it\u2019s a blocker that prevents us from getting to the\ntechnology problems.\n\n### Private investment\n\nU.S. military spending per year $610 billon (source)\n\nU.S. venture capital investment per year $48 billon (source)\n\nOffice of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy budget $2 billon (source)\n\nARPA-E budget $0.3 billon (source)\n\nNSF Energy for Sustainability budget $0.02 billon (source)\n\nYou can read the story of the so-called \u201ccleantech bubble\u201d. In brief \u2014 between\n2008 and 2011, about $15 billion of enthusiastic venture capital went into\nenergy-related startups. There were a few major failures, investors got\nspooked, and cleantech became taboo.\n\nLate-stage venture funding has dwindled, and early-stage funding has all but\ndisappeared. Founders spend their days scrounging instead of building.\nConsider the American energy storage company Primus Power, which had to raise\nits series C from a South African platinum company, and series D from\nKazakhstan.\n\nThe human race uses 18 terawatts, and will for the foreseeable future. So\nthere are basically only two scenarios for investors as a collective:\n\nlate-stage venture capital funding in cleantech (source)(data)\n\nearly-stage venture capital funding in cleantech (source)(data)\n\n(a) invest in clean energy immediately; clean energy takes over the $6\ntrillion global energy market; investors get a nice piece of that.\n\n(b) don\u2019t invest in clean energy immediately; fossil fuels burn past our\ncarbon budget; investors inherit a cinder.\n\nScenario (a) seems like the most rational plan for everyone, in the long term.\nThe fact that most investors\u2019 short-term incentives are structured to prefer\nscenario (b) is a critical problem to be solved. Again, it\u2019s not a technology\nproblem, but it\u2019s a blocker that prevents us from getting to the technology\nproblems.\n\nworld carbon emissions (in GtCO_2/yr) and carbon budget (source)\n\ndrag\n\nFunding Public investment Private investment\n\nProducing Energy The stuff around the thing Computation\n\nMoving Energy Networking (moving in space) Storage (moving in time)\n\nConsuming Energy Transportation (consuming what?)

For the purposes of this essay, that will mean\nmostly via solar and wind, although geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, and\nnuclear will all have parts to play.\n\nThis is well-known, but the scale and rate of change required is often\nunappreciated. Saul Griffith has a good bit about this, suggesting that what\u2019s\nneeded is not throwing up a few solar panels, but a major industrial shift\ncomparable to retooling for World War II.\n\nIn 1940 through 1942, U.S. war-related industrial production tripled each\nyear. That\u2019s over twice as fast as Moore\u2019s law.\n\nU.S. gross national product, WWII (source)\n\nIn order to avoid the more catastrophic climate scenarios, global production\nand adoption of clean energy technology will have to scale at similar rates \u2014\nbut continuously for 15 years or more.\n\nThe catalyst for such a scale-up will necessarily be political. But even with\npolitical will, it can\u2019t happen without technology that\u2019s capable of scaling,\nand economically viable at scale.\n\nAs technologists, that\u2019s where we come in.\n\noptimistic roadmap for 100% clean energy in U.S. by 2050, Mark Jacobson et al\n(source)\n\n### The stuff around the thing\n\nMany people seem to assume that breakthoughs in clean energy will come in the\nform of new generation technology \u2014 fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells,\nthat sort of thing.\n\nThose will be good things to have! But there\u2019s more than enough power\navailable to today\u2019s solar cells and wind turbines \u2014 if only the systems were\ncheaper, simpler, and scalable. Here are a few examples of the kinds of\nprojects I find interesting:\n\nMakani hoists its wind turbine to high altitudes with a flying wing instead of\na tower.\n\n> Makani\u2019s energy kite actually operates on the same aerodynamic principles as\n> a conventional wind turbine, but is able to replace tons of steel with\n> lightweight electronics, advanced materials, and smart software. By using a\n> flexible tether, energy kites eliminate 90% of the materials used in\n> conventional wind turbines, resulting in lower costs. (source)\n\nAltaeros uses a blimp.\n\n> The Altaeros Buoyant Airborne Turbine reduces the second largest cost of\n> wind energy \u2013 the installation and transport cost \u2013 by up to 90 percent,\n> through a containerized deployment that does not require a tower, crane, or\n> cement foundation. (source)\n\nSunfolding does solar tracking with pneumatically-actuated plastic soda\nbottles.\n\n> Actuation and control are the highest cost components of today\u2019s tracking\n> systems. Together they account for nearly 50% of the tracking system cost.\n> We replace both with our new approach to tracker design. (source)\n\nThese projects aren\u2019t about better generators. They are about dramatically\nreducing the cost of the stuff around the generator.\n\nSome of the best news of the last few years is the plunging cost of solar\npower. It\u2019s instructive to look at what exactly is responsible for the drop.\nIt\u2019s partly cheaper solar panels, due to improved conversion efficiency and\nfalling manufacturing costs. But panels are now so cheap that they only make\nup 25% of the total system cost.\n\nlevelized cost of solar photovoltaic power ($/MWh) (source)\n\nThe majority of the price drop is now due to better inverters, and better\nmounting racks, and better installation techniques, and better ways for solar\ncompanies to interact with customers. There\u2019s innovation everywhere, and you\ndon\u2019t need to be on the photovoltaic manufacturing line in order to play.\n\nThe reason that these reductions in system cost are potentially so significant\nis the tipping point once solar and wind are consistently cheaper than fossil\nfuels and can be scaled up to meet demand.\n\nMy point here is that there are many ways of contributing toward innovation in\nthe production of clean energy without going off and building a fusion\nreactor. Look at the stuff around the things.\n\n### Computation\n\nEven for something as physical as power generation, the right software can\nmake a signficant contribution. A few examples that come to mind:\n\nKalyan Veeramachaneni et al at MIT used modern probabilistic modeling to\ndramatically improve the process of estimating wind capacity at a location,\ncalculating more accurate predictions in a fraction of the time.\n\n> We talked with people in the wind industry, and we found that they were\n> using a very, very simplistic mechanism to estimate the wind resource at a\n> site. (source)\n\nThey didn\u2019t invent a windmill; they invented an algorithm to determine where\nthe windmill should go. It\u2019s now a startup.\n\nKL divergence (wrongness) of wind estimates from ground truth (source)\n\nJohn Dabiri\u2019s team at Caltech used aerodynamic analysis to dramatically\nimprove the energy production and compactness of wind farms. Their work\ncomputes the optimal placement of vertical turbines so they reinforce each\nother instead of interfering, making possible large arrays of small turbines.\n\n> This approach dramatically extends the reach of wind energy, as smaller wind\n> turbines can be installed in many places that larger systems cannot,\n> especially in built environments. ... Favorable economics stem from an\n> orders-of-magnitude reduction in the number of components in a new\n> generation of simple, mass-manufacturable (even 3D-printable), vertical-axis\n> wind turbines. (source)\n\nAgain, they didn\u2019t invent a new windmill; they used computational modeling to\nmake viable a much smaller and cheaper existing windmill.\n\nfootprint power density (watts extracted per square meter of land) (source)\n\nMakani and Sunfolding both sprung from Saul Griffith\u2019s Otherlab, and much of\nOtherlab\u2019s magic lies in their code. A common theme is replacing physical\nmaterial with dynamic control systems:\n\n> [Makani\u2019s kite\u2019s] computer system uses GPS and other sensors along with\n> thousands of real-time calculations to guide the kite to the flight path\n> with the strongest and steadiest winds for maximum energy generation.\n> (source)\n\n> (Saul Griffith) The really big themes I\u2019d like to emphasize, because we need\n> more people to join the club, so to speak, is the importance of being able\n> to substitute a control system \u2014 sensors and computers \u2014 for actual\n> materials... We are actually now replacing atoms with bits. (source)\n\nas well as creating new software tools for design and manufacturing:\n\n> Griffith\u2019s team had to write modeling software for the inflatables, because\n> nobody had done anything like it before. But Otherlab creates its own\n> software much of the time anyway. The 123D line of 3D modeling software\n> offered by Autodesk grew out of one of his projects.\n>\n> \u201cWe write all of our own tools, no matter what project we\u2019re building,\u201d\n> Griffith says. \u201cPretty much anything that we\u2019re doing requires some sort of\n> design tool that didn\u2019t exist before. In fact, the design tools that we\n> write to do the projects that we\u2019re doing are a sort of product in and of\n> themselves.\u201d (source)\n\n123D Make\n\nMy point here is that software isn\u2019t just for drawing pixels and manipulating\ndatabases \u2014 it underlies a lot of the innovation even in physical technology.\nMore on this below.\n\nFunding Public investment Private investment\n\nProducing Energy The stuff around the thing Computation\n\nMoving Energy Networking (moving in space) Storage (moving in time)\n\nConsuming Energy Transportation (consuming what?)

The ISO exists because\nevery megawatt that is generated at a power plant must be immediately consumed\nsomewhere else. There\u2019s no buffer in the system, aside from a few reservoirs\nwhere they can occasionally pump water uphill.\n\nSo they\u2019ve evolved a complex apparatus for forecasting energy demand, and\nsending realtime price signals to producers to make them adjust their output\nas needed. This is becoming a formidable challenge as more and more\nintermittent (thus, unpredictable) renewables like solar and wind come online,\nand dirty and expensive peaker plants have to be ramped up or down on a\nmoment\u2019s notice to balance them out.\n\nCalifornia ISO supply and demand in gigawatts, on Oct 22, 2015 (source)\n\nEverything about today\u2019s power grid, from this centralized control to the\naging machinery performing transmission and distribution, is not suitable for\nclean energy. The power grid was designed to take input from a handful of\ntightly-regulated power plants running in synchrony, not millions of solar\nroofs. And it was designed for power plants that were always available and\npredictable, not intermittent sources like the sun and wind.\n\n> If everyone in Los Angeles put solar panels on their roofs, plugged electric\n> cars into their garages and used smart power-meters today, something\n> interesting would happen. The electric grid would collapse. (source)\n\nIn order for clean energy to work, it needs to get from where and when it is\ngenerated, to where and when it needed. The \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d call for\nnetworking and storage, respectively.\n\nschematic of power grid in 1935, and also now (source)\n\n### Energy networking (moving energy in space)\n\nThe key idea that made the internet possible was the move from centralized\ncircuit-switched networks to distributed packet-switching protocols, where\ndata could \u201cfind its way\u201d from sender to receiver.\n\nNow it\u2019s energy that needs to find its way.\n\n> The power network... will undergo the same kind of architectural\n> transformation in the next decades that computing and the communication\n> network has gone through in the last two.\n\n> We envision a future network with hundreds of millions of active endpoints.\n> These are not merely passive loads as are most endpoints today, but\n> endpoints that may generate, sense, compute, communicate, and actuate. They\n> will create both a severe risk and a tremendous opportunity: an\n> interconnected system of hundreds of millions of distributed energy\n> resources (DERs) introducing rapid, large, and random fluctuations in power\n> supply and demand...\n>\n> As infrastructure deployment progresses, the new bottleneck will be the need\n> for overarching frameworks, foundational theories, and practical algorithms\n> to manage a fully [data-centric] power network. (source)\n\nThis is an algorithms problem! It\u2019s TCP/IP for energy. Think of these\nalgorithms as hybrids of distributed networking protocols and financial\ntrading algorithms \u2014 they are routing energy as well as participating in a\nmarket.\n\nTCP/IP spawned quite an industry of infrastructure and applications. It\u2019s\nlikely that something similar will happen as the smart grid gets underway. One\nDOE-funded project attempting to provide the infrastructure for such an\nindustry is VOLTTRON, an \u201cIntelligent Agent Platform for the Smart Grid\u201d.\n\n> VOLTTRON is an innovative distributed control and sensing software platform.\n> Its source code has been released, making it possible for researchers and\n> others to use this tool to build applications for more efficiently managing\n> energy use among appliances and devices, including heating, ventilation and\n> air conditioning (HVAC) systems, lighting, electric vehicles and others.\n> (source)\n\n> VOLTTRON is not an application such as demand response \u2013 demand response can\n> be implemented as an application on top of VOLTTRON.\n>\n> VOLTTRON is open, flexible and modular, and already benefits from community\n> support and development. (source)\n\nProtocols for moving data around were the big thing for a few decades. Then it\nwas moving money around. The next big thing will be moving energy around.\n\n### Energy storage (moving energy in time)\n\nRelying on sun and wind is only possible if we can store up their energy for\nwhen it\u2019s not sunny or windy. Many people assume that we\u2019ll \u201cjust use\nbatteries\u201d, but the scale is off by a few orders of magnitude. All the\nbatteries on earth can store less than ten minutes of the world\u2019s energy. At\ncurrently anticipated growth rates, we wouldn\u2019t have the batteries we need for\neighty years.\n\nGrid-scale energy storage is perhaps the most critical technology problem in\nclean energy. When I visited the ISO, the operator was just about imploring us\nto invent better energy storage technologies, because they would change the\ngame entirely.\n\nactual and required battery growth rates (power in terawatts, log scale)\n(source)\n\nTesla recently announced their home battery initiative, and a Gigafactory to\nproduce them.\n\nMy friend Danielle Fong started LightSail Energy to store energy by\ncompressing air with an engine.\n\nThere are various companies pursuing variations on batteries, compressors,\nflywheels, thermal storage, water pumps, and more.\n\nParticularly charming is Advanced Rail Energy Storage, whose proposal is\n\n> using lower-cost power to drive a train uphill and then let the train roll\n> downhill to produce power when market prices are high. (source)\n\nThere\u2019s also something delightful about the image of CALMAC\u2019s IceBank\u00ae, Ice\nEnergy\u2019s Ice Bear\u00ae, and Axiom\u2019s Refrigeration BatteryTM battling it out in the\narena of building-sized ice makers.\n\n> IceBank is an air-conditioning solution that makes ice at night [when energy\n> demand is low] to cool buildings during the day. (source)\n\nAll this may make energy storage seem like a competitive space. But the\nreality is that these companies aren\u2019t competing with each other so much as\nthey are competing with peaker plants and cheap fossil fuels. An energy\nstorage startup can be in the strange position of continually adjusting their\nproduct and strategy in response to fluctuations in fossil fuel prices.\n\nBut as in the case of energy production, there should be a tipping point if\nstoring and reclaiming renewable energy can be made decisively cheaper than\ngenerating it from natural gas, and can be scaled up to meet demand.\n\nThe core technologies in energy storage tend to be physics-based, but software\nplays essential roles in the form of design tools, simulation tools, and\ncontrol systems. My favorite example is the inexplicably gorgeous Materials\nProject, a database and visualization tool for material properties, funded by\nthe Department of Energy\u2019s Vehicle Technologies Program to help invent better\nbatteries.\n\nFunding Public investment Private investment\n\nProducing Energy The stuff around the thing Computation\n\nMoving Energy Networking (moving in space) Storage (moving in time)\n\nConsuming Energy Transportation (consuming what?)

The most conspicuous\nsource of carbon emissions is the thick green bar from \u201cpetroleum\u201d to\n\u201ctransportation\u201d. We need to erase that.\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, we also ought to erase the thick grey bar from\n\u201ctransportation\u201d to \u201cwasted\u201d.\n\n(source)\n\nPassenger vehicles account for the majority of transportation-related\ngreenhouse gas emissions. There are a number of emerging ways to reduce this\nimpact.\n\nElectric vehicles are inevitable. Today, powering a car from the grid might\nnot be much cleaner than burning gasoline. But once the grid cleans up, not\nonly will electric cars be cleaner than gas cars, they may be more efficient\nthan mass transit.\n\nNew kinds of powered vehicles are becoming possible which are more nimble and\nefficient than cars.\n\nMost trips people take are fairly short. It\u2019s not inconceivable that new\nvehicles could replace cars for most trips if the technology, design, and\nmarketing are right, and the proper infrastructure and laws are in place. And\nyou don\u2019t need to start a car company to work on them.\n\nCoordinated autonomous vehicles could lead to very different ways of moving\naround people and deliveries. This is basically mobile robotics on a big\nscale. And again, you don\u2019t necessarily need to go work for a car company in\norder to make interesting things here.\n\nReducing the need for personal transportation via urban design. Among other\nreasons, this is important to counter the likely tendency of autonomous cars\nto increase urban sprawl, which has been strongly correlated with emissions.\n\nSimilar opportunities apply to fleet vehicles. One of the cofounders of Tesla\nis now in the business of electrifying Fedex vans and garbage trucks. Long-\nhaul trucks are more of a challenge, but there\u2019s room for improvement in\nfuels, vehicle design, and logistics.\n\nAs for airplanes, people might just have to fly less. This will require better\ntools for remote collaboration, or in Saul Griffith\u2019s words, \u201cMake video\nconferencing not suck.\u201d\n\n### Coordination (consuming when?)\n\nMany home appliances that consume significant electricity \u2014 air conditioner,\nwater heater, clothes dryer, electric vehicle charger \u2014 have some tolerance in\nwhen they actually need to run. You don\u2019t care exactly when your electric car\nis charging as long as it\u2019s charged in the morning, and you don\u2019t care exactly\nwhen your water heater is heating, as long as the tank stays hot.\n\nIf your water heater could talk to your neighbor\u2019s water heater and agree to\navoid heating water at the same time, it would flatten out the demand curve,\nand help avoid the ups and downs that must be serviced by peaker plants. The\nwater heater could also work aggressively when solar power was plentiful and\nhold back when clouds went by, to match the intermittency of renewables and\nrequire less energy storage.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Institute calls this \u201cdemand flexibility\u201d, and imagines\nappliances coordinated through price signals.\n\n> Demand flexibility uses communication and control technology to shift\n> electricity use across hours of the day while delivering end-use services at\n> the same or better quality but lower cost. It does this by applying\n> automatic control to reshape a customer\u2019s demand profile continuously in\n> ways that either are invisible to or minimally affect the customer. (source)\n\nThis sort of coordination is a goal of many of the \u201csmart grid\u201d proposals.\n\nexample of load-shifting in response to price (usage in kW) (source)\n\n### Efficiency (consuming how much?)\n\nper capita electricity use in MWh (source)\n\nIn the 1970s, efficiency pioneer Art Rosenfeld instigated an unprecedented\nprogram of energy saving, literally halting the growth of per-capita\nelectricity consumption in California.\n\nenergy savings in California in TWh (source)\n\nA lot of important technology came out of his lab, such as the ballasts that\nmade compact florescent lamps viable, but his two biggest influences were\nregulatory. Half the energy savings in California came from adjusting the\nprofit structure of power utilities so they could be profitable selling less\npower.\n\nenergy consumption of new U.S. refrigerators in MWh/yr (source)\n\nThe other half came from mandating energy usage standards for buildings and\nappliances. These standards, as well as more recent voluntary programs such as\nEnergy Star, forced companies to compete on efficiency. This drove innovation\n(and even reduced cost!) far more than simple consumer preference.\n\nBuilding standards are a particularly interesting case here, because they\nwere, and are, intimately tied to software.\n\n> (Art Rosenfeld) [In 1975] the CEC\u2019s draft \u201cTitle 24\u201d residential building\n> standard proposed to limit window area to 15% of wall area, without\n> distinguishing among north, south, east, and west.

(source)\n\nRosenfeld\u2019s energy-modeling software (which became DOE-2, then EnergyPlus) was\nquickly and widely adopted for calculating and specifying building performance\nstandards.\n\nNot only does energy simulation software still drive building standards,\nenergy analysis tools such as Green Building Studio and OpenStudio are now an\nintegral part of the building design process. Particularly interesting are\ntools such as Sefaira and Flux, which give the designer immediate feedback on\nenergy performance as they adjust building parameters in realtime.\n\nSefaira\n\nFlux\n\nIf efficiency incentives and tools have been effective for utilities,\nmanufacturers, and designers, what about for end users? One concern I\u2019ve\nalways had is that most people have no idea where their energy goes, so any\nattempt to conserve is like optimizing a program without a profiler.\n\nEfficiency through analytics has motivated a lot of projects, from the humble\nand niche Kill-A-Watt,\n\nto the characteristically short-lived Google PowerMeter and Microsoft Hohm\nservices.\n\nThere are online energy calculators, such as Berkeley Lab\u2019s Home Energy Saver,\n\nand energy dashboards are appearing in commercial and institutional buildings.\n\nMany of these projects are unsuccessful and possibly only marginally\neffective. I don\u2019t think this means that efficiency feedback will always be\nunsuccessful \u2014 just that it needs to be done well, it needs to be actionable,\nand most importantly, it needs to be targeted at people with the motivation\nand leverage to take significant action.\n\nIndividual consumers and homeowners might not be the best targets. A more\npromising audience is people who manage large-scale systems and services.\n\nFor example, garbage collection. Garbage trucks stop-and-go down every street,\nin every city, at 3 miles per gallon. The startup Enevo makes sensors which\ntrash collectors install in dumpsters, and provides logistics software that\nplans an optimal collection route each day. By only picking up full bins, they\ncut fuel consumption in half.\n\nEnevo works at the system level, not consumer level. There are fewer customers\nat system-level, but those customers have the motivation and leverage to\nimplement heavy efficiency improvements.\n\nFunding Public investment Private investment\n\nProducing Energy The stuff around the thing Computation\n\nMoving Energy Networking (moving in space) Storage (moving in time)\n\nConsuming Energy Transportation (consuming what?)

Their\ninfluence is indirect; they get taken for granted. But I feel that technical\ntools are of overwhelming importance, and completely under the radar of most\npeople working to address climate change.\n\n### Languages for technical computing\n\nI was hanging out with climate scientists while working on Al Gore\u2019s book, and\nthey mostly did their thing in R. This is typical; most statistical research\nis done in R. The language seems to inspire a level of vitriol that\u2019s\nimpressive even by programmers\u2019 standards. Even R\u2019s advocates always seem sort\nof apologetic.\n\n> Using R is a bit akin to smoking. The beginning is difficult, one may get\n> headaches and even gag the first few times. But in the long run, it becomes\n> pleasurable and even addictive. Yet, deep down, for those willing to be\n> honest, there is something not fully healthy in it. (source)\n\nComplementary to R is Matlab, the primary language for numerical computing in\nmany scientific and engineering fields. It\u2019s ubiquitous. Matlab has been\ndescribed as \u201cthe PHP of scientific computing\u201d.\n\n> MATLAB is not good. Do not use it. (source)\n\nR and Matlab are both forty years old, weighed down with forty years of cruft\nand bad design decisions. Scientists and engineers use them because they are\nthe vernacular, and there are no better alternatives.\n\nHere\u2019s an opinion you might not hear much \u2014 I feel that one effective approach\nto addressing climate change is contributing to the development of Julia.\nJulia is a modern technical language, intended to replace Matlab, R, SciPy,\nand C++ on the scientific workbench. It\u2019s immature right now, but it has\nbeautiful foundations, enthusiastic users, and a lot of potential.\n\nI say this despite the fact that my own work has been in much the opposite\ndirection as Julia. Julia inherits the textual interaction of classic Matlab,\nSciPy, and other children of the teletype \u2014 source code and command lines.\n\nThe goal of my own research has been tools where scientists see what they\u2019re\ndoing in realtime, with immediate visual feedback and interactive exploration.\nI deeply believe that a sea change in invention and discovery is possible,\nonce technologists are working in environments designed around:\n\nInteractive Exploration of a Dynamical System\n\nubiquitous visualization and in-context manipulation of the system being\nstudied;\n\nUp and Down the Ladder of Abstraction\n\nactively exploring system behavior across multiple levels of abstraction in\nparallel;\n\nMultitrack Signal Processing\n\nvisually investigating system behavior by transforming, measuring, searching,\nabstracting;\n\nInventing on Principle\n\nseeing the values of all system variables, all at once, in context;\n\nMedia for Thinking the Unthinkable\n\ndynamic notations that embed simulation, and show the effects of parameter\nchanges;\n\nDrawing Dynamic Visualizations\n\nvisually improvising special-purpose dynamic visualizations as needed.\n\nObviously I think this approach is important, and I urge you to pursue it if\nit speaks to you.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019m also happy to endorse Julia because, well, it\u2019s just\nabout the only example of well-grounded academic research in technical\ncomputing. It\u2019s the craziest thing. I\u2019ve been following the programming\nlanguage community for a decade, I\u2019ve spoken at SPLASH and POPL and Strange\nLoop, and it\u2019s only slightly an unfair generalization to say that almost every\nprogramming language researcher is working on\n\n(a) languages and methods for software developers, (b) languages for novices\nor end-users, (c) implementation of compilers or runtimes, or (d) theoretical\nconsiderations, often of type systems.\n\nThe very concept of a \u201cprogramming language\u201d originated with languages for\nscientists \u2014 now such languages aren\u2019t even part of the discussion! Yet they\nremain the tools by which humanity understands the world and builds a better\none.\n\nIf we can provide our climate scientists and energy engineers with a civilized\ncomputing environment, I believe it will make a very significant difference.\nBut not one that is easily visible or measured!\n\n(a) sampling of \u201clanguages and methods for software developers\u201d at SPLASH 2015\n(source)\n\nRust: Idioms and Design Patterns Functional Reactive Programming with nothing\nbut Promises Proposal for an Object-Oriented Multiple Dispatch Mechanism\nLogical Reactive Programming Real-Time Deadlines in Functional-Reactive\nProgramming Beyond Bash: Shell scripting in a statically-typed, object-\noriented language\n\n(b) sampling of \u201clanguages for novices or end-users\u201d at SPLASH 2015 (source)\n\nThe Spreadsheet Paradigm: A Basis for Powerful and Accessible Programming\nModel, Execute, Deploy: Answering the Hard Questions about End-user\nProgramming Language-Oriented Business Applications: Helping End Users become\nProgrammers ActiveSheets: Stream Processing with a Spreadsheet The Gamma:\nProgramming tools for data journalism An end-user programming environment\nthat\u2019s cell-based and copy/paste friendly\n\n(c) sampling of \u201cimplementation of compilers or runtimes\u201d at SPLASH 2015\n(source)\n\nAkka.js: Towards a portable actor runtime environment CLOP: A multi-stage\ncompiler to seamlessly embed heterogeneous code Language Independent Storage\nStrategies for Tracing JIT based VMs Java-to-JavaScript Translation via\nStructured Control Flow Reconstruction of Compiler IR Runtime Pointer\nDisambiguation Optimizing Hash-Array Mapped Tries for Fast and Lean Immutable\nJVM Collections\n\n(d) sampling of \u201ctheoretical considerations\u201d at SPLASH 2015 (source)\n\nA Formal Foundation for Trace-Based JIT Compilers A Formalization of Typed Lua\nGradual Certified Programming in Coq Relational Algebra by way of Adjunctions\nA Co-Contextual Formulation of Type Rules and its Application to Incremental\nType Checking Actario: A Framework for Reasoning About Actor Systems\n\n### Languages for modeling physical systems\n\nA climate model is software, but it\u2019s a different kind of software than what\nmost developers normally think about. Software development usually means\ndeveloping software systems \u2014 code that does useful work \u201cas itself\u201d, such as\napps and servers and games. The purpose of a climate model, on the other hand,\nis to \u201cbe something else\u201d \u2014 to simulate a physical system in the world.\n\nA circuit model or mechanical model, these days, is essentially software as\nwell. But again, such a model is not intended to serve as a working software\nsystem, but to aid in the design of a working physical system.\n\nHere are a handful of languages intended for modeling, simulating, or\ndesigning physical systems:\n\nMathematica \u2014 symbolic manipulation and solving\n\nSimulink \u2014 continuous-time dynamic systems\n\nModelica \u2014 mechanical, electrical, etc systems\n\nVerilog-AMS \u2014 analog and mixed-signal electronics\n\nEsterel \u2014 reactive control systems\n\nSBOL \u2014 synthetic biology systems\n\nLanguages like these don\u2019t get mentioned at programming language research\nconferences, or in discussions. They\u2019re typically dismissed as \u201cdomain-\nspecific\u201d. This pejorative reflects a peculiar geocentrism of the programming\nlanguage community, whose \u201cgeneral-purpose languages\u201d such as Java and Python\nare in fact very much domain-specific \u2014 specific to the domain of software\ndevelopment.\n\nModelica is a programming language, but it is not a language for software\ndevelopment! It\u2019s for developing physical things that affect the physical\nworld \u2014 such as the machinery that participates in energy production, energy\nstorage, and energy consumption. Data flow in Modelica works like no general-\npurpose language in existence, because it\u2019s designed around how things\ninfluence things in physics, not on a CPU.\n\nI\u2019ve seen enormous effort expended on languages, tools, and frameworks for\nsoftware developers. If you believe that language design can significantly\naffect the quality of software systems, then it should follow that language\ndesign can also affect the quality of energy systems. And if the quality of\nsuch energy systems will, in turn, affect the livability of our planet, then\nit\u2019s critical that the language development community give modeling languages\nthe attention they deserve.\n\n### Languages for controlling physical systems\n\nAn embedded control system is software, but again, it\u2019s a different kind of\nsoftware. Conventional software development is about building systems that\nlive in a virtual world of pixels, files, databases, networks. The embedded\ncontroller is part of a physical system, sensing and actuating the physical\nworld.\n\nEvery modern piece of equipment producing or consuming energy \u2014 every wind\nturbine, battery system, or vehicle \u2014 is built around one or more of these\ncontrol systems.\n\nI started my career designing embedded systems. Standard practice is: you\ndesign and perhaps simulate your system in Matlab or Simulink or pencil. You\nimplement it in C. Sometimes C++, sometimes assembly, very occasionally\nsomeone will sneak some Forth or Lua in there. But the idea that you might\nimplement a control system in an environment designed for designing control\nsystems \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been part of the thinking. This leads to long feedback\nloops, inflexible designs, and guesswork engineering. But most critically, it\ndenies engineers the sort of exploratory environment that fosters novel ideas.\n\nThere exist methodologies with the right intentions \u2014 model-based design with\ngenerated code seems to be coming into use here and there on industrial\nprojects, for example. But not only are such methods deeply segregated from\nthe mainstream tech community, they are almost antithetical to how today\u2019s\nprogrammers are trained to think.\n\n> Lessons Learned [from Caterpillar\u2019s pilot project]: Developers who have\n> primarily a control system design background adopt the model-based approach\n> with enthusiasm. Developers with primarily Computer Science backgrounds are\n> uncomfortable with model-based development and require significantly more\n> time and information prior to adopting the methodology. (source)\n\nThe success of Arduino has had the perhaps retrograde effect of convincing an\nentire generation that the way to sense and actuate the physical world is\nthrough imperative method calls in C++, shuffling bits and writing to ports,\ninstead of in an environment designed around signal processing, control\ntheory, and rapid and visible exploration. As a result, software engineers\nfind a fluid, responsive programming experience on the screen, and a crude and\nclumsy programming experience in the world. It\u2019s easier to conjure up virtual\nfireworks than to blink an LED. So more and more of our engineers have\nretreated into the screen.\n\nBut climate change happens in the physical world. The technology to address it\nmust operate on the physical world. We won\u2019t get that technology without good\ntools for programming beyond the screen.\n\n### Tools for problem-finding\n\nThe tools discussed so far are for scientists and engineers working on a\nproblem. But let\u2019s back up. How can someone find the right problem to work on\nin the first place? And how can they evaluate whether they have the right\nideas to solve it?\n\n#### Tools for discovering problems\n\nEveryone knows the high-level areas that need work: \u201cclean energy\u201d, \u201ccarbon\ncapture\u201d, and so on. But real engineering problems lie in the details \u2014 how to\nquickly estimate wind capacity at a location; how to place windmills without\naerodynamic interference; how to store energy in compressed air without losing\nit through heat.\n\nHow do we surface these problems? How can an eager technologist find their way\nto sub-problems within other people\u2019s projects where they might have a\nrelevant idea? How can they be exposed to process problems common across many\nprojects?\n\nI know a clean-energy inventor who will browse around a treemap of global\nexports, as a crude way to get a feel for the \u201cspace of industry\u201d. She\u2019ll see,\nfor example, \u201cgas turbines\u201d, and get interested in ideas for improved gas\nturbines. But then what? Where does she go from there?\n\nShe wishes she could simply click on \u201cgas turbines\u201d, and explore the space:\n\nWhat are open problems in the field? Who\u2019s working on which projects? What are\nthe fringe ideas? What are the process bottlenecks? What dominates cost? What\nlimits adoption? Why make improvements here? How would the world benefit?\n\nNone of this information is at her fingertips. Most isn\u2019t even openly\navailable \u2014 companies boast about successes, not roadblocks. For each topic,\nshe would have to spend weeks tracking down and meeting with industry\ninsiders. What she\u2019d like is a tool that lets her skim across entire fields,\nbrowsing problems and discovering where she could be most useful.\n\nThere are many reasons, of course, why organizations tend not to publicize\ntheir problems. But in a planetary crisis, the \u201csecretive competitive company\u201d\nmight not be the ideal organizing structure for human effort. In an admirable\ngesture of global goodwill, Tesla recently \u201copen-sourced\u201d their patents, but\npatents represent solutions. What if there were some way Tesla could reveal\ntheir open problems?\n\nexports from anywhere to anywhere, Observatory of Economic Complexity (source)\n\n#### Tools for evaluating ideas\n\nSuppose my friend uncovers an interesting problem in gas turbines, and comes\nup with an idea for an improvement. Now what?\n\nIs the improvement significant? Is the solution technically feasible? How much\nwould the solution cost to produce? How much would it need to cost to be\nviable? Who would use it? What are their needs? What metrics are even\nrelevant?\n\nAgain, none of this information is at her fingertips, or even accessible.\nShe\u2019d have to spend weeks doing an analysis, tracking down relevant data,\ngetting price quotes, talking to industry insiders.*\n\nWhat she\u2019d like are tools for quickly estimating the answers to these\nquestions, so she can fluidly explore the space of possibilities and identify\nideas that have some hope of being important, feasible, and viable.\n\n* And that\u2019s assuming she can even find the right people to talk to! For some valuable inventions, such as thermal energy storage for supermarkets and electric powertrains for garbage trucks, one wonders how the inventors stumbled upon such a niche application in the first place.\n\nIn the case of garbage trucks, the answer is that the technology was developed\nfor a different purpose, and the customer had to figure it out themselves:\n\n> FedEx was the first customer, and we did the medium-duty trucks first. Once\n> we got some publicity with that, I got a call from one of the local garbage\n> service providers... \u201cThis looks like it would work great for delivery\n> trucks, [but] can you scale that up to my Class 8 garbage trucks? Will that\n> work?\u201d We said, we hadn\u2019t thought of that, but let\u2019s go do the engineering\n> and see if it will. In fact, it does, and it works really well.

We can reduce pollution by pulling some of these wrecks off\n> the road. Several pilot programs have found that doing so is a cost-\n> effective way to reduce emissions. (source)\n\nHis article inspired the Car Allowance Rebate System, a $3 billion federal\nprogram which ran in July 2009. Car owners were offered a $3500 rebate for\ntrading in an inefficient vehicle when purchasing a more efficient one. There\nwas enormous debate, before and after, about what the parameters of the\nprogram should be, and whether it would be effective. Proponents claimed:\n\n> \u201cCash for clunkers\u201d is a common-sense proposal that will... reduce the\n> emissions that cause climate change, and make America more energy\n> independent. By helping Americans trade in their old, less fuel efficient\n> cars and trucks for newer, higher mileage vehicles, consumers will save\n> money at the pump, help protect our planet, and create and save jobs for\n> American auto workers. (source)\n\nwhile critics claimed:\n\n> Although the program was originally billed as a way to reduce greenhouse\n> gases, it achieves this aim amid huge expense and massive inefficiencies.\n> Cash for Clunkers may diminish our nation\u2019s overall carbon footprint, but\n> the associated costs will be at least 10 times higher than other carbon-\n> reduction strategies. (source)\n\nWho to believe?\n\nThe real question is \u2014 why are readers and decision-makers forced to \u201cbelieve\u201d\nanything at all? Many claims made during the debate offered no numbers to back\nthem up. Claims with numbers rarely provided context to interpret those\nnumbers. And never were readers shown the calculations behind any numbers.\nReaders had to make up their minds on the basis of hand-waving, rhetoric,\nbombast.\n\nImagine if Blinder\u2019s proposal in the New York Times were written like this:\n\n> Say we allocate $3.0 billion for the following program: Car-owners who trade\n> in an old car that gets less than 17 MPG, and purchase a new car that gets\n> better than 24 MPG, will receive a $3,500 rebate.\n>\n> We estimate that this will get 828,571 old cars off the road. It will save\n> 1,068 million gallons of gas (or 68 hours worth of U.S. gas consumption.) It\n> will avoid 9.97 million tons CO_2e, or 0.14% of annual U.S. greenhouse gas\n> emissions.\n>\n> The abatement cost is $301 per ton CO_2e of federal spending, although it\u2019s\n> -$20 per ton CO_2e on balance if you account for the money saved by\n> consumers buying less gas.\n\nThis passage gives some estimates of what the proposal would actually do. But\nthere\u2019s something more going on. Some numbers above are in green. Drag green\nnumbers with your mouse to adjust them. (Really, do it!) Notice how the\nconsequences of your adjustments are reflected immediately in the following\nparagraph. The reader can explore alternative scenarios, understand the\ntradeoffs involved, and come to an informed conclusion about whether any such\nproposal could be a good decision.\n\nThis is possible because the author is not just publishing words. The author\nhas provided a model \u2014 a set of formulas and algorithms that calculate the\nconsequences of a given scenario. Some numbers above are in blue. Click a blue\nnumber to reveal how it was calculated. (\u201cIt will save 1,068 million gallons\u201d\nis a particularly meaty calculation.) Notice how the model\u2019s assumptions are\nclearly visible, and can even be adjusted by the reader.\n\nReaders are thus encouraged to examine and critique the model. If they\ndisagree, they can modify it into a competing model with their own preferred\nassumptions, and use it to argue for their position. Model-driven material can\nbe used as grounds for an informed debate about assumptions and tradeoffs.\n\nModeling leads naturally from the particular to the general. Instead of seeing\nan individual proposal as \u201cright or wrong\u201d, \u201cbad or good\u201d, people can see it\nas one point in a large space of possibilities. By exploring the model, they\ncome to understand the landscape of that space, and are in a position to\ninvent better ideas for all the proposals to come.

Discussion and debate will be central to\nfiguring out the best actions to take. We need good tools for imagining,\nproposing, debating, and understanding these actions.\n\nThe importance of models may need to be underscored in this age of \u201cbig data\u201d\nand \u201cdata mining\u201d. Data, no matter how big, can only tell you what happened in\nthe past. Unless you\u2019re a historian, you actually care about the future \u2014 what\nwill happen, what could happen, what would happen if you did this or that.\nExploring these questions will always require models. Let\u2019s get over \u201cbig\ndata\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s time for \u201cbig modeling\u201d.\n\n### Model-driven reading\n\nHow do we get public perception and public discussion of energy and climate\ncentered around evidence-grounded models, instead of tips, soundbites,\nfactoids, and emotional rhetoric?\n\nOr \u2014 are you really saving the earth by turning off your lights at night? By\nhow much? How do you know?\n\nThis is something I struggled with in Ten Brighter Ideas and Explorable\nExplanations, among other projects.\n\n> (Ten Brighter Ideas) As with many areas of public interest, the common\n> wisdom surrounding energy conservation consists of myths and legends, rules\n> of thumb and superstitions. We\u2019re given guidelines as soundbites, catchy but\n> insubstantial. We trust them blindly, not knowing whether our actions make\n> any significant impact...\n>\n> As you explore this document, imagine a world where we expect every claim to\n> be accompanied by an explorable analysis, and every statistic to be linked\n> to a primary source. Imagine collecting data and designing analyses in a\n> collaborative wiki-like manner. (source)\n\nImagine a concerned citizen who does a web search for \"what can I do about\nclimate change\". The top two results as I write this are the EPA\u2019s What You\nCan Do and the David Suzuki Foundation\u2019s Top 10 ways you can stop climate\nchange.\n\nThese are lists of proverbs. Little action items, mostly dequantified,\nentirely decontextualized. How significant is it to \u201ceat wisely\u201d and \u201ctrim\nyour waste\u201d? How does it compare to other sources of harm? How does it fit\ninto the big picture? How many people would have to participate in order for\nthere to be appreciable impact? How do you know that these aren\u2019t token\nactions to assauge guilt?\n\nAnd why trust them? Their rhetoric is catchy, but so is the horrific\n\u201cdenialist\u201d rhetoric from the Cato Institute and similar. When the discussion\nis at the level of \u201ctrust me, I\u2019m a scientist\u201d and \u201clook at the poor polar\nbears\u201d, it becomes a matter of emotional appeal and faith, a form of religion.\n\nlook at this polar bear\n\nlook at this science\n\nClimate change is too important for us to operate on faith. Citizens need and\ndeserve reading material which shows context \u2014 how significant suggested\nactions are in the big picture \u2014 and which embeds models \u2014 formulas and\nalgorithms which calculate that significance, for different scenarios, from\nprimary-source data and explicit assumptions.\n\n### Model-driven authoring\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t such material exist? Why isn\u2019t every paragraph in the New York\nTimes written like this?\n\nOne reason is that the resources for creating this material don\u2019t exist. In\norder for model-driven material to become the norm, authors will need data,\nmodels, tools, and standards.\n\n#### Data\n\nTen Brighter Ideas is embarrassingly incomplete. I had to give up after three\nanalyses because it was too painful to find the data I needed. I was spending\ndays desperately typing words into search engines, crawling around government\nwebsites, and scrolling through PDFs. (This was before data.gov, which I\u2019ve\nsince found to be more disappointing than useful.)\n\nI assumed the pros had some better process, but later on Our Choice, I found\nmyself watching Al Gore\u2019s research team and climate scientist friends as they\ntyped words into search engines, crawled around government websites, and\nscrolled through PDFs.*\n\nmy eyes are bleeding\n\n* Although sometimes they could type words into password-protected search engines to scroll through PDFs that weren\u2019t freely available, despite being products of scholarly research performed with public funds. I don\u2019t have to talk here about the desperate need for open-access scientific publication, right? That\u2019s well-trod ground?\n\n#### Models\n\nIf data is hard to find, models are virtually impossible.\n\nWhat\u2019s a formula for estimating the power consumption of a home\u2019s lighting?\n\nWhat\u2019s an algorithm that models the activity pattern of a water heater? Or a\nthermostat?\n\nWhat\u2019s an equation for how methane emissions would vary with meat consumption?\n\nIf a given country were to reduce deforestation by a given amount, how would\nthat affect how much carbon it sinks?\n\nHow do you quantify \u201ceating wisely\u201d and \u201ctrimming your waste\u201d? And how do you\ncalculate the effects as those quantities change?\n\nPeople have figured out these things! The formulas exist in Excel spreadsheets\nand Matlab code, buried on old hard drives somewhere. Sometimes they\u2019re\nvaguely described in prose in published papers. But they aren\u2019t accessible \u2014\nthey\u2019re difficult to find, and generally impossible to \u201cgrab and use\u201d. The\nrare author will be able to make up their own models; most authors have no\nchoice but to trust and regurgitate soundbites.\n\nWhat if there were an \u201cnpm\u201d for scientific models?\n\nwhat if you could \u201cnpm install residential-lighting-energy-model\u201d\n\nvar lighting = require(\u2019residential-lighting-energy-model\u2019);\n\nvar energyPerYear = lighting.getEnergyPerYear({ zipCode: 94110, houseSize:\n\"small\", occupants: 3, fluorescentFraction: 0.75, });\n\n// energyPerYear should actually be a probability distribution, // not a\nnumber, but that\u2019s an essay for another time\n\n#### Tools\n\nSuppose there were good access to good data and good models. How would an\nauthor write a document incorporating them?\n\nToday, even the most modern writing tools are designed around typing in words,\nnot facts. These tools are suitable for promoting preconceived ideas, but\nprovide no help in ensuring that words reflect reality, or any plausible model\nof reality. They encourage authors to fool themselves, and fool others.\n\n> (Richard Feynman) The first principle is that you must not fool yourself \u2014\n> and you are the easiest person to fool. (source)\n\nImagine an authoring tool designed for arguing from evidence. I don\u2019t mean\nmerely juxtaposing a document and reference material, but literally\n\u201cautocompleting\u201d sourced facts directly into the document. Perhaps the tool\nwould have built-in connections to fact databases and model repositories, not\nunlike the built-in spelling dictionary. What if it were as easy to insert\nfacts, data, and models as it is to insert emoji and cat photos?\n\nplay again\n\nFurthermore, the point of embedding a model is that the reader can explore\nscenarios within the context of the document. This requires tools for\nauthoring \u201cdynamic documents\u201d \u2014 documents whose contents change as the reader\nexplores the model. Such tools are pretty much non-existent.\n\nThe examples above use Tangle, a little library I made as a bootstrapping\nstep. It\u2019s far from the goal of a real dynamic authoring tool. What might such\na tool look like? Some sort of fusion of word processor and spreadsheet? An\nInform-like environment for composing dynamic text?\n\nwhat is the \u201cMicrosoft Word\u201d for something like this?\n\n#### Literacy and standards\n\nThe initial proposals I sketched for Our Choice were interactive graphics with\nscenario models, where readers could adjust parameters (e.g. pollution rate)\nand see the estimated effects. The book editors rejected these, immediately.\n\nThe reason was that every number in the text required a citation. This was\nespecially a concern for Al Gore, whose readership includes an aggressive\ncontingent meticulously seeking proof of his deceptive fabrications. For the\nbook\u2019s integrity, every number in the book must have appeared previously in a\nscientific paper. An interactive graphic which generated its own numbers from\nan algorithm was unpublishable \u2014 even if it used the same algorithm that the\nscientists themselves used.\n\nA commitment to sourcing every fact is laudable, of course. What\u2019s missing is\nan understanding of citing and publishing models, not just the data derived\nfrom those models. This is a new problem \u2014 older media couldn\u2019t generate data\non their own. Authors will need to figure out journalistic standards around\nmodel citation, and readers will need to become literate in how to \u201cread\u201d a\nmodel and understand its limitations.\n\nFunding Public investment Private investment\n\nProducing Energy The stuff around the thing Computation\n\nMoving Energy Networking (moving in space) Storage (moving in time)\n\nConsuming Energy Transportation (consuming what?) Coordination (consuming\nwhen?) Efficiency (consuming how much?)\n\nTools for Scientists & Engineers Technical computing Tools for modeling\nphysical systems Tools for controlling physical systems Tools for problem-\nfinding\n\nMedia for Understanding Situations Model-driven debate Model-driven reading\nModel-driven authoring\n\nAlso this Other technology Morale The world is not what you see\n\n## Also This\n\n### Other technology\n\n#### Nuclear power\n\nI didn\u2019t mention nuclear because I don\u2019t know much about it. See Stewart\nBrand\u2019s book Whole Earth Discipline for an optimistic take from a recent\nconvert.\n\n#### Geoengineering\n\n\u201cGeoengineering\u201d refers to \u201cthe deliberate large-scale intervention in the\nearth\u2019s natural systems to counteract climate change\u201d. The topic was taboo for\nmany years, and it remains \u201ccontroversial\u201d (a euphemism for \u201csocially risky to\nadvocate\u201d). As a result, the amount of research into geoengineering is almost\nnegligible compared to R&D on decarbonization.\n\nThis is unfortunate, because if total global decarbonization by 2050 doesn\u2019t\nsucceed, we\u2019ll be desperately wishing for some well-developed backup plans.\nAnd even if, by some miracle, it does, we\u2019ll still have 450-500 ppm of carbon\nin the atmosphere, not going anywhere, still wreaking havoc.\n\nGeoengineering is dicey because earth systems are complex and poorly\nunderstood, and interventions have unforseen consequences. To me, this is a\nclear and urgent call for much better tools for understanding complex systems\nand forseeing consequences.\n\nThere is almost certainly some set of things we can do at planet-scale that\nwould be effective and safe. It is almost certainly the case that the best\noptions are ideas that no one has thought of yet. Who will make the tools to\nenable people to conceive and verify these ideas?\n\natmospheric CO_2 concentration in ppmv (source)\n\nFears of geoengineering play into the narrative of a people done in by their\nhubris. But we\u2019re past that point; we had the hubris and it did us in. Human\nbeings now dominate the planet, and it\u2019s folly to pretend that merely\n\u201cminimizing our impact\u201d will reverse the damage.\n\nIn 1968, Stewart Brand began the Whole Earth Catalog with the quip, \u201cWe are as\ngods, and might as well get good at it.\u201d In 2009, his Whole Earth Discipline\nupped the urgency: \u201cWe are as gods, and have to get good at it.\u201d\n\nIf we must be gods, we should at least be cautious and well-informed gods,\nwith the best possible tools for seeing, understanding, and debating our\ninterventions, and the best possible meta-tools for improving those tools.\n\nportion of land-dwelling vertebrates that humans are responsible for, by mass\n(source)\n\n#### Foundational technology\n\nThe inventors of the integrated circuit were not thinking about how to\npreserve the environment. Neither were the founders of the internet. (Maybe\nexcept one.) Today, it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine addressing global\nproblems (or even reading this essay) without all the tools that have been\nbuilt upon this technology.\n\nfirst integrated circuit\n\nfirst internet\n\nFoundational technology appears essential only in retrospect. Looking forward,\nthese things have the character of \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d \u2014 they are rarely sought\nout (or funded!) as a solution to any specific problem. They appear out of the\nblue, initially seem niche, and eventually become relevant to everything.\n\nThey may be hard to predict, but they have some common characteristics. One is\nthat they scale well. Integrated circuits and the internet both scaled their\n\u201cbasic idea\u201d from a dozen elements to a billion. Another is that they are\npurpose-agnostic. They are \u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201cinfrastructure\u201d, not applications.\n\npercent of U.S. population using the internet (source)\n\nI have some candidates in mind; here\u2019s one I\u2019d put money on \u2014 Van Jacobson\u2019s\nnew internet protocol is a really big deal. I realize it sounds like overreach\nto claim that \u201cNamed Data Networking\u201d could be fundamental to addressing\nclimate change \u2014 that\u2019s my point \u2014 but my thought is, how could it not?\n\n### Morale\n\nClimate change, closely understood, is terrifying. The natural human response\nto such a bleak situation is despair.\n\nBut despair is not useful. Despair is paralysis, and there\u2019s work to be done.\n\nI feel that this is an essential psychological problem to be solved, and one\nthat I\u2019ve never seen mentioned: How do we create the conditions under which\nscientists and engineers can do great creative work without succumbing to\ndespair? And how can new people be encouraged to take up the problem, when\ntheir instinct is to turn away and work on something that lets them sleep at\nnight?\n\nCrisis can be motivating for some people in some circumstances \u2014 Rad Lab,\nManhattan Project, etc. \u2014 and there are clearly some people who draw\nmotivation from the climate crisis. But as George Marshall has explored in\ndepth, most people can\u2019t handle it, and need to put it out of their minds.\n\nThere are other fields of human endeavor in which morale must be managed quite\ndirectly, and they\u2019ve had millenia to develop techniques for \u201crallying the\ntroops\u201d or \u201cuplifting the congregation\u201d. I wonder if we can learn from them.\nFor both the climate worker and the soldier, the likelihood of imminent\nannihilation is a distraction, and they must be given a frame of mind that\nlets them concentrate on the work to be done.\n\n### The world is not what you see\n\nMikey Dickerson, an engineer who left Google to head up the heroic rescue of\nhealthcare.gov, concluded a recent talk with a plea to the tech crowd:\n\n> This is real life. This is your country... Our country is a place where we\n> allocate our resources through the collective decisions that all of us\n> make... We allocate our resources to the point where we have thousands of\n> engineers working on things like picture-sharing apps, when we\u2019ve already\n> got dozens of picture-sharing apps.\n>\n> We do not allocate anybody to problems like [identity theft of kids in\n> foster care, food stamp distribution, the immigration process, federal\n> pensions, the VA]... This is just a handful of things that I\u2019ve been asked\n> to staff in the last week or so and do not have adequate staff to do...\n>\n> These are all problems that need the attention of people like you. (source)\n\n100,000 people received an engineering bachelor\u2019s degree in the U.S. last\nyear. There are at least 100,000 people, every year, looking for an\nengineering problem to solve. I have my own plea to all such people \u2014\n\nThe inconveniences of daily life are not the significant problems. The world\nthat scrolls past you on Twitter is not the real world. You cannot calibrate\nyour sense of what\u2019s valuable and necessary to the current fashions in your\nfield.\n\nOne sometimes gets the feeling, as Ian Bogost put it, of rearranging app icons\non the Titanic. I think the tech community can do better than that. You can do\nbetter than that.\n\nClimate change is the problem of our time. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem, but it\u2019s\nour responsibility \u2014 as people with the incomparable leverage of being able to\nwork magic through technology.\n\nIn this essay, I\u2019ve tried to sketch out a map of where such magic is needed \u2014\nsystems for producing, moving, and consuming clean energy; tools for building\nthem; media for understanding what needs to be built. There are opportunities\neverywhere. Let\u2019s get to work.\n\n### Further reading\n\nthe plea\n\nBill Gates\n\nInnovating to Zero\n\nDanielle Fong\n\nA Time for Urgency\n\nthe situation\n\nEncyclopedia of Earth\n\nSaul Griffith\n\nClimate Change Recalculated\n\nenergy\n\nDavid MacKay\n\nWithout the Hot Air\n\nArt Rosenfeld\n\nThe Art of Energy Efficiency\n\ntechnology\n\nStewart Brand\n\nWhole Earth Discipline\n\nAl Gore\n\nOur Choice\n\nbusiness\n\nAmory Lovins\n\nReinventing Fire\n\nRamez Naam\n\nThe Infinite Resource\n\nDaniel Yergin\n\nThe Quest\n\npsychology\n\nGeorge Marshall\n\nDon\u2019t Even Think About It\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d No kidding.

It\u2019s meant as a jumping-off point.\nJump off it.\n\nThere\u2019s one overarching caveat. This essay employed the rhetoric of \u201cproblem-\nsolving\u201d throughout. I was trained as an engineer; engineers solve problems.\nBut, at least for the next century, the \u201cproblem\u201d of climate change will not\nbe \u201csolved\u201d \u2014 it can only be \u201cmanaged\u201d. This is a long game. One more reason\nto be thinking about tools, infrastructure, and foundations. The next\ngeneration has some hard work ahead of them.\n\nSo much thanks to Danielle Fong, Paula Te, Patrick Collison, Robert Ochshorn,\nand Joe Edelman for their help with this essay.
