Books still in print you\u2019d have to pay for, but\neverything else\u2014a collection slated to grow larger than the holdings at the\nLibrary of Congress, Harvard, the University of Michigan, at any of the great\nnational libraries of Europe\u2014would have been available for free at terminals\nthat were going to be placed in every local library that wanted one.\n\nAt the terminal you were going to be able to search tens of millions of books\nand read every page of any book you found. You\u2019d be able to highlight passages\nand make annotations and share them; for the first time, you\u2019d be able to\npinpoint an idea somewhere inside the vastness of the printed record, and send\nsomebody straight to it with a link. Books would become as instantly\navailable, searchable, copy-pasteable\u2014as alive in the digital world\u2014as web\npages.\n\nIt was to be the realization of a long-held dream. \u201cThe universal library has\nbeen talked about for millennia,\u201d Richard Ovenden, the head of Oxford\u2019s\nBodleian Libraries, has said. \u201cIt was possible to think in the Renaissance\nthat you might be able to amass the whole of published knowledge in a single\nroom or a single institution.\u201d In the spring of 2011, it seemed we\u2019d amassed\nit in a terminal small enough to fit on a desk.\n\n\u201cThis is a watershed event and can serve as a catalyst for the reinvention of\neducation, research, and intellectual life,\u201d one eager observer wrote at the\ntime.\n\nOn March 22 of that year, however, the legal agreement that would have\nunlocked a century\u2019s worth of books and peppered the country with access\nterminals to a universal library was rejected under Rule 23(e)(2) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure by the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York.\n\nWhen the library at Alexandria burned it was said to be an \u201cinternational\ncatastrophe.\u201d When the most significant humanities project of our time was\ndismantled in court, the scholars, archivists, and librarians who\u2019d had a hand\nin its undoing breathed a sigh of relief, for they believed, at the time, that\nthey had narrowly averted disaster.\n\n* * *\n\nGoogle\u2019s secret effort to scan every book in the world, codenamed \u201cProject\nOcean,\u201d began in earnest in 2002 when Larry Page and Marissa Mayer sat down in\nthe office together with a 300-page book and a metronome. Page wanted to know\nhow long it would take to scan more than a hundred-million books, so he\nstarted with one that was lying around. Using the metronome to keep a steady\npace, he and Mayer paged through the book cover-to-cover. It took them 40\nminutes.\n\nPage had always wanted to digitize books. Way back in 1996, the student\nproject that eventually became Google\u2014a \u201ccrawler\u201d that would ingest documents\nand rank them for relevance against a user\u2019s query\u2014was actually conceived as\npart of an effort \u201cto develop the enabling technologies for a single,\nintegrated and universal digital library.\u201d The idea was that in the future,\nonce all books were digitized, you\u2019d be able to map the citations among them,\nsee which books got cited the most, and use that data to give better search\nresults to library patrons. But books still lived mostly on paper. Page and\nhis research partner, Sergey Brin, developed their popularity-contest-by-\ncitation idea using pages from the World Wide Web.\n\nBy 2002, it seemed to Page like the time might be ripe to come back to books.\nWith that 40-minute number in mind, he approached the University of Michigan,\nhis alma mater and a world leader in book scanning, to find out what the state\nof the art in mass digitization looked like. Michigan told Page that at the\ncurrent pace, digitizing their entire collection\u20147 million volumes\u2014was going\nto take about a thousand years. Page, who\u2019d by now given the problem some\nthought, replied that he thought Google could do it in six.\n\nEvery weekday, semi trucks full of books would pull up at designated Google\nscanning centers.\n\nHe offered the library a deal: You let us borrow all your books, he said, and\nwe\u2019ll scan them for you. You\u2019ll end up with a digital copy of every volume in\nyour collection, and Google will end up with access to one of the great\nuntapped troves of data left in the world. Brin put Google\u2019s lust for library\nbooks this way: \u201cYou have thousands of years of human knowledge, and probably\nthe highest-quality knowledge is captured in books.\u201d What if you could feed\nall the knowledge that\u2019s locked up on paper to a search engine?\n\nBy 2004, Google had started scanning. In just over a decade, after making\ndeals with Michigan, Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, the New York Public Library,\nand dozens of other library systems, the company, outpacing Page\u2019s prediction,\nhad scanned about 25 million books. It cost them an estimated $400 million. It\nwas a feat not just of technology but of logistics.\n\nEvery weekday, semi trucks full of books would pull up at designated Google\nscanning centers. The one ingesting Stanford\u2019s library was on Google\u2019s\nMountain View campus, in a converted office building. The books were unloaded\nfrom the trucks onto the kind of carts you find in libraries and wheeled up to\nhuman operators sitting at one of a few dozen brightly lit scanning stations,\narranged in rows about six to eight feet apart.\n\nThe stations\u2014which didn\u2019t so much scan as photograph books\u2014had been custom-\nbuilt by Google from the sheet metal up. Each one could digitize books at a\nrate of 1,000 pages per hour. The book would lie in a specially designed\nmotorized cradle that would adjust to the spine, locking it in place. Above,\nthere was an array of lights and at least $1,000 worth of optics, including\nfour cameras, two pointed at each half of the book, and a range-finding LIDAR\nthat overlaid a three-dimensional laser grid on the book\u2019s surface to capture\nthe curvature of the paper. The human operator would turn pages by hand\u2014no\nmachine could be as quick and gentle\u2014and fire the cameras by pressing a foot\npedal, as though playing at a strange piano.\n\nWhat made the system so efficient is that it left so much of the work to\nsoftware. Rather than make sure that each page was aligned perfectly, and\nflattened, before taking a photo, which was a major source of delays in\ntraditional book-scanning systems, cruder images of curved pages were fed to\nde-warping algorithms, which used the LIDAR data along with some clever\nmathematics to artificially bend the text back into straight lines.\n\nAt its peak, the project involved about 50 full-time software engineers. They\ndeveloped optical character-recognition software for turning raw images into\ntext; they wrote de-warping and color-correction and contrast-adjustment\nroutines to make the images easier to process; they developed algorithms to\ndetect illustrations and diagrams in books, to extract page numbers, to turn\nfootnotes into real citations, and, per Brin and Page\u2019s early research, to\nrank books by relevance. \u201cBooks are not part of a network,\u201d Dan Clancy, who\nwas the engineering director on the project during its heyday, has said.\n\u201cThere is a huge research challenge, to understand the relationship between\nbooks.\u201d\n\nAt a time when the rest of Google was obsessed with making apps more\n\u201csocial\u201d\u2014Google Plus was released in 2011\u2014Books was seen by those who worked\non it as one of those projects from the old era, like Search itself, that made\ngood on the company\u2019s mission \u201cto organize the world\u2019s information and make it\nuniversally accessible and useful.\u201d\n\nIt was the first project that Google ever called a \u201cmoonshot.\u201d Before the\nself-driving car and Project Loon\u2014their effort to deliver Internet to Africa\nvia high-altitude balloons\u2014it was the idea of digitizing books that struck the\noutside world as a wide-eyed dream. Even some Googlers themselves thought of\nthe project as a boondoggle. \u201cThere were certainly lots of folks at Google\nthat while we were doing Google Book Search were like, Why are we spending all\nthis money on this project?,\u201d Clancy said to me. \u201cOnce Google started being a\nlittle more conscious about how it was spending money, it was like, wait, you\nhave $40 million a year, $50 million a year on the cost of scanning? It\u2019s\ngonna cost us $300 to $400 million before we\u2019re done? What are you thinking?\nBut Larry and Sergey were big supporters.\u201d\n\nIn August 2010, Google put out a blog post announcing that there were\n129,864,880 books in the world. The company said they were going to scan them\nall.\n\nOf course, it didn\u2019t quite turn out that way. This particular moonshot fell\nabout a hundred-million books short of the moon. What happened was complicated\nbut how it started was simple: Google did that thing where you ask for\nforgiveness rather than permission, and forgiveness was not forthcoming. Upon\nhearing that Google was taking millions of books out of libraries, scanning\nthem, and returning them as if nothing had happened, authors and publishers\nfiled suit against the company, alleging, as the authors put it simply in\ntheir initial complaint, \u201cmassive copyright infringement.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Google started scanning, they weren\u2019t actually setting out to build a\ndigital library where you could read books in their entirety; that idea would\ncome later. Their original goal was just to let you search books. For books in\ncopyright, all they would show you were \u201csnippets,\u201d just a few sentences of\ncontext around your search terms. They likened their service to a card\ncatalog.\n\nGoogle thought that creating a card catalog was protected by \u201cfair use,\u201d the\nsame doctrine of copyright law that lets a scholar excerpt someone\u2019s else\u2019s\nwork in order to talk about it. \u201cA key part of the line between what\u2019s fair\nuse and what\u2019s not is transformation,\u201d Google\u2019s lawyer, David Drummond, has\nsaid. \u201cYes, we\u2019re making a copy when we digitize. But surely the ability to\nfind something because a term appears in a book is not the same thing as\nreading the book. That\u2019s why Google Books is a different product from the book\nitself.\u201d\n\nIt was important for Drummond to be right. Statutory damages for \u201cwillful\ninfringement\u201d of a copyright can run as high as $150,000 for each work\ninfringed. Google\u2019s potential liability for copying tens of millions of books\ncould have run into the trillions of dollars. \u201cGoogle had some reason to fear\nthat it was betting the firm on its fair-use defense,\u201d Pamela Samuelson, a law\nprofessor at UC Berkeley, wrote in 2011. Copyright owners pounced.\n\nThey had good reason to. Instead of asking for anyone\u2019s permission, Google had\nplundered libraries. This seemed obviously wrong: If you wanted to copy a\nbook, you had to have the right to copy it\u2014you had to have the damn copyright.\nLetting Google get away with the wholesale copying of every book in America\nstruck them as setting a dangerous precedent, one that might well render their\ncopyrights worthless. An advocacy group called the Authors Guild, and several\nbook authors, filed a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of\neveryone with a U.S. copyright interest in a book. (A group of publishers\nfiled their own lawsuit but joined the Authors Guild class action shortly\nthereafter.)\n\nThere\u2019s actually a long tradition of technology companies disregarding\nintellectual-property rights as they invent new ways to distribute content. In\nthe early 1900s, makers of the \u201cpiano rolls\u201d that control player pianos\nignored copyrights in sheet music and were sued by music publishers. The same\nthing happened with makers of vinyl records and early purveyors of commercial\nradio. In the 60s, cable operators re-aired broadcast TV signals without first\ngetting permission and found themselves in costly litigation. Movie studios\nsued VCR makers. Music labels sued KazaA and Napster.\n\nAs Tim Wu pointed out in a 2003 law review article, what usually becomes of\nthese battles\u2014what happened with piano rolls, with records, with radio, and\nwith cable\u2014isn\u2019t that copyright holders squash the new technology. Instead,\nthey cut a deal and start making money from it. Often this takes the form of a\n\u201ccompulsory license\u201d in which, for example, musicians are required to license\ntheir work to the piano-roll maker, but in exchange, the piano-roll maker has\nto pay a fixed fee, say two cents per song, for every roll they produce.\nMusicians get a new stream of income, and the public gets to hear their\nfavorite songs on the player piano. \u201cHistory has shown that time and market\nforces often provide equilibrium in balancing interests,\u201d Wu writes.\n\nBut even if everyone typically ends up ahead, each new cycle starts with\nrightsholders fearful they\u2019re being displaced by the new technology. When the\nVCR came out, film executives lashed out. \u201cI say to you that the VCR is to the\nAmerican film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to\nthe woman home alone,\u201d Jack Valenti, then the president of the MPAA, testified\nbefore Congress. The major studios sued Sony, arguing that with the VCR, the\ncompany was trying to build an entire business on intellectual property theft.\nBut Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. became famous for\nits holding that as long as a copying device was capable of \u201csubstantial\nnoninfringing uses\u201d\u2014like someone watching home movies\u2014its makers couldn\u2019t be\nheld liable for copyright infringement.\n\n\u201cThere was an opportunity to do something extraordinary for readers and\nacademics in this country.\u201d\n\nThe Sony case forced the movie industry to accept the existence of VCRs. Not\nlong after, they began to see the device as an opportunity. \u201cThe VCR turned\nout to be one of the most lucrative inventions\u2014for movie producers as well as\nhardware manufacturers\u2014since movie projectors,\u201d one commentator put it in\n2000.\n\nIt only took a couple of years for the authors and publishers who sued Google\nto realize that there was enough middle ground to make everyone happy. This\nwas especially true when you focused on the back catalog, on out-of-print\nworks, instead of books still on store shelves. Once you made that\ndistinction, it was possible to see the whole project in a different light.\nMaybe Google wasn\u2019t plundering anyone\u2019s work. Maybe they were giving it a new\nlife. Google Books could turn out to be for out-of-print books what the VCR\nhad been for movies out of the theater.\n\nIf that was true, you wouldn\u2019t actually want to stop Google from scanning out-\nof-print books\u2014you\u2019d want to encourage it. In fact, you\u2019d want them to go\nbeyond just showing snippets to actually selling those books as digital\ndownloads. Out-of-print books, almost by definition, were commercial dead\nweight. If Google, through mass digitization, could make a new market for\nthem, that would be a real victory for authors and publishers. \u201cWe realized\nthere was an opportunity to do something extraordinary for readers and\nacademics in this country,\u201d Richard Sarnoff, who was then Chairman of the\nAmerican Association of Publishers, said at the time. \u201cWe realized that we\ncould light up the out-of-print backlist of this industry for two things:\ndiscovery and consumption.\u201d\n\nBut once you had that goal in mind, the lawsuit itself\u2014which was about whether\nGoogle could keep scanning and displaying snippets\u2014began to seem small time.\nSuppose the Authors Guild won: they were unlikely to recoup anything more than\nthe statutory minimum in damages; and what good would it do to stop Google\nfrom providing snippets of old books? If anything those snippets might drive\ndemand. And suppose Google won: Authors and publishers would get nothing, and\nall readers would get for out-of-print books would be snippets\u2014not access to\nfull texts.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in other words, had gotten themselves into a pretty unusual\nsituation. They didn\u2019t want to lose their own lawsuit\u2014but they didn\u2019t want to\nwin it either.\n\n* * *\n\nThe basic problem with out-of-print books is that it\u2019s unclear who owns most\nof them. An author might have signed a book deal with their publisher 40 years\nago; that contract stipulated that the rights revert to the author after the\nbook goes out of print, but required the author to send a notice to that\neffect, and probably didn\u2019t say anything about digital rights; and all this\nwas recorded on some pieces of paper that nobody has.\n\nIt\u2019s been estimated that about half the books published between 1923 and 1963\nare actually in the public domain\u2014it\u2019s just that no one knows which half.\nCopyrights back then had to be renewed, and often the rightsholder wouldn\u2019t\nbother filing the paperwork; if they did, the paperwork could be lost. The\ncost of figuring out who owns the rights to a given book can end up being\ngreater than the market value of the book itself. \u201cTo have people go and\nresearch each one of these titles,\u201d Sarnoff said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s not just\nSisyphean\u2014it\u2019s an impossible task economically.\u201d Most out-of-print books are\ntherefore locked up, if not by copyright then by inconvenience.\n\nThe tipping point toward a settlement of Authors Guild v. Google was the\nrealization that it offered a way to skirt this problem entirely. Authors\nGuild was a class action lawsuit, and the class included everyone who held an\nAmerican copyright in one or more books. In a class action, the named\nplaintiffs litigate on behalf of the whole class (though anyone who wants to\ncan opt out).\n\nSo a settlement of the Authors Guild case could theoretically bind just about\nevery author and publisher with a book in an American library. In particular,\nyou could craft a deal in which copyright owners, as a class, agreed to\nrelease any claims against Google for scanning and displaying their books, in\nexchange for a cut of the revenue on sales of those books.\n\n\u201cIf you have a kind of an institutional problem,\u201d said Jeff Cunard, a partner\nat Debevoise & Plimpton who represented the publishers in the case, \u201cyou can\naddress the issue through a class-action settlement mechanism, which releases\nall past claims and develops a solution on a going-forward basis. And I think\nthe genius here was of those who saw this as a way of addressing the problem\nof out-of-print books and liberating them from the dusty corners to which\nthey\u2019d been consigned.\u201d\n\nIt was a kind of hack. If you could get the class on board with your\nsettlement, and if you could convince a judge to approve it\u2014a step required by\nlaw, because you want to make sure the class representatives are acting in the\nclass\u2019s best interests\u2014then you could in one stroke cut the Gordian knot of\nambiguous rights to old books. With the class action settlement, authors and\npublishers who stayed in the class would in effect be saying to Google, \u201cgo\nahead.\u201d\n\nNaturally, they\u2019d have to get something in return. And that was the clever\npart. At the heart of the settlement was a collective licensing regime for\nout-of-print books. Authors and publishers could opt out their books at any\ntime. For those who didn\u2019t, Google would be given wide latitude to display and\nsell their books, but in return, 63 percent of the revenues would go into\nescrow with a new entity called the Book Rights Registry. The Registry\u2019s job\nwould be to distribute funds to rightsholders as they came forward to claim\ntheir works; in ambiguous cases, part of the money would be used to figure out\nwho actually owned the rights.\n\n\u201cBook publishing isn\u2019t the healthiest industry in the world, and individual\nauthors don\u2019t make any money out of out-of-print books,\u201d Cunard said to me.\n\u201cNot that they would have made gazillions of dollars\u201d with Google Books and\nthe Registry, \u201cbut they would at least have been paid something for it. And\nmost authors actually want their books to be read.\u201d\n\nWhat became known as the Google Books Search Amended Settlement Agreement came\nto 165 pages and more than a dozen appendices. It took two and a half years to\nhammer out the details. Sarnoff described the negotiations as \u201cfour-\ndimensional chess\u201d between the authors, publishers, libraries, and Google.\n\u201cEveryone involved,\u201d he said to me, \u201cand I mean everyone\u2014on all sides of this\nissue\u2014thought that if we were going to get this through, this would be the\nsingle most important thing they did in their careers.\u201d Ultimately the deal\nput Google on the hook for about $125 million, including a one-time $45\nmillion payout to the copyright holders of books it had scanned\u2014something like\n$60 per book\u2014along with $15.5 million in legal fees to the publishers, $30\nmillion to the authors, and $34.5 million toward creating the Registry.\n\nBut it also set the terms for how out-of-print books, newly freed, would be\ndisplayed and sold. Under the agreement, Google would be able to preview up to\n20 percent of a given book to entice individual users to buy, and it would be\nable to offer downloadable copies for sale, with the prices determined by an\nalgorithm or by the individual rightsholder, in price bins initially ranging\nfrom $1.99 to $29.99. All the out-of-print books would be packaged into an\n\u201cinstitutional subscription database\u201d that would be sold to universities,\nwhere students and faculty could search and read the full collection for free.\nAnd in \u00a74.8(a), the agreement describes in bland legalese the creation of an\nincomparable public utility, the \u201cpublic-access service\u201d that would be\ndeployed on terminals to local libraries across the country.\n\nSorting out the details had taken years of litigation and then years of\nnegotiation, but now, in 2011, there was a plan\u2014a plan that seemed to work\nequally well for everyone at the table. As Samuelson, the Berkeley law\nprofessor, put it in a paper at the time, \u201cThe proposed settlement thus looked\nlike a win-win-win: the libraries would get access to millions of books,\nGoogle would be able to recoup its investment in GBS, and authors and\npublishers would get a new revenue stream from books that had been yielding\nzero returns. And legislation would be unnecessary to bring about this\nresult.\u201d\n\nIn this, she wrote, it was \u201cperhaps the most adventuresome class action\nsettlement ever attempted.\u201d But to her way of thinking, that was the very\nreason it should fail.\n\n* * *\n\nThe publication of the Amended Settlement Agreement to the Authors Guild case\nwas headline news. It was quite literally a big deal\u2014a deal that would involve\nthe shakeup of an entire industry. Authors, publishers, Google\u2019s rivals, legal\nscholars, librarians, the U.S. government, and the interested public paid\nattention to the case\u2019s every move. When the presiding judge, Denny Chin, put\nout a call for responses to the proposed settlement, responses came in droves.\n\nThose who had been at the table crafting the agreement had expected some\nresistance, but not the \u201cparade of horribles,\u201d as Sarnoff described it, that\nthey eventually saw. The objections came in many flavors, but they all started\nwith the sense that the settlement was handing to Google, and Google alone, an\nawesome power. \u201cDid we want the greatest library that would ever exist to be\nin the hands of one giant corporation, which could really charge almost\nanything it wanted for access to it?\u201d, Robert Darnton, then president of\nHarvard\u2019s library, has said.\n\nDarnton had initially been supportive of Google\u2019s scanning project, but the\nsettlement made him wary. The scenario he and many others feared was that the\nsame thing that had happened to the academic journal market would happen to\nthe Google Books database. The price would be fair at first, but once\nlibraries and universities became dependent on the subscription, the price\nwould rise and rise until it began to rival the usurious rates that journals\nwere charging, where for instance by 2011 a yearly subscription to the Journal\nof Comparative Neurology could cost as much as $25,910.\n\nAlthough academics and library enthusiasts like Darnton were thrilled by the\nprospect of opening up out-of-print books, they saw the settlement as a kind\nof deal with the devil. Yes, it would create the greatest library there\u2019s ever\nbeen\u2014but at the expense of creating perhaps the largest bookstore, too, run by\nwhat they saw as a powerful monopolist. In their view, there had to be a\nbetter way to unlock all those books. \u201cIndeed, most elements of the GBS\nsettlement would seem to be in the public interest, except for the fact that\nthe settlement restricts the benefits of the deal to Google,\u201d the Berkeley law\nprofessor Pamela Samuelson wrote.\n\nCertainly Google\u2019s competitors felt put out by the deal. Microsoft,\npredictably, argued that it would further cement Google\u2019s position as the\nworld\u2019s dominant search engine, by making it the only one that could legally\nmine out-of-print books. By using those books in results for user\u2019s long-tail\nqueries, Google would have an unfair advantage over competitors. Google\u2019s\nresponse to this objection was simply that anyone could scan books and show\nthem in search results if they wanted\u2014and that doing so was fair use. (Earlier\nthis year, a Second Circuit court ruled finally that Google\u2019s scanning of\nbooks and display of snippets was, in fact, fair use.)\n\n\u201cThere was this hypothesis that there was this huge competitive advantage,\u201d\nClancy said to me, regarding Google\u2019s access to the books corpus. But he said\nthat the data never ended up being a core part of any project at Google,\nsimply because the amount of information on the web itself dwarfed anything\navailable in books. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to a book to know when Woodrow\nWilson was born,\u201d he said. The books data was helpful, and interesting for\nresearchers, but \u201cthe degree to which the naysayers characterized this as\nbeing the strategic motivation for the whole project\u2014that was malarkey.\u201d\n\nAmazon, for its part, worried that the settlement allowed Google to set up a\nbookstore that no one else could. Anyone else who wanted to sell out-of-print\nbooks, they argued, would have to clear rights on a book-by-book basis, which\nwas as good as impossible, whereas the class action agreement gave Google a\nlicense to all of the books at once.\n\nThis objection got the attention of the Justice Department, in particular the\nAntitrust division, who began investigating the settlement. In a statement\nfiled with the court, the DOJ argued that the settlement would give Google a\nde facto monopoly on out-of-print books. That\u2019s because for Google\u2019s\ncompetitors to get the same rights to those books, they\u2019d basically have to go\nthrough the exact same bizarre process: scan them en masse, get sued in a\nclass action, and try to settle. \u201cEven if there were reason to think history\ncould repeat itself in this unlikely fashion,\u201d the DOJ wrote, \u201cit would\nscarcely be sound policy to encourage deliberate copyright violations and\nadditional litigation.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s best defense was that the whole point of antitrust law was to protect\nconsumers, and, as one of their lawyers put it, \u201cFrom the perspective of\nconsumers, one way to get something is unquestionably better than no way to\nget it at all.\u201d Out-of-print books had been totally inaccessible online; now\nthere\u2019d be a way to buy them. How did that hurt consumers? A person closely\ninvolved in the settlement said to me, \u201cEach of the publishers would go into\nthe Antitrust Division and say well but look, Amazon has 80 percent of the\ne-book market. Google has 0 percent or 1 percent. This is allowing someone\nelse to compete in the digital books space against Amazon. And so you should\nbe regarding this as pro-competitive, not anti-competitive. Which seemed also\nvery sensible to me. But it was like they were talking to a brick wall. And\nthat reaction was shameful.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ held fast. In some ways, the parties to the settlement didn\u2019t have a\ngood way out: no matter how \u201cnon-exclusive\u201d they tried to make the deal, it\nwas in effect a deal that only Google could get\u2014because Google was the only\ndefendant in the case. For a settlement in a class action titled Authors Guild\nv. Google to include not just Google but, say, every company that wanted to\nbecome a digital bookseller, would be to stretch the class action mechanism\npast its breaking point.\n\nThis was a point that the DOJ kept coming back to. The settlement was already\na stretch, they argued: the original case had been about whether Google could\nshow snippets of books it had scanned, and here you had a settlement agreement\nthat went way beyond that question to create an elaborate online marketplace,\none that depended on the indefinite release of copyrights by authors and\npublishers who might be difficult to find, particularly for books long out of\nprint. \u201cIt is an attempt,\u201d they wrote, \u201cto use the class-action mechanism to\nimplement forward-looking business arrangements that go far beyond the dispute\nbefore the Court in this litigation.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ objections left the settlement in a double bind: Focus the deal on\nGoogle and you get accused of being anticompetitive. Try to open it up and you\nget accused of stretching the law governing class actions.\n\nThe lawyers who had crafted the settlement tried to thread the needle. The DOJ\nacknowledged as much. \u201cThe United States recognizes that the parties to the\nASA are seeking to use the class action mechanism to overcome legal and\nstructural challenges to the emergence of a robust and diverse marketplace for\ndigital books,\u201d they wrote. \u201cDespite this worthy goal, the United States has\nreluctantly concluded that use of the class-action mechanism in the manner\nproposed by the ASA is a bridge too far.\u201d\n\nTheir argument was compelling, but the fact that the settlement was ambitious\ndidn\u2019t mean it was illegal\u2014just unprecedented. Years later, another class-\naction settlement that involved opt-out, \u201cforward-looking business\narrangements\u201d very similar to the kind set up by the Google settlement was\napproved by another district court. That case involved the prospective\nexploitation of publicity rights of retired NFL players; the settlement made\nthose rights available to an entity that would license them and distribute the\nproceeds. \u201cWhat was interesting about it,\u201d says Cunard, who was also involved\nin that litigation, \u201cwas that not a single opponent of the settlement ever\nraised Judge Chin\u2019s decision or any of the oppositions to it with respect to\nthat settlement being \u2018beyond the scope of the pleadings.\u2019\u201d Had that case been\ndecided ten years ago, Cunard said, it would have been \u201ca very important and\nsubstantial precedent,\u201d significantly undercutting the \u201cbridge too far\u201d\nargument against the Authors Guild agreement. \u201cIt demonstrates that the law is\na very fluid thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to be first.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the DOJ\u2019s intervention likely spelled the end of the settlement\nagreement. No one is quite sure why the DOJ decided to take a stand instead of\nremaining neutral. Dan Clancy, the Google engineering lead on the project who\nhelped design the settlement, thinks that it was a particular brand of\nobjector\u2014not Google\u2019s competitors but \u201csympathetic entities\u201d you\u2019d think would\nbe in favor of it, like library enthusiasts, academic authors, and so on\u2014that\nultimately flipped the DOJ. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the settlement would have\ntranspired if those naysayers hadn\u2019t been so vocal,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not\nclear to me that if the libraries and the Bob Darntons and the Pam Samuelsons\nof the world hadn\u2019t been so active that the Justice Department ever would have\nbecome involved, because it just would have been Amazon and Microsoft bitching\nabout Google. Which is like yeah, tell me something new.\u201d\n\nWhatever the motivation, the DOJ said its piece and that seemed to carry the\nday. In his ruling concluding that the settlement was not \u201cfair, adequate, and\nreasonable\u201d under the rules governing class actions, Judge Denny Chin recited\nthe DOJ\u2019s objections and suggested that to fix them, you\u2019d either have to\nchange the settlement to be an opt-in arrangement\u2014which would render it\ntoothless\u2014or try to accomplish the same thing in Congress.\n\n\u201cWhile the digitization of books and the creation of a universal digital\nlibrary would benefit many,\u201d Chin wrote in his decision, \u201cthe ASA would simply\ngo too far.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nAt the close of the \u201cfairness hearing,\u201d where people spoke for and against the\nsettlement, Judge Chin asked, as if merely out of curiosity, just how many\nobjections had there been? And how many people had opted out of the class? The\nanswers were more than 500, and more than 6,800.\n\nReasonable people could disagree about the legality of the settlement; there\nwere strong arguments on either side, and it was by no means obvious to\nobservers which side Judge Chin was going to come down on. What seemed to turn\nthe tide against the settlement was the reaction of the class itself. \u201cIn my\nmore than twenty-five years of practice in class action litigation, I\u2019ve never\nseen a settlement reacted to that way, with that many objectors,\u201d said Michael\nBoni, who was the lead negotiator for the authors class in the case. That\nstrong reaction was what likely led to the DOJ\u2019s intervention; it turned\npublic opinion against the agreement; and it may have led Chin to look for\nways to kill it. After all, the question before him was whether the agreement\nwas fair to class members. The more class members came out of the woodwork,\nand the more upset they seemed to be, the more reason he\u2019d have to think that\nthe settlement didn\u2019t represent their interests.\n\nThe irony is that so many people opposed the settlement in ways that suggested\nthey fundamentally believed in what Google was trying to do. One of Pamela\nSamuelson\u2019s main objections was that Google was going to be able to sell books\nlike hers, whereas she thought they should be made available for free. (The\nfact that she, like any author under the terms of the settlement, could set\nher own books\u2019 price to zero was not consolation enough, because \u201corphan\nworks\u201d with un-findable authors would still be sold for a price.) In\nhindsight, it looks like the classic case of perfect being the enemy of the\ngood: surely having the books made available at all would be better than\nkeeping them locked up\u2014even if the price for doing so was to offer orphan\nworks for sale. In her paper concluding that the settlement went too far,\nSamuelson herself even wrote, \u201cIt would be a tragedy not to try to bring this\nvision to fruition, now that it is so evident that the vision is realizable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not important enough for the Congress to somehow adjust copyright\nlaw.\u201d\n\nMany of the objectors indeed thought that there would be some other way to get\nto the same outcome without any of the ickiness of a class action settlement.\nA refrain throughout the fairness hearing was that releasing the rights of\nout-of-print books for mass digitization was more properly \u201ca matter for\nCongress.\u201d When the settlement failed, they pointed to proposals by the U.S.\nCopyright Office recommending legislation that seemed in many ways inspired by\nit, and to similar efforts in the Nordic countries to open up out-of-print\nbooks, as evidence that Congress could succeed where the settlement had\nfailed.\n\nOf course, nearly a decade later, nothing of the sort has actually happened.\n\u201cIt has got no traction,\u201d Cunard said to me about the Copyright Office\u2019s\nproposal, \u201cand is not going to get a lot of traction now I don\u2019t think.\u201d Many\nof the people I spoke to who were in favor of the settlement said that the\nobjectors simply weren\u2019t practical-minded\u2014they didn\u2019t seem to understand how\nthings actually get done in the world. \u201cThey felt that if not for us and this\nlawsuit, there was some other future where they could unlock all these books,\nbecause Congress would pass a law or something. And that future... as soon as\nthe settlement with Guild, nobody gave a shit about this anymore,\u201d Clancy said\nto me.\n\nIt certainly seems unlikely that someone is going to spend political\ncapital\u2014especially today\u2014trying to change the licensing regime for books, let\nalone old ones. \u201cThis is not important enough for the Congress to somehow\nadjust copyright law,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get anyone elected.\nIt\u2019s not going to create a whole bunch of jobs.\u201d It\u2019s no coincidence that a\nclass action against Google turned out to be perhaps the only plausible venue\nfor this kind of reform: Google was the only one with the initiative, and the\nmoney, to make it happen. \u201cIf you want to look at this in a raw way,\u201d Allan\nAdler, in-house counsel for the publishers, said to me, \u201ca deep pocketed,\nprivate corporate actor was going to foot the bill for something that everyone\nwanted to see.\u201d Google poured resources into the project, not just to scan the\nbooks but to dig up and digitize old copyright records, to negotiate with\nauthors and publishers, to foot the bill for a Books Rights Registry. Years\nlater, the Copyright Office has gotten nowhere with a proposal that re-treads\nmuch the same ground, but whose every component would have to be funded with\nCongressional appropriations.\n\nI asked Bob Darnton, who ran Harvard\u2019s library during the Google Books\nlitigation and who spoke out against the settlement, whether he had any\nregrets about what ended up happening. \u201cInsofar as I have a regret, it is that\nthe attempts to out-Google Google are so limited by copyright law,\u201d he said.\nHe\u2019s been working on another project to scan library books; the scanning has\nbeen limited to books in the public domain. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of copyright, don\u2019t\nget me wrong, but really to leave books out of the public domain for more than\na century\u2014to keep most American literature behind copyright barrier,\u201d he said,\n\u201cI think is crazy.\u201d\n\nThe first copyright statute in the United States, passed in 1790, was called\nAn Act for the Encouragement of Learning. Copyright terms were to last\nfourteen years, with the option to renew for another fourteen, but only if the\nauthor was alive at the end of the first term. The idea was to strike a\n\u201cpragmatic bargain\u201d between authors and the reading public. Authors would get\na limited monopoly on their work so they could make a living from it; but\ntheir work would retire quickly into the public domain.\n\nSomewhere at Google there is a database containing 25 million books and nobody\nis allowed to read them.\n\nCopyright terms have been radically extended in this country largely to keep\npace with Europe, where the standard has long been that copyrights last for\nthe life of the author plus 50 years. But the European idea, \u201cIt\u2019s based on\nnatural law as opposed to positive law,\u201d Lateef Mtima, a copyright scholar at\nHoward University Law School, said. \u201cTheir whole thought process is coming out\nof France and Hugo and those guys that like, you know, \u2018My work is my\nenfant,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cand the state has absolutely no right to do anything with\nit\u2014kind of a Lockean point of view.\u201d As the world has flattened, copyright\nlaws have converged, lest one country be at a disadvantage by freeing its\nintellectual products for exploitation by the others. And so the American idea\nof using copyright primarily as a vehicle, per the constitution, \u201cto promote\nthe Progress of Science and useful Arts,\u201d not to protect authors, has eroded\nto the point where today we\u2019ve locked up nearly every book published after\n1923.\n\n\u201cThe greatest tragedy is we are still exactly where we were on the orphan\nworks question. That stuff is just sitting out there gathering dust and\ndecaying in physical libraries, and with very limited exceptions,\u201d Mtima said,\n\u201cnobody can use them. So everybody has lost and no one has won.\u201d\n\nAfter the settlement failed, Clancy told me that at Google \u201cthere was just\nthis air let out of the balloon.\u201d Despite eventually winning Authors Guild v.\nGoogle, and having the courts declare that displaying snippets of copyrighted\nbooks was fair use, the company all but shut down its scanning operation.\n\nIt was strange to me, the idea that somewhere at Google there is a database\ncontaining 25-million books and nobody is allowed to read them. It\u2019s like that\nscene at the end of the first Indiana Jones movie where they put the Ark of\nthe Covenant back on a shelf somewhere, lost in the chaos of a vast warehouse.\nIt\u2019s there. The books are there. People have been trying to build a library\nlike this for ages\u2014to do so, they\u2019ve said, would be to erect one of the great\nhumanitarian artifacts of all time\u2014and here we\u2019ve done the work to make it\nreal and we were about to give it to the world and now, instead, it\u2019s 50 or 60\npetabytes on disk, and the only people who can see it are half a dozen\nengineers on the project who happen to have access because they\u2019re the ones\nresponsible for locking it up.\n\nI asked someone who used to have that job, what would it take to make the\nbooks viewable in full to everybody? I wanted to know how hard it would have\nbeen to unlock them. What\u2019s standing between us and a digital public library\nof 25 million volumes?\n\nYou\u2019d get in a lot of trouble, they said, but all you\u2019d have to do, more or\nless, is write a single database query. You\u2019d flip some access control bits\nfrom off to on. It might take a few minutes for the command to propagate.\n\nJames Somers is a former contributing editor at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
