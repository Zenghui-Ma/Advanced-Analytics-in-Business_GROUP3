But protests from the country\u2019s millennials and Gen Z prompted\nthe government to reconsider.\n\nMeanwhile, SK Group the owner of Samsung\u2019s rival SK Hynix, has similarly\nimplemented biweekly Saturday meetings for its chief executives.\n\nSubscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive\nnavigate the changing needs of the workplace.
