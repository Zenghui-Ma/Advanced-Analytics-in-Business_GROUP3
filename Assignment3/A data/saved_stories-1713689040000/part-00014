Implement Long-Term Lifestyle and Behavior Changes\n\nWhen trying to lose weight, ban the word \u201cdiet,\u201d suggests Albertson. Dieting\ncan be unpleasant and make you hungry, so you constantly think about food,\nwhich is exactly what you don\u2019t want when trying to lose weight. Instead, she\nrecommends thinking of weight loss as a part of getting healthier and\nconcentrating on taking care of your body first.\n\n\u201cWeight loss is complicated and you don\u2019t have total control over the number\non the scale, but you do have control over what you eat, how much you move and\nother factors that impact weight, such as stress and sleep,\u201d says Albertson.\nShe suggests setting SMART\u2014specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and\ntime-sensitive\u2014goals and rewarding yourself when you hit them.\n\n### 2\\. Focus on the First 5% to 10%\n\nInstead of saying, \u201cI need to lose 25 pounds,\u201d and overwhelming yourself with\nwhat seems like an impossible goal, look toward the health benefits that can\ncome from even modest weight loss.\n\n\u201cSet smaller, achievable targets,\u201d suggests Bennett. \u201cLosing only 5% to 10% of\nyour total body weight (TBW) can greatly improve your health and lower your\nrisk for illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease\nand certain types of cancer.\u201d\n\n### 3\\. Reduce Your Intake of Ultra-Processed Carbs and Sweets\n\nA study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals what you\neat is most important for weight loss^[1]. The pounds will come off more\nquickly if you improve the quality of the foods you ingest.\n\n\u201cOne of the healthiest ways to shed weight is to reduce your intake of sugar\nand rapidly metabolized carbohydrates,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cIn particular, you want\nto cut out or drastically curtail your intake of high-glycemic-load foods,\nsuch as sugary snacks, processed carbs and soft drinks. When you avoid or cut\nback on French fries, chips, crackers and the like, you\u2019ll speed up your\nweight loss.\u201d\n\n### 4\\. Eat More Plants\n\nResearch shows a plant-based diet not only promotes weight loss, but is also\neasier to stick to than a low-calorie diet^[2]. Plus, it\u2019s nutrient dense and\nhas numerous health benefits.\n\n\u201cProduce supports weight loss because it\u2019s rich in fiber and water, which are\nboth calorie-free yet take up space in your stomach so you feel full,\u201d says\nAlbertson. In fact, a Brazilian study found a direct correlation between\nincreased fruit and vegetable consumption and enhanced weight loss^[3].\n\nAlbertson suggests aiming to consume five daily servings of produce to start\nand working up to seven to nine servings a day. \u201cStart your day with a green\nsmoothie, have a salad or cut up vegetables with your lunch and eat fruit for\nsnacks and desserts,\u201d she says. \u201cFor supper, have more stir frys, incorporate\nveggies into your pasta dishes and stir them into soups.\u201d\n\nFEATURED PARTNER OFFER\n\nEnjoy 1 Free Month Of Membership At Sign Up\n\nLumen Metabolism Tracker\n\n  * World\u2019s first hand-held, portable device to accurately measure metabolism\n  * Scientifically proven to meet the gold standard of metabolism measurement (RER)\n  * See how your metabolism is affected by your nutrition, physical activity and sleep\n  * Achieve sustainable weight loss with daily personalized meal plans\n  * $299 plus $19/mo, includes one free month of membership\n\nStart Now\n\nOn Lumen's Website\n\n### 5\\. Pump Up Your Protein\n\nIncreasing your protein consumption can help reduce appetite and help prevent\nthe loss of muscle mass.\n\n\u201cEating around 25 to 30 grams of protein\u2014two scoops of protein powder or 4\nounces of chicken breast\u2014per meal can improve appetite control and manage your\nbody weight,\u201d says Dr. Albertson. \u201cThe best way to do it is to make sure you\nhave one serving of high-quality protein per meal.\u201d\n\nAlbertson also says women older than 50 need significantly more protein (1 to\n1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight daily) than men and younger women (who\nrequire .8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily). \u201cWomen need\nmore protein after 50, especially as they approach menopause, because\ndecreases in the hormone estrogen result in a loss of skeletal muscle mass,\nstrength and regenerative capacity,\u201d she explains.\n\n### 6\\. Drink More Water\n\nResearch shows drinking more water is associated with weight loss independent\nof diet and exercise^[4]. Ample water intake can help increase satiety and\ncombat sugar cravings. Water is also necessary for lipolysis, the body\u2019s\nprocess of burning fat for energy.\n\n\u201cI suggest following the eight by eight rule\u20148 ounces of water eight times\nthroughout the day\u2014for a minimum water intake recommendation,\u201d says Florida-\nbased celebrity trainer Jordan Morello who works for the fitness platform\nSweat Factor. \u201cMy clients are usually surprised once they add this [rule] into\ntheir own routine [by] how much this simple thing can curb cravings and leave\nyou more satiated throughout the day.\u201d\n\nAnother water trick? Try drinking two cups of water before each meal. Studies\nhave shown this simple move can increase weight loss as well^[5].\n\n### 7\\. Eat a Well-Rounded Breakfast\n\nBreakfast skippers, listen up. If you\u2019re trying to lose weight, skimping on\nmorning fuel is not the way to go. In fact, studies consistently show skipping\nbreakfast is associated with overweight and obesity^[6].\n\nAdditionally, a study in the Proceedings of the Nutrition Society found people\nwho don\u2019t eat breakfast tend to have poorer quality diets overall, and they\nskimp on nutrients, such as vitamin D, calcium and iron^[7].\n\nBut not just any breakfast will do. \u201cTo think more clearly, perform more\nefficiently and be in better moods, you want a well-rounded, blood-sugar-\nbalanced first meal of the day with ample protein, healthy fats and what I\ncall quality carbs like fresh berries,\u201d says Bennett.\n\n### 8\\. Stand Up and Move More\n\nOne of the easiest ways to shed weight is to up your non-exercise activity\nthermogenesis (NEAT)\u2014the energy expended for everything you do outside of\neating, sleeping or exercising. Little changes like carrying your groceries\ninstead of pushing a cart, parking farther away from the entrance to the mall,\ntaking the stairs instead of the elevator or even tapping your toe can lead to\nhundreds of extra calories burned.\n\nOr try to stand more than you sit. Studies show that simply replacing sitting\nwith standing leads to a greater daily energy expenditure, which directly\ntranslates into more calories burned and ultimately pounds shed^[8].\n\nFor example, if you weigh 160 pounds and alternate sitting and standing, you\ncan burn approximately 35 additional calories an hour\u2014an extra 280 calories a\nday, 1,400 calories a week and about 70,000 calories a year.\n\n\u201cSet a timer on your phone, Fitbit or computer to remind you to get up and\nmove around every hour,\u201d says Albertson. \u201cYou\u2019ll burn more calories and may\nlower your blood sugar and risk of heart disease.\u201d\n\n### 9\\. Hit the Weights\n\nMuscle burns more calories than fat. So how do you build more muscle? Strength\ntraining.\n\nAdding resistance training to your weight loss plan is a smart idea not only\nbecause of the calories you\u2019ll burn while working out, but also because of the\n\u201cafterburn effect.\u201d\n\nKnown as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, EPOC reflects how long\noxygen uptake remains elevated after exercise in order to help muscles\nrecover. This elevation boosts metabolism both during and after strength\ntraining sessions.\n\nAnd the more muscle you add to your frame, the higher your resting metabolic\nrate (RMR). Your RMR determines how many calories your body needs to function\nat rest. The greater your RMR, the more you can eat and not gain weight.\n\n\u201cWhile cardiovascular exercise is often emphasized, strength training is key\nfor dropping pounds and maintaining weight loss, especially after age 50\nbecause muscle mass\u2014which burns calories\u2014declines at a rate of 1% to 2% per\nyear,\u201d says Albertson. \u201cStrength training can slow down muscle mass decline.\u201d\n\nFEATURED PARTNER OFFER\n\nJacked Factory Burn-XT\n\n  * Elite nootropic fat burner for both men and women\n  * Features trademarked ingredients like TeaCrine, Infinergy di-caffeine malate, and Capsimax cayenne pepper extract\n  * Boosts energy and metabolism to burn more calories throughout the day\n  * Acts as a natural appetite suppressant, controlling cravings and aiding weight loss\n\nShop Now\n\nOn Amazon\n\n### 10\\. Don\u2019t Go Overboard\n\nCutting calories too drastically or working out 24/7 may actually backfire\nwhen it comes to weight loss. Most people think shedding pounds requires\ndraconian measures to get results, but allowing yourself adequate recovery\ntime is more productive.\n\n\u201cMany people, when they get frustrated that they haven\u2019t lost weight, will\ndouble down on the stressor (i.e. catabolic phase) that they are doing,\u201d says\ncertified personal trainer Rob Darnbrough, CEO and co-founder of The Smart Fit\nMethod in California. \u201cFor example, they\u2019ll run extra miles, double up on the\namount of time they spend at the gym and/or eat less food. However, all of the\nresults we desire from doing the above things actually occur during the\nanabolic recovery phase.\u201d\n\nDuring the anabolic phase, the body builds muscle mass and loses fat mass\nwhile recovering from the stressor, explains Darnbrough. So, instead of\npushing yourself to a breaking point, which ends up leading to overtraining\nand diminished results, put as much energy into rest and nutrition as you do\ninto workouts. \u201cTo create sustainable results, try to balance your ratio of\nstress to recovery,\u201d says Darnbrough.\n\n### 11\\. Check in With an Accountability Partner\n\nSometimes losing weight can feel lonely, but you don\u2019t have to do it all by\nyourself.\n\nResearch shows being accountable works. In one study, two-thirds of\nparticipants who joined a weight loss program with friends maintained their\nweight loss for six months after the meetings ended, compared to just a\nquarter of those who attended on their own^[9]. Of course, many organizations\nalso suggest having a sponsor or champion on your path to weight loss.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to consistently eat better and shed weight steadily is\nto check in every day with an accountability partner,\u201d suggests Bennett. \u201cYour\naccountability partner doesn\u2019t need to be your bestie, favorite co-worker or\npartner. Just find someone with similar weight loss goals. You don\u2019t need to\ntalk every day, either. Just text each other to share that you\u2019re eating\nhealthy foods and staying on track. If you\u2019re tempted by junk foods, you can\nlean on your partner, too. That\u2019s when you may want to call them.\u201d\n\n### 12\\. Watch Less Television\n\nCouch surfers wanting to lose weight should turn off the TV\u2014in fact, the more\ntelevision people watch, the more weight they gain.\n\nOne study that collected data from more than 50,000 middle-aged women over six\nyears found that for every two hours the participants spent watching\ntelevision each day, they had a 23% higher risk of obesity and a 14% higher\nrisk of developing diabetes^[10].\n\nExcess television watching is correlated with extra pounds primarily because\nit\u2019s a sedentary activity that often also leads to mindless eating. So, turn\nit off or maybe change the channel to an exercise program instead.\n\n### 13\\. Reconnect With Your Satiety Cues\n\nSpeaking of mindless eating, you can reprogram your brain for weight loss by\ntuning back into your body\u2019s natural \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m full\u201d cues.\n\n\u201cDieting combined with eating on the run or while multitasking\u2014driving,\nwatching TV, playing with your phone\u2014can really disconnect you from your\nnatural signals of hunger and satiety,\u201d says Albertson. \u201cPlus, as children, we\nalso learned to clean our plates rather than eat until satisfied.\u201d Add the\nfact that portion sizes have grown significantly\u2014as much as 60% for things\nlike snack foods\u2014 and the result is consistent overeating.\n\n\u201cInstead, try to eat when you\u2019re hungry and stop when you are satisfied rather\nthan stuffed,\u201d says Albertson. \u201cInstead of tracking your food, try tracking\nhow hungry you are before, during and after meals to get back in touch with\nthese signals.\u201d\n\nTrack Your Metabolism Daily\n\nTake control of your health with Lumen and effectively monitor your\nmetabolism, boost fat-burning capabilities and achieve sustainable weight\nloss.\n\nStart Now\n\n### 14\\. Get More Sleep\n\nGetting a good night\u2019s sleep is one of the best things you can do to maintain\na healthy weight and overall health. Studies show that poor sleep is\nassociated with weight gain and other health disorders. When researchers\nanalyzed 16 years\u2019 worth of data on 68,183 middle-aged American women, they\nfound those who slept no more than five hours per night were 15% more likely\nto have obesity compared to those who slept seven hours a night^[11].\n\nInsufficient sleep may also affect the production of appetite-regulating\nhormones ghrelin and leptin, which can lead people to feel hungrier throughout\nthe day. Additionally, poor sleep increases cortisol and can result in harder-\nto-lose body and belly fat.\n\n\u201cMost of us can\u2019t control what time we have to get up, but we can control when\nwe go to bed, so counting back seven to nine hours from the time you have to\nwake up is a great tip,\u201d says Darnbrough. \u201cI also encourage the 3-2-1 rule,\nwhich means stop working three hours before bed, stop eating two hours before\nbed and stop digital stimuli one hour before bed to improve your deep sleep\nand REM.\u201d\n\n### 15\\. Find Non-Edible Substitutes for Self-Soothing\n\nThere\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called \u201ccomfort food.\u201d However, emotional eating can\nquickly derail all weight loss efforts.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel stressed, which raises cortisol levels, rather than reaching\nfor food to feel better\u2014since eating triggers the release of the feel-good\nneurotransmitter dopamine\u2014raise levels of oxytocin, the love hormone, either\nby soothing touch, playing with a pet or getting a hug,\u201d suggests Albertson.\n\nAnimal studies have found oxytocin reduces calories consumed and has positive\neffects on metabolism^[12]. A small human study also found that giving men\noxytocin over an eight-week period promoted weight loss^[13].\n\n\u201cWhile more research is needed to understand exactly how increasing oxytocin\ncan impact weight and appetite, if you\u2019re experiencing difficult emotions, a\nself-compassion break will allow you to give yourself the care you need so you\nwill be less likely to eat,\u201d says Albertson. \u201cRemember the acronym \u2018HALT,\u2019\nwhich stands for hungry, angry/anxious, lonely and tired. If you are\nphysiologically hungry, eat. If you are experiencing difficult emotions, ask,\n\u2018What do I need?\u2019 and give yourself what you truly need. If you\u2019re not hungry,\nit isn\u2019t food.\u201d\n\nUnlock The Secret To Sustainable Weight Loss\n\nNoom\u2019s 5\u2013minute quiz unlocks a weight loss program customized for you \u2013 now\nwith GLP-1 options \u2013 so you can manage your health and form habits that last.\n\nTake Your Quiz\n\nOn Noom's Website\n\n## Why Losing Weight Fast Isn\u2019t the Best Goal\n\nThough the allure of the \u201close 5 pounds in a week\u201d diet myth is strong, there\nare many reasons why speedy shedding may actually work against your best\nweight loss efforts.\n\nFirst, when people lose weight rapidly, especially via fad or crash diets,\nthey are typically unable to maintain it because the weight they lose is often\nmore muscle mass and water and less fat mass compared to people who lose\nweight gradually.\n\n\u201cMaintaining lean muscle is important in weight loss because it plays a key\nrole in metabolism,\u201d says certified health coach and author of Sugar Shock and\nBeyond Sugar Shock Connie Bennett. \u201cMuscle helps you burn more calories. But\nwhen you lose weight too quickly, you lose muscle and your body slows down\ncalorie burning. Fast weight loss can even cause permanent slowing of\nmetabolism.\u201d\n\nRapid weight loss often leads to the dreaded yo-yo weight cycling many chronic\ndieters experience. In fact, a study of former contestants on NBC\u2019s weight\nloss television show \u201cThe Biggest Loser\u201d found the more pounds dropped\nquickly, the more the participant\u2019s metabolism slowed. The study also found\nthat the contestants regained a substantial amount of their lost weight in the\nsix years following the competition^[14].\n\nAnother Australian study of 200 participants in The Lancet found that while\ndieters in the study lost the same amount of weight, the group that lost\nweight slowly lost 10% more body fat and 50% less lean muscle than the rapid\nweight loss group^[15].\n\nFurther compounding the issue, when people lose weight rapidly, appetite often\nincreases as metabolism decreases, making it almost impossible to keep the\npounds off. A study in Obesity reports our bodies prompt us to eat 100\ncalories more per day for every pound lost^[16].\n\nPopular fad diets also very often result in nutrient deficiencies. \u201cAnd rapid\nweight loss\u2014especially when you cut carbs\u2014is often largely water,\u201d says\nregistered dietitian Ellen Albertson, Ph.D., author of Rock Your Midlife.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, if daily calories are low, the body may also use muscle mass as\nfuel, further reducing metabolism, as muscle mass is metabolically active.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: Shedding weight sensibly is the way to go. Experts usually\nsay a safe rate is losing around half a pound to 2 pounds a week. With that\ngoal in mind, here are some tried-and-true ways to drop pounds and keep them\noff for good.\n\n## How Long Does It Take to Lose Weight?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends losing 1 to 2\npounds per week. Additionally, the CDC claims that people who lose weight\ngradually are more likely to keep the weight off than those who lose weight\nrapidly.\n\nHow quickly you\u2019re able to lose weight depends on factors like your age,\nhealth history, medications you\u2019re taking, how much sleep you get and your\ngenetics. Generally, you\u2019ll need to cut about 500 calories per day through\ndiet or exercise to lose one pound per week.\n\n## The Benefits of Losing Weight Safely\n\nLosing weight through healthy lifestyle changes like improved diet and\nincreased physical activity offers a host of benefits, from reductions in body\nfat to improved joint pain and more. Consider the following advantages of\nlosing weight safely.\n\nMaintain weight loss. People who lose weight gradually (1 to 2 pounds per\nweek) through lifestyle changes like healthy eating, getting regular exercise\nand stress management are more likely to keep their weight off than those who\nlose weight quickly, according to the CDC.\n\nImprove blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. Losing weight through\nlifestyle changes like getting regular physical activity and eating healthy\nfoods can help reduce the risk of high blood pressure, cholesterol, heart\nattacks and strokes, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).\nAdditionally, losing weight by implementing healthy habits may reduce the\nprogression of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes or control type 1 diabetes.\nMeanwhile, losing as little as 5% to 10% of an individual\u2019s body weight can\nhelp improve their blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nLose more body fat. One small 2017 study published in the International\nJournal of Endocrinology and Metabolism examined 42 individuals with excess\nweight or experiencing obesity found that those who participated in slow\nweight loss experienced greater reduction in body fat compared to those who\nparticipated in rapid weight loss, as well as greater decreases in waist and\nhip circumference. Those who participated in rapid weight loss, on the other\nhand, experienced greater losses in fat-free body mass, lean body mass and\ntotal body water^[17].\n\nImprovements in joint pain. Losing weight can reduce the amount of pressure on\njoints as well as inflammation associated with weight gain. Losing just 10 to\n15 pounds may significantly reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis later\nin life and may improve the severity of arthritis symptoms.\n\n## Potential Side Effects of Rapid Weight Loss\n\nLosing more than 1 to 2 pounds per week may cause side effects including loss\nof muscle, body water and bone density, and is generally not recommended.\nOther side effects of rapid weight loss may include:\n\n  * Fatigue\n  * Diarrhea\n  * Constipation\n  * Nausea\n  * Gallstones\n  * Gout\n\nAdditionally, those who lose weight rapidly are more likely to regain weight\nquickly. Consult with your health care provider to determine a plan to lose\nweight safely.\n\n## Who Should Avoid Trying to Lose Weight Fast?\n\nLosing weight fast is generally discouraged as a safe and sustainable method\nof weight loss, but children, teenagers, pregnant women and older adults\nshould be especially cautious with rapid weight loss. Consult with your\nphysician before starting a diet or exercise plan to lose weight to determine\na method of weight loss that\u2019s safe and appropriate for your health needs.\n\n## Final Thoughts on Losing Weight Fast\n\nThe best way to achieve sustainable weight loss includes implementing healthy\nlifestyle changes like eating a balanced and nutritious diet, getting regular\nexercise and managing stress. Individuals who lose weight gradually are more\nlikely to keep the weight off and reap benefits like reduced body fat,\nimproved heart health and more.\n\nMeanwhile, people who lose weight quickly are more likely to lose muscle mass\nand water weight and risk experiencing side effects like loss of bone density\nor weight regain. Speak with your doctor to determine the best weight loss\nplan for you.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n### What is the fastest way to lose weight?\n\nCutting back on calories and engaging in regular physical activity may lead to\ngradual and sustained weight loss. Experts recommend getting at least 150\nminutes of exercise per week (or 30 minutes per day five days a week) and\neating 500 fewer calories a day to lose up to 1 pound per week.\n\n### What is the best diet to lose weight quickly?\n\nThe best diet to lose weight includes unprocessed, whole foods like fruits,\nvegetables and lean meats like poultry and fish.\n\n### How can I lose weight naturally in 7 days?\n\nDrinking plenty of water (especially before a meal) and eating more fiber can\nlead to greater satiety (feeling full after eating) and may prevent\novereating, which may contribute to weight loss over time.\n\n### What\u2019s the best way to lose belly fat quickly?\n\nResearch indicates that losing weight slowly through improved eating habits\nand increased exercise may lead to reductions in body fat.\n\n### How many calories should I eat to lose weight?\n\nConsuming 500 fewer calories a day may lead to one pound of weight loss per\nweek. A calorie calculator can help you determine how many calories to aim for\nper day.\n\n## Sources\n\n### Footnotes\n\n  * Ludwig D, Ebbeling C..
