Jules Hirsch, a research physician at Rockefeller University, had\ngotten curious about weight loss in the obese. He was about to start a simple\nexperiment that would change forever the way scientists think about fat.\n\nObese people, he knew, had huge fat cells, stuffed with glistening yellow fat.\nWhat happened to those cells when people lost weight, he wondered. Did they\nshrink or did they go away? He decided to find out.\n\nIt seemed straightforward. Dr. Hirsch found eight people who had been fat\nsince childhood or adolescence and who agreed to live at the Rockefeller\nUniversity Hospital for eight months while scientists would control their\ndiets, make them lose weight and then examine their fat cells.\n\nThe study was rigorous and demanding. It began with an agonizing four weeks of\na maintenance diet that assessed the subjects\u2019 metabolism and caloric needs.\nThen the diet began. The only food permitted was a liquid formula providing\n600 calories a day, a regimen that guaranteed they would lose weight. Finally,\nthe subjects spent another four weeks on a diet that maintained them at their\nnew weights, 100 pounds lower than their initial weights, on average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr. Hirsch answered his original question \u2014 the subjects\u2019 fat cells had shrunk\nand were now normal in size. And everyone, including Dr. Hirsch, assumed that\nthe subjects would leave the hospital permanently thinner.\n\nThat did not happen. Instead, Dr. Hirsch says, \u201cthey all regained.\u201d He was\nhorrified. The study subjects certainly wanted to be thin, so what went wrong?\nMaybe, he thought, they had some deep-seated psychological need to be fat.\n\nSo Dr. Hirsch and his colleagues, including Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, who is now\nat Columbia University, repeated the experiment and repeated it again. Every\ntime the result was the same. The weight, so painstakingly lost, came right\nback. But since this was a research study, the investigators were also\nmeasuring metabolic changes, psychiatric conditions, body temperature and\npulse. And that led them to a surprising conclusion: fat people who lost large\namounts of weight might look like someone who was never fat, but they were\nvery different. In fact, by every metabolic measurement, they seemed like\npeople who were starving.\n\nBefore the diet began, the fat subjects\u2019 metabolism was normal \u2014 the number of\ncalories burned per square meter of body surface was no different from that of\npeople who had never been fat. But when they lost weight, they were burning as\nmuch as 24 percent fewer calories per square meter of their surface area than\nthe calories consumed by those who were naturally thin.\n\nThe Rockefeller subjects also had a psychiatric syndrome, called semi-\nstarvation neurosis, which had been noticed before in people of normal weight\nwho had been starved. They dreamed of food, they fantasized about food or\nabout breaking their diet. They were anxious and depressed; some had thoughts\nof suicide. They secreted food in their rooms. And they binged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Rockefeller researchers explained their observations in one of their\npapers: \u201cIt is entirely possible that weight reduction, instead of resulting\nin a normal state for obese patients, results in an abnormal state resembling\nthat of starved nonobese individuals.\u201d\n\nEventually, more than 50 people lived at the hospital and lost weight, and\nevery one had physical and psychological signs of starvation. There were a\nvery few who did not get fat again, but they made staying thin their life\u2019s\nwork, becoming Weight Watchers lecturers, for example, and, always, counting\ncalories and maintaining themselves in a permanent state of starvation.\n\n\u201cDid those who stayed thin simply have more willpower?\u201d Dr. Hirsch asked. \u201cIn\na funny way, they did.\u201d\n\nOne way to interpret Dr. Hirsch and Dr. Leibel\u2019s studies would be to propose\nthat once a person got fat, the body would adjust, making it hopeless to lose\nweight and keep it off. The issue was important, because if getting fat was\nthe problem, there might be a solution to the obesity epidemic: convince\npeople that any weight gain was a step toward an irreversible condition that\nthey most definitely did not want to have.\n\nBut another group of studies showed that that hypothesis, too, was wrong.\n\nIt began with studies that were the inspiration of Dr. Ethan Sims at the\nUniversity of Vermont, who asked what would happen if thin people who had\nnever had a weight problem deliberately got fat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis subjects were prisoners at a nearby state prison who volunteered to gain\nweight. With great difficulty, they succeeded, increasing their weight by 20\npercent to 25 percent. But it took them four to six months, eating as much as\nthey could every day. Some consumed 10,000 calories a day, an amount so\nincredible that it would be hard to believe, were it not for the fact that\nthere were attendants present at each meal who dutifully recorded everything\nthe men ate.\n\nImage\n\nJules Hirsch, a research physician at Rockefeller University, conducted a\nsimple but groundbreaking experiment on obesity nearly 50 years ago, changing\nthe way scientists think about fat.Credit...Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times\n\nOnce the men were fat, their metabolisms increased by 50 percent. They needed\nmore than 2,700 calories per square meter of their body surface to stay fat\nbut needed just 1,800 calories per square meter to maintain their normal\nweight.\n\nWhen the study ended, the prisoners had no trouble losing weight. Within\nmonths, they were back to normal and effortlessly stayed there.\n\nThe implications were clear. There is a reason that fat people cannot stay\nthin after they diet and that thin people cannot stay fat when they force\nthemselves to gain weight. The body\u2019s metabolism speeds up or slows down to\nkeep weight within a narrow range. Gain weight and the metabolism can as much\nas double; lose weight and it can slow to half its original speed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat, of course, was contrary to what every scientist had thought, and Dr.\nSims knew it, as did Dr. Hirsch.\n\nThe message never really got out to the nation\u2019s dieters, but a few research\nscientists were intrigued and asked the next question about body weight: Is\nbody weight inherited, or is obesity more of an inadvertent, almost\nunconscious response to a society where food is cheap, abundant and tempting?\nAn extra 100 calories a day will pile on 10 pounds in a year, public health\nmessages often say. In five years, that is 50 pounds.\n\nThe assumption was that environment determined weight, but Dr. Albert Stunkard\nof the University of Pennsylvania wondered if that was true and, if so, to\nwhat extent. It was the early 1980s, long before obesity became what one\nsocial scientist called a moral panic, but a time when those questions of\nnature versus nurture were very much on Dr. Stunkard\u2019s mind.\n\nHe found the perfect tool for investigating the nature-nurture question \u2014 a\nDanish registry of adoptees developed to understand whether schizophrenia was\ninherited. It included meticulous medical records of every Danish adoption\nbetween 1927 and 1947, including the names of the adoptees\u2019 biological\nparents, and the heights and weights of the adoptees, their biological parents\nand their adoptive parents.\n\nDr. Stunkard ended up with 540 adults whose average age was 40. They had been\nadopted when they were very young \u2014 55 percent had been adopted in the first\nmonth of life and 90 percent were adopted in the first year of life. His\nconclusions, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1986, were\nunequivocal. The adoptees were as fat as their biological parents, and how fat\nthey were had no relation to how fat their adoptive parents were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe scientists summarized it in their paper: \u201cThe two major findings of this\nstudy were that there was a clear relation between the body-mass index of\nbiologic parents and the weight class of adoptees, suggesting that genetic\ninfluences are important determinants of body fatness; and that there was no\nrelation between the body-mass index of adoptive parents and the weight class\nof adoptees, suggesting that childhood family environment alone has little or\nno effect.\u201d\n\nIn other words, being fat was an inherited condition.\n\nDr. Stunkard also pointed out the implications: \u201cCurrent efforts to prevent\nobesity are directed toward all children (and their parents) almost\nindiscriminately. Yet if family environment alone has no role in obesity,\nefforts now directed toward persons with little genetic risk of the disorder\ncould be refocused on the smaller number who are more vulnerable. Such persons\ncan already be identified with some assurance: 80 percent of the offspring of\ntwo obese parents become obese, as compared with no more than 14 percent of\nthe offspring of two parents of normal weight.\u201d\n\nA few years later, in 1990, Dr. Stunkard published another study in The New\nEngland Journal of Medicine, using another classic method of geneticists:\ninvestigating twins. This time, he used the Swedish Twin Registry, studying\nits 93 pairs of identical twins who were reared apart, 154 pairs of identical\ntwins who were reared together, 218 pairs of fraternal twins who were reared\napart, and 208 pairs of fraternal twins who were reared together.\n\nThe identical twins had nearly identical body mass indexes, whether they had\nbeen reared apart or together. There was more variation in the body mass\nindexes of the fraternal twins, who, like any siblings, share some, but not\nall, genes.\n\nThe researchers concluded that 70 percent of the variation in peoples\u2019 weights\nmay be accounted for by inheritance, a figure that means that weight is more\nstrongly inherited than nearly any other condition, including mental illness,\nbreast cancer or heart disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe results did not mean that people are completely helpless to control their\nweight, Dr. Stunkard said. But, he said, it did mean that those who tend to be\nfat will have to constantly battle their genetic inheritance if they want to\nreach and maintain a significantly lower weight.\n\nThe findings also provided evidence for a phenomenon that scientists like Dr.\nHirsch and Dr. Leibel were certain was true \u2014 each person has a comfortable\nweight range to which the body gravitates. The range might span 10 or 20\npounds: someone might be able to weigh 120 to 140 pounds without too much\neffort. Going much above or much below the natural weight range is difficult,\nhowever; the body resists by increasing or decreasing the appetite and\nchanging the metabolism to push the weight back to the range it seeks.\n\nThe message is so at odds with the popular conception of weight loss \u2014 the\nmantra that all a person has to do is eat less and exercise more \u2014 that Dr.\nJeffrey Friedman, an obesity researcher at the Rockefeller University, tried\nto come up with an analogy that would convey what science has found about the\npowerful biological controls over body weight.\n\nHe published it in the journal Science in 2003 and still cites it:\n\n\u201cThose who doubt the power of basic drives, however, might note that although\none can hold one\u2019s breath, this conscious act is soon overcome by the\ncompulsion to breathe,\u201d Dr. Friedman wrote. \u201cThe feeling of hunger is intense\nand, if not as potent as the drive to breathe, is probably no less powerful\nthan the drive to drink when one is thirsty. This is the feeling the obese\nmust resist after they have lost a significant amount of weight.\u201d\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMay 12, 2007\n\n:\n\nAn article in Science Times on Tuesday about the role of genes in weight gain\nmisstated the publication date for an article in the journal Science\ndescribing the biological controls over body weight.
