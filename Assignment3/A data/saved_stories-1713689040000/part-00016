Unfortunately few people are making a serious effort to\nsteel man the case for wireheading. The concept of wireheading tends to be a\nconversation stopper, and is frequently used as a reductio-ad-absurdum for\nvalence utilitarianism. Hedonism is a low-status philosophy at the time, but\nthis may be the result of what amounts to dumb reasons (i.e. going against it\nsignals intellectual sophistications). Let\u2019s be meta-contrarian for a moment\nand think critically about it. What would a good case for wireheading look\nlike? In what follows I will (1) provide an account of what is known about\nemotional dynamics over time, (2) discuss the known pitfalls of current\nwireheading methods, (3) propose a system to overcome these pitfalls, and (4)\nmake the case that combining wireheading (done right) with a systematic\nexploration of the state-space of consciousness might ultimately be our saving\ngrace against the perils of Darwinism at the evolutionary limit.\n\nLet us begin by enriching our understanding of the nature of bliss and its\ntemporal dynamics:\n\n## The Cube of Euphoria\n\nA little over a year ago I conducted a study to figure out the main dimensions\nalong which psychotropic drugs influence people. The State-Space of Drug\nEffects consists of six main dimensions: fast euphoria, slow euphoria,\nspiritual euphoria, clarity, perception of overall value, and external vs.\ninternal source of interest. The first three dimensions are directly related\nto pleasure, which makes them relevant for our current discussion.\n\nSlow | Fast\n\nSpiritual | Fast\n\nSpiritual | Slow\n\nFast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or anticipate\nthat something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience\nif you take opioids or depressants, receive massages or hug a loved one.\nSpiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily\ncomings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to\nthe way we represent \u201cthe big picture\u201d. Those who seek it try to induce it by\nmethods that include philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or\npsychedelic drug use.\n\nTwo out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion\nclassification space of valence and arousal (also called core affect). Valence\nis how good the experience feels, whereas arousal deals with the intensity of\nthe experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the\ncube of euphoria by changing the basis used to represent the valence-arousal\nspace. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast\neuphoria projection by 45 degrees:\n\nThe valence-arousal dimensional classification of emotions.\n\nA change of basis by turning the space 90 degrees. Fast and Slow euphoria are\ntwo of three dimensions of the cube of euphoria.\n\nAs we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to \u201chigh-valence high-arousal\u201d\nwhile slow euphoria is equivalent to \u201chigh-valence low-arousal\u201d. This basis is\nnot uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes are usually\nlabeled \u201cpositive and negative activation\u201d. We will use a yellow-red circle to\nrepresent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I\nchose this color-coding by reasoning that warm colors are a better\nrepresentation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas cool colors\nillustrate better the feelings of cooling off and relaxing. I happen to prefer\nthe fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a\nhelpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when\nwe get to steel-manning wireheading later on.\n\n## Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms\n\nIt is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a\nsurprisingly small effect on your overall level of happiness. One tends to\nalways orbit around one\u2019s hedonic set-point (our mean valence and arousal\nvalues). Although our average sense of wellbeing does change from context to\ncontext (in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens,\naccomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the\nenvironmental effect usually washes out over time by one\u2019s internal negative\nfeedback mechanisms. The ability to achieve lasting happiness, it turns out,\nwas not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust\nre-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of\nwellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some\npeople are lucky to be born hyperthymic and enjoy life the majority of the\ntime. Genetically-determined pain-thresholds do not only influence how one\nresponds to physical discomfort, but also predict the size of one\u2019s social\nnetwork (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).\n\nLess well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal\ncorrelation. According to a 2007 study by Peter Kuppens, the conventional\nwisdom in affective psychology that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is\nnot quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with\narousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no\ncorrelation between these two dimensions.\n\nThis means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good)\nat the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and when they feel\nbad they tend to also have low levels of energy. On the other extreme there\nare those who experience bliss by tuning the energy down and relaxing, and\nprimarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as\nirritation, worry and anger).\n\nThe study showed that the correlation between valence and arousal was person-\nspecific (negative for ~30%, positive for ~30%, no correlation for ~40% of\npeople).\n\nWhat else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns\nof core affect are related to personality factors. People\u2019s level of variance\nin the valence dimension is an important component of neuroticism. Although\nmost neurotics tend to hang out in low-valence states, there are indeed very\nhappy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great\nfeelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability\nof valence rather than its absolute value that results in the coping\nmechanisms typical of this dimension. Likewise, higher variability in arousal\nis a component of extraversion, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example). Openness\nto experience can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in\nvalence, so that more open individuals are more likely to experience euphoria\nof all kinds when learning new information relative to people who describe\nthemselves as conventional. Conscientious individuals feel very rewarded when\nthey complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they\ndo not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive\nperception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to\nexist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of\nothers is to increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations.\nIn brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-\ndescribe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a\nsignature behavior in the valence-arousal space.\n\nIn a paper titled A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model\nfor Affective Dynamics, Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes\ninto account many important features that had previously been overlooked for\nthe sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features\nturn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model\nthat incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences\nbetween people. Their model describes people as having: a latent home base\n(hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between\nvalence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the\nhome base determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to estimate\nperson-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported\nemotional states). In turn, once you have determined someone\u2019s latent\nparameters, the model can help you predict their future affect based on their\ncurrent state.\n\nThe \u201chow fast you are pushed towards your baseline\u201d vector field.\n\nTwo example walks over time in core affect space having different hedonic set-\npoints.\n\nThe effect of parameters\n\nThis model is perhaps as good as it gets if you are restricted by a Markov\nassumption and given only the valence and arousal dimensions of the\nparticipants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular,\nthough. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the\ndimension of spiritual euphoria) may go a long way in clarifying the nature of\nunexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large\neffect of philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal\nepiphanies?\n\n## A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities\n\nBack between 2012 to 2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion\ntransitions. I did this first as part of a research project for a company I\nworked for (thanks Kanjoya!) and it then transformed into the topic of my\nmasters\u2019 thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some\nmore on a paper I wrote with colleagues on predicting future emotions based on\na sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*\n\nThe analysis I worked on was made on a sample of hundreds of thousands of\nusers of the now-defunct (but still browsable) Experience Project social\nnetwork. Participants would have the option to record their mood on the\nlanding page: they would select an emotion from a list of 176 words, say how\nintense this emotion was at the time (from 1 to 5) and explain why they feel\nthe way they do (open text; optional). I analyzed the transition probability\nbetween each ordered pair of emotions for different intervals of time and\ncompressed it into a score that describes the overall flow of people between\nthem. This results in a flow graph that we can analyze with tools from graph\ntheory. I explored many ways of clustering this graph and ultimately settled\non a method that generated the best predictive power on a model to forecast\nfuture emotions. This method consisted of grouping the emotions in such a way\nthat each emotion would maximize its mean transition probability to other\nemotions in the same group (relative to other groups). For the paper I made\nthis graph with all of the emotions (nodes), the transition probabilities\nbetween them (edge thickness) and the resulting clusters (colors):\n\nA weighted directed graph with 176 nodes, each representing a distinct state\nof consciousness. The edges represent the (directed) compressed transition\nprobability between each ordered pair of states. The size of each node\napproximates the base rate at which the emotion occurs in the sample.\n\nEach color represents a given \u201cemotion attractor\u201d. At a high level, we can say\nthat whenever you are experiencing an emotion that is e.g. green you are more\nlikely to transition to other emotions that are also green (relative to what\nwould be expected from choosing an emotion randomly). This analysis is\nultimately consistent with Oravecz et al.\u2019s model in the sense that both\nanalysis study the dynamic way in which people tend to get in and out of their\nhome base. However, the granularity afforded by the 176 different options also\nallowed me to examine the deviations from this pattern. I investigated the\nquestion: \u201cWhich emotions take you to places that are inconsistent with the\ngeneral trend of stochastically moving towards the central hedonic set-point?\u201d\n\nIt turns out that some emotions behave in interesting ways. Some are what we\ncalled \u201chubs\u201d: common stopping points that work as a route between any two\ncolors. For example, \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201ctired\u201d are hubs, and they do not give you\nmuch information about past or future emotions. Some other emotions behave\nlike \u2018gateways\u2019 in the sense that they tend to indicate a jump from a\nparticular color to another. For example, \u2018hopeful\u2019 and \u2018relieved\u2019 are two\n\u2018gateway\u2019 emotions: they work as stepping stones from blue (depressive)\nemotions to green (positive) ones.\n\nSome emotions challenge the hedonic treadmill by virtue of predicting\nunexpectedly long-lasting stays on a given color. For example, the words\n\u201cblessed\u201d, \u201cblissful\u201d and \u201cloved\u201d were great predictors of long-lasting green\nemotions. By examining the text of these mood updates we determined that on\naverage the people listing religious and spiritual themes as the cause of\ntheir feelings were more likely to stay for longer periods of time in the zone\nof positive emotions than most other people in the sample. I suppose that\npeople\u2019s spiritual euphoria may hack the pattern of hedonic habituation to\nsome extent in a few lucky ones. I personally do not think that this is a\nscalable solution for everyone, though, since not everyone is spiritually\noriented or has their endogenous opioid system wired up properly for\nmeditation. The outstanding effect sizes we may see in some people who benefit\nfrom a particular e.g. meditation technique rarely generalize to everyone\nelse. That said, it is certainly neat to see some evidence of some\n(spiritual/philosophical) sabotage at the mill.\n\n## How can we feel better in the long term?\n\nA few years ago I abandoned hope in the idea that psychological interventions\nare sufficient to increase our wellbeing (philosophy, spirituality and\nexposure therapy can only take you so far in making you feel better). So what\nis next? The trick will be to combine psychological, chemical, electrical and\ngenetic methods together in a balanced and healthy way and forget about\nrelying on a single method. Can we be happy all the time? Let us move on to\nthe subject of wireheading more directly. Given what we have discussed about\ncore affect, emotion dynamics and the resilience of the hedonic set-point, is\nit possible to wirehead oneself in a non-regrettable way? I think that the\nanswer is yes, but we will need to avoid some crucial dangers...\n\n## Wireheading Done Wrong I: Forgetting About the Negative Feedback\n\nFast and slow euphoria can be reliably triggered by sensorial or chemical\nmethods. However, doing so quickly kick-starts two negative feedback\nmechanisms.\n\nCurrent hedonic negative feedback dynamics.\n\nThe first one is that the effect is reduced (shown in the image as the little\nloops with a minus sign) with each use. And the second one is that withdrawing\nfrom these euphoric states kindles circuits that do the opposite of what was\nintended (as shown by the arrows with a positive sign). Too much of something\nthat calms you is going to bring about a long and withdrawn state of constant\nlow-level anxiety. Too much of anything that makes you up-beat and ecstatic is\ngoing to induce a long and withdrawn state of low-level depression.\n\nAmphetamines, traditional opioids, barbiturates and empathogens can be ruled\nout as wise tools for positive hedonic recalibration. They are not\ncomprehensive life enrichers precisely because it is not possible (at least as\nof 2016) to control the negative feedback mechanism that they kick-start.\nSimply pushing the button of pleasure and hoping it will all be alright is not\nan intelligent strategy given our physiological implementation. The onset of\nthis negative feedback often triggers addictive behavior and physiological\nchanges that shape the brain to expect the substance.\n\nThe case of spiritual/philosophical euphoria is a lot trickier. It is clear\nthat there is a negative feedback that may be described (more or less) as a\nsort of philosophical boredom. Psychedelics are capable of changing our brain\nso as to increase the range of possible valence (i.e. they can enable states\nof extreme pleasure but also extreme suffering) in a way that sidesteps the\nneed to directly interact with our pleasure centers. I think it is extremely\nimportant to figure out the mechanism of action of psychedelic bliss. We will\nin fact address it in another article. For now it will suffice to say that\npsychedelic pleasure does not seem to induce cravings or withdrawal. We should\ntake a close look at it because it may be the key to understanding how to\nproduce unlimited positive valence with no negative repercussions.\nUnfortunately, producing philosophical, spiritual and psychedelic bliss\nnowadays is still more of an art than a science; these methods are unreliable\nand can backfire tremendously.\n\nIn summary, we might say that if one is oblivious to negative feedback, then\nmeth addiction is an attempt at fast euphoria wireheading, whereas opioid\ndependence is the result of trying (ineffectively) to obtain boundless slow\neuphoria. Spiritual euphoria wireheading attempts usually involve activities\nsuch as philosophy, meditation, prayer and psychedelic drug use. Even though\nattempting spiritual euphoria wireheading on oneself is a hell of a lot\nhealthier than doing meth or heroin, it is certainly not free from possible\npsychological side effects (such as acquiring bizarre beliefs or experiencing\nevents- sometimes profoundly distressing- of spiritual dysphoria and unwanted\nchanges in one\u2019s belief system).\n\n## Wireheading Done Wrong II: Seduced by a World of Your Own\n\nOne simple approach to wireheading effectively is to remove either one or both\nof the negative feedback mechanisms shown in the image above. Wiring\nelectrodes into one\u2019s pleasure centers does the trick just fine, since it\napparently removes both. It turns out that the mechanism for generating\nphysiological tolerance is bypassed by direct electric (rather than chemical)\nstimulation to the nucleus accumbens. Bliss obtained this way does not seem to\nstop pouring nor diminish in greatness over time. Unfortunately this method\nhas profound pitfalls. Most salient of all is that if given the choice, mice\n(and some but not all people) will continuously self-stimulate this way as\nfrequently and as intensely as possible, neglecting both physiological needs\n(like food and sleep) and social demands (like feeding one\u2019s children or\npaying taxes). In the case of humans, people feel compelled to self-stimulate\nwhen suffering, but under normal circumstances (if feeling good already) they\ncan hold off from pressing the button in order to carry out other activities.\nAdmittedly this is an improvement over drugs, which make you feel terrible in\nthe long run and in turn make you seek relief with the same method that\nbrought you there. With electrical rather than chemical stimulation we can at\nleast avoid this pitfall. That said, people do not like to have objects\nimplanted in their brain, and our infection-prone future will thank us for not\ndeveloping an addictive technology that requires a constant stream of\nineffective antibiotics to keep it plugged in place. Thankfully future\nwireheading may be minimally invasive. Attractive alternatives to old-\nfashioned electrodes include body-powered wireless implants, optogenetics, and\ngenetically encoded magnetic triggers of neural activity.\n\nA much more subtle way to try to improve one\u2019s hedonic set point is by\ncounteracting the activation of the post-pleasure dysphoria only. Anti-\ndepressants of the SSRI variety and the less well-known fast-acting\naminoguanidine agmatine help prevent gross kindling of circuits that produce\nunpleasant sensations. This method may ultimately come down to increasing the\namount of noise in the entire system** and thus reducing the survivability of\nhighly-ordered states (such as pain and pleasure) in one\u2019s consciousness.\nPreventing withdrawal by this method comes at the cost of blunting high-\nvalence states, unfortunately. Prolonged SSRI use often makes people anhedonic\nand feel like they have lost all zest for life. In contrast, Ibogaine and low-\ndose opioid antagonists are promising chemical avenues to attack the same\nproblem in a very different way without such side-effects. These compounds\nwork by rebalancing one\u2019s proportion of the various opioid receptor subtypes\nand in turn driving one\u2019s hedonic capacity upwards (for some reason I don\u2019t\nunderstand).\n\nA whole generation of people will probably be \u201clost\u201d to what I call single\neuphoria wireheading: let\u2019s say that you have mastered the ability to\nexperience a high level of fast euphoria in a sustainable way. You can in\nprinciple stop at any point and come down without feeling like you are missing\nout. But whenever you do activate the fast euphoria you are about ten times\nmore motivated to go out, explore the world, work on projects and meet great\npeople who also share your newfound interests and values. You may end up\nchoosing to join a community of other people who value living fast and staying\nhyper-motivated, just as you do now.\n\nSuper-symmetric states may maximize valence locally. Whether their continuous\ninstantiation is evolutionarily adaptive is still up unknown.\n\nA World of Your Own: If you can modify the parameters of your own qualia\nvalues, you can perceive yourself as being in the best possible world.\n\nAnd the children? (cf. http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/13/growing-children-\nfor-bostroms-disneyland/)\n\nFast euphoria in particular is extremely tricky to program correctly, since it\ndeals so directly with behavioral reinforcement. Many people get hooked on\nmeth + X rather than on just meth: whether X is music, gaming, sex, gambling,\nporn and/or alcohol, during a meth binge people often end up doing the exact\nsame repetitive but pleasant task for tens of hours. In other words, fast\neuphoria not only reinforces itself, but it also reinforces whatever activity\nyou do while you experience it, and this is especially the case if the\nactivity is more enjoyable as a result of the fast euphoria. Stimulant\naddiction, deep brain stimulation and manic states in bipolar sufferers share\na core personality-changing effect driven by an excessive interest in a few\nrewarding activities at the expense of all other interests and\nresponsibilities. It is extremely tricky to rationally use one\u2019s reinforcement\nsystem directly in order to recalibrate one\u2019s hedonic tone. Without (as-of-\nyet-uninvented) safeguards, doing so tends to increase impulsivity in the long\nterm and mess up one\u2019s preference architecture.\n\nWe could in principle block the metabolic pathways that lead to changes in\none\u2019s motivational system as a response to fast euphoria. If we did this, then\npeople might be able to master side-effect-free hyper-motivation. Does this\nmean that a straightforward road to Super-Happiness is short-cutting to\nperpetual motivation?\n\nThe main problem is that motivation and one\u2019s implicit notion of our self-in-\ntime interact in unpredictable ways. One of the very mechanisms of action by\nwhich something like meth can transform your preference architecture is by\nforcibly redefining your self-model (cf. Ontological Qualia). Fast euphoria\nbrings one\u2019s attention towards the present moment and present happenings. In\nhigh amounts, it brings you face to face with your own presence in the eternal\nnow. From that point of view, it feels as if that very moment is who you are,\nand one\u2019s normal state of consciousness is re-interpreted as a mere jumping\nplatform at the service of the few and far apart moments of real joy. To have\nan episode of feeling \u201ctruly alive\u201d and returning to typical human conditions\ncan unquestionably be felt as a sort of death -one not of the biological body\nbut of the fleeting self-models that inhabited such sharper and subjectively\nmore worthwhile state-spaces of consciousness.\n\nIf one\u2019s implicit self-model is not robust against sudden changes in one\u2019s\nlevel of fast euphoria, then one will not be good at surviving and being\nproductive in a social economy. Let us say that person A is able to identify\nherself with her future self in 2059 and save for retirement, but person A on\nmeth has a very hard time thinking of herself in any other terms than \u201cme,\nright now, for as long as I can stay in this state of mind, 3 to 9 hours, give\nor take, depending on whether I redose.\u201d The present moment, the immediate\nfuture and the pleasure opportunities available in it can be so salient that\nthey eclipse one\u2019s every other interest. If we do not find a way to prevent\nthis shift in perspective it may be impossible to safeguard rationality when\nshowered with streams of high-grade fast euphoria.\n\nHow about slow euphoria wireheading? I suspect that it is in principle\npossible to master hyper-relaxation without being incapacitated. In the\nmeantime, trying to slow down too much does seem to reduce one\u2019s productivity\nby a good margin, so wireheading of the slow euphoria type is not currently\nadvisable. That said, achieving hedonic recalibration by guaranteeing a\nminimum of slow euphoria is, as I see it, a lot more feasible than doing so\nthrough fast euphoria. Slow euphoria does not have the explosive effects on\none\u2019s motivational architecture and self-models that fast euphoria does. On\nthe contrary, relaxation can allow us to reconceive of ourselves as beings who\ninhabit much longer timelines (to really grasp our decades-long lifespan and\nknow how to pace ourselves rather than feeling pressed to identify with our\npresent moment exclusively).\n\nSpiritual euphoria may or may not necessarily imply changes in one\u2019s belief\nstructure. Currently, peak spiritual/philosophical states (including high\nlevels of psychedelia) are a rather different kind of subjective wellbeing\nthan the other two that dominate our everyday life. This bliss is often\nassociated with extreme changes in the quality of one\u2019s conceptualization of\nreality, which limits its effective incorporation into a rational and\neconomically productive being. Unless, of course... one is producing useful\ninformation in those states. More about this further below.\n\nIn summary: If a device is ever discovered that allows people to enjoy fast,\nslow or spiritual euphoria without implicitly influencing their worldview and\neconomic capacity, then that device will probably become a staple of life.\nIssues of authorship and agency aside, single euphoria wireheading without\nserious engineering to counter its problems is a road to oblivion from the\npoint of view of evolution. Whether controlled single euphoria wireheading can\nbe adaptive is still up for debate.\n\n## Wireheading Done Wrong III: Becoming a Pure Replicator (Even If You Love\nIt)\n\nLook, we are all friends here. We are trying to delay for as long as possible\nthe development of a Singleton (i.e. a state of complete control by one\nsystem), while we also try to keep at bay the problem of Moloch*** (i.e.\ncomplete lack of control). We are trying to find a sustainable solution\nagainst both extremes. In our ideal world, all beings should have the freedom\nto explore the state-space of consciousness however they want (or live in an\nArchipelago of societies at the very least). We need to work together on\ndesigning the future to avoid evolutionary extremes and safeguard freedom of\nconsciousness. Now, who is the enemy?\n\n### The Threat of Pure Replicators\n\nI will define a pure replicator, in the context of agents and minds, to be an\nintelligence that is indifferent towards the valence of its conscious states\nand those of others. A pure replicator invests all of its energy and resources\ninto surviving and reproducing, even at the cost of continuous suffering to\nthemselves or others. Its main evolutionary advantage is that it does not need\nto spend any resources making the world a better place.\n\nIf given the choice, please don\u2019t become a pure replicator and throw under the\nbus all the hard work that people throughout history have put into making the\nworld not an entirely horrible place. Pure replicators may come in many\nguises. While the term pure replicator may invoke images of cockroaches and\nviruses in one\u2019s mind, the truth is that your modafinil-fueled income-\nmaximizing coworker may already be on the path of turning into one. Wait, what\ndid you just read?\n\nConsidering that the dimension of spiritual euphoria is the most intense (and\nsubjectively profound) source of conscious value, it would be a shame if our\nsociety exclusively optimized for linear logico-linguistic \u201chigh clarity\u201d\nstates of consciousness. Of all the drugs available, when balancing side\neffects and overall effectiveness, it is likely that modafinil-like compounds\n(e.g. custom nootropics) give you the single largest economic edge within this\nsociety. Caffeine is already available to everyone, speed slowly kills you and\nmicro-dosed LSD makes you (believe it or not) too creative for most paying\njobs. Is it possible to make the interesting and valuable states of\nconsciousness the ones that are economically rewarded? Are we going to let the\neconomic incentives in our society silently maximize the presence of\nmodafinil-like states of consciousness?\n\nThere is no known substance that enhances both \u201cclarity\u201d and\n\u201cspiritual/philosophical euphoria\u201d at the same time. It would be a shame if\nall the economy cared about was your level of clarity, for that would mean\nthat modafinil junkies users will rule the world. (Oh, wait...). At the limit,\nsuch a world may be impervious to conceptual revolutions or caring about\nvalence research. Image Source.\n\nIn practice, unless digital AGI pans out or nanotechnology takes over, pure\nreplicators are going to need to interface with human and posthuman markets to\ngain any power. Although fashionable to think about nowadays, exotic nanotech\nand/or AI pure replicators may ultimately be far easier to stop than pure\nreplicators that disguise themselves as humans (i.e. people who turn into\nempty shells of their former selves by embracing hyper-competitive Moloch\nmemes and their associated technologies). As we will see, the nature of future\neconomic selection pressures may be the most important factor in whether or\nnot we are taken over by armies of pure replicators.\n\n### Aren\u2019t we all pure replicators already?\n\nTautologically, natural selection can only produce pure replicators. But this\nwould be to think of the term in an unhelpful way that is not true to the\nspirit of the idea. This is why we defined pure replicators in terms of\nindifference towards conscious states. Most animals do indeed care a great\ndeal about the valence of their own consciousness; after all, the motivational\npower of the pleasure-pain axis is the very reason why evolution recruited\nconscious valence to begin with. More so, sexual selection happens to have\nrecruited introspection, aesthetics, benevolence and intelligence as fitness-\nindicators (which explains why we are so keen on advertising these traits).\nBrian Tomasik calls our times the Age of Spandrels because we live in a period\nthat is reaping the benefits of surplus production (still being below carrying\ncapacity) while silly non-optimal aesthetics inherited from our evolutionary\npast still survive. Interpersonal love, sexually selected hedonistic social\nrituals and ingrained prosocial implicit values may be evolutionary spandrels\nin the context of our economy, but (surprisingly) they are still part of our\nsociety. Hence, we today can enjoy watching movies, making love and thinking\nabout philosophy. Our drive to delight in life is powerful enough to distract\nus from optimal economic participation, and our emotional wellbeing (which\naffects our economic participation) is still linked to events dealing with our\nlevel of pleasure outside work.\n\nIn contrast, the intelligent agents of the future may not be constrained to\nusing the pleasure-pain axis to implement goal-oriented behaviors. One could\nenvision scenarios like Robin Hanson\u2019s Age of EM in which the most productive\n(and abundant) minds do 99.9999% of the work, and this work is boring 99.9999%\nof the time. These minds may work while in near-neutral states of\nconsciousness that have either negligibly positive or even outright negative\nvalence. The employees of this massive workforce are those individuals who are\nwilling to do whatever they are told for 0.00001% vacation time and the\nopportunity to stay alive and multiply (in this case by copying the minds in\ndigital servers). The employers may themselves not be particularly happy\nbecause they are also competing against other companies that cut down on costs\nas much as possible. If smiling does not increase one\u2019s productivity at one\u2019s\njob but it does waste precious calories and units of attention, then smiling\nwill be abolished for purely economic reasons. In this scenario everyone is\neither employed and miserable (relative to our current standards), or\nunemployed and dying of starvation. We can thank those entities who were\nwilling to completely sacrifice their own psychological depth (and freedom to\nexplore the state-space of consciousness) for the sake of merely existing. The\nworld now fails to produce any actual value in the form of meaningful states\nof consciousness and is over-saturated with modafinil-like consciousness.\n\nSingleton and Moloch end-of-times scenarios tend to look pretty terrible\nbecause the worlds they present don\u2019t seem to contain reasons for anyone to\ncare about valence.\n\nBut in this day and age we may be on the brink of reverse-engineering valence\nitself. Once we figure out the equation that takes as input quantum fields and\noutputs the conscious valence present in them, we will be able to quantify\njust exactly how bad our possible futures-at-the-limit will be depending on\nthe economic selection pressures that we put in place today.\n\nA desirable Singleton should at the very least care about states of high-\nvalence and avoid negative valence states as much as possible. In a future\narticle we will discuss some ideas for how to design an economic system based\non cooperation that increases our chances of having ecologies of sustainable\nconscious entities who have the following properties: (1) they are free to\nexplore the state-space of consciousness, (2) are social, and (3) have access\nto practically unlimited positive valence. But what if we are headed towards a\nperpetual Moloch (failure of cooperation) scenario?\n\n## Surviving in the Sundown of the Age of Spandrels\n\n> \u2018[I]n Time any being that is spontaneous and alive will wither and die like\n> an old joke.\u2019\n>\n> \u2013 (WL 111)\n\nWhat would be a list of desirable traits that we want to have after acquiring\ncomplete control over our individual pleasure-pain axis? David Pearce doesn\u2019t\nget tired of pointing out that the future does not belong to anti-natalists.\nTheir compassionate genes will be weeded out of the gene pool, and it will be\ntheir own compassionate sentimental fault. Similarly, full-blown single\neuphoria wireheading (as discussed above) is destined for oblivion unless it\nalso happens to give you marketable skills.\n\nWe want to be able to both feel good and at the same time remain economically\ncompetitive (or we are going to be crowded out by pure replicators). Here is a\nlist of traits that would help us have lives worth living without sacrificing\nour economic value:\n\n  1. Always in a positive valence state (i.e. remaining above hedonic zero).\n  2. Faithful/good enough internal simulation of one\u2019s environment (both physical and social).\n  3. Free to explore at will the known state-space of consciousness.\n  4. Capable of producing socially-useful information.\n  5. Free from unconscious bonds and protected against mind control.\n  6. Capable of exiting attractor states (affective, cognitive, social e.g. thought loops).\n  7. Able to make others happier in ways they did not know were possible.\n\nTrans/Post-human negative feedback mechanisms. It is a virtuous cycle that\ndelivers hearty amounts of euphoria but with no craving as a result. What\u2019s\nreinforced is the flow between the types of euphoria rather than each kind on\nits own.\n\nThe first trait matters for ethical reasons: one needs to guarantee that the\nentities you bring into existence will always be happy to be alive. One should\nnever compromise on the wellbeing of the beings one designs and gives birth\nto. If someone does, then we are again off to the races against pure\nreplicators willing to suffer for a chance to exist.\n\nThe second trait is a requirement to survive in a physical world and a social\neconomy (for obvious reasons).\n\nThe third trait is motivated by both ethical and practical reasons: as I\nunderstand it, having the ability to explore the known state-space of\nconsciousness guarantees that you yourself can benefit from whatever awesome\nthings people have made and discovered already. It guarantees that each\nindividual will be able to experience the most valuable states (as judged by\nthemselves at the time) without a preconceived notion of which states are the\nmost ideal before experimenting on their own.\n\nBeing capable of experiencing any state of consciousness already discovered\nand understood will hopefully also turn out to be economically desirable. In\norder to be of relevance in the market of information about the state-space of\nconsciousness you yourself will need to be an explorer and be up to date with\nwhat is in vogue. This opens up the possibility of a full-fledged qualia\neconomy: when people have spare resources and are interested in new states of\nconsciousness, anyone good at mining the state-space for precious gems will\nhave an economic advantage.\n\nIn principle the whole economy may eventually be entirely based on exploring\nthe state-space of consciousness and trading information about the most\nvaluable contents discovered doing so. The traits 4 through 7 are intended to\naddress the complications that arise from the need to have social competence\nto survive in such an economy.\n\nSociety may ultimately converge into a system in which people are constantly\nin hyper-valuable states and the only way to become powerful is to invent new\nways to improve upon the already highly-optimal state-spaces people are free\nto roam all the time. In this economy, people would also be motivated to help\nothers succeed: Everyone benefits from making discoveries since every\ndiscovered state is made accessible to everyone.\n\nHow could we implement a conscious mind with these attributes? The task is\nindeed extremely demanding, and billions of dollars in R&D will have to be\ninvested before we have a silver-bullet genetic intervention that takes us in\nthat direction. In the next centuries we are likely to see hundreds of\nthousands of researchers experimenting with various cocktails, implants and\ngenetic vectors hacking themselves in order to reliably improve their hedonic\ntone while also increasing their economic value.\n\nIn order to have any chance at living in such a society we need to make sure\nwe won\u2019t be overrun by pure replicators in any of their gazillion different\nguises. To do so, we need to make sure we do not fall prey to any of the\nwireheading mistakes outlined above. And we also need to make sure that we can\ngive back to the world more than we take, so that the world is happy to have\nus around.\n\n## Wireheading Done Right: Stay Positive Without Going Insane\n\nTo remain economically relevant and subvert the rise of pure replicators, it\nis quintessential that one\u2019s capacity to explore the state-space of\nconsciousness is a marketable skill. Your imagination (if we choose to call it\nthat way), should therefore work at an acceptable depth and pace from the\npoint of view of the current economy of social relationships.\n\nBe like my friends Leona and Link. They have a balanced routine of many\nvarieties of experiential wellbeing and euphoria. They are hyper-motivated in\nthe morning (fast euphoria), go crazy creative and spiritual in the afternoon\n(spiritual euphoria), and go to sleep in delightful oceans of cool sensations\n(slow euphoria). They are genetically engineered to live the good life without\ngetting stuck in bad loops.\n\nThe diagram above illustrates the main idea: we want to rewire our reward\narchitecture in such a way that as each kind of euphoria is instantiated a\ndifferent one becomes more accessible.\n\nFor example, we may want to wirehead ourselves in such a way that our ability\nto experience fast euphoria is gated by slow euphoria. Until you have not\n\u201csatiated\u201d your psychological need for resting you will not be allowed to feel\nhyper-motivated. Our desires are already state-specific, but the current\nnetwork of transition probabilities between emotions facilitates the\nreinforcement of toxic local attractors (also called \u201cdeath spirals\u201d like\nstates of depression or generalized anxiety). By re-engineering the network of\ntransition probabilities between emotions and extracting out the dysphoric\ncomponents we might be able to guarantee a continuous flow between\nfunctionally and phenomenologically distinct modes of wellbeing. Wireheading\ndone right consists of having wonderful experiences all the time, but in such\na way that you never feel compelled to stay where you are for too long. In\naddition, a good wireheading procedure should also allow you to keep learning\nuseful information about the state-space of consciousness. Wireheading should\nnot imply the end of learning. In brief, we suggest that we should change our\nbrains so that by feeling great in a certain way you temporarily reduce the\nresponse to that particular kind of euphoria but also make it easier to enjoy\nsome other kind. One would thus be incentivized to keep moving, and to never\ngive up or to get stuck in loops.\n\nNaturally one may be skeptical that perpetual (but varied) bliss is at all\npossible. After all, shouldn\u2019t we be already there if such states were\nactually evolutionarily advantageous? The problem is that the high-valence\nstates we can experience evolved to increase our inclusive fitness in the\nancestral environment, and not in an economy based on gradients of bliss.\nExperiences are calorically expensive; in the African Savannah it may cost too\nmany calories to keep people in novelty-producing hyperthymic states (even if\none is kept psychologically balanced) relative to the potential benefits of\nhaving our brains working at the minimal acceptable capacity. In today\u2019s\nenvironment we have a surplus of calories which can be put to good use, i.e.\nto explore the state-space of consciousness and have a chance at discovering\nsocially (and hedonically) valuable states. Exploring consciousness may thus\nnot only be aligned with real value (cf. valence realism) but it might also\nturn out to be a good, rational time investment if you live in an experience-\noriented economy. We are not particularly calorie-constrained nowadays; our\nstates of consciousness should be enriched to reflect this fact.\n\nLink and Leona (whom you may recognize from a previous article) are two\nsuccessful wireheads who are now happier than ever. They chose to have the\nfollowing feedback network for their valence: fast makes it easier to feel\nspiritual, spiritual makes it easier to feel slow, and slow makes it easier to\nfeel fast. Their primary state of consciousness cycles over a period of 24\nhours. Here is their routine: They wake up and experience intense zest for\nlife and work at full capacity making others happy and having fun. Then they\ngo crazy creative in the afternoon, usually spending that time alone or with\nfriends, and explore (and share) strange but always awesome psychedelic-like\nstates of consciousness. Finally, at night they just relax to the max (the\nhealthy and genetically encoded phenomenological equivalent of shooting\nheroin). They report having more agency than before, since now they feel that\nthere is time to do everything they want, and moving from one activity to the\nnext is easy and spontaneous. This kind of wireheading allows them to avoid\nloops, drops in motivation or impoverished creativity and introspection. The\nonly thing they had to accept was that \u201chey, you don\u2019t need to have all of the\neuphorias at once all the time\u201d. By enjoying them one at a time you can\nguarantee a healthy mind, a healthy social life and a healthy economic output.\n\n## Positive Wireheading at the Evolutionary Limit\n\nOne of the main insights of evolutionary game theory is that strategies that\nhave the best shot at being dominant for long periods of time have three\nproperties: (1) they do well on average against other strong strategies, (2)\ndo well against themselves, and (3) have an immune system against custom anti-\nstrategies. This last condition may be skipped if we are not going to play for\ntoo long, but in the long run it is absolutely necessary. Custom anti-\nstrategies may themselves be terrible against other strong strategies and even\nagainst themselves, so you may not realize they exist at first. For a while\nyour strategy may be dominating the space with no signs of anything changing.\nBut then you may start noticing that a tiny population of contrarians are\nbeginning to grow exponentially. In no time you are defeated and the world\nbreaks into chaos (since the contrarians may not be good at holding power). A\nclassical illustration of this phenomenon comes from the evolutionary setup of\nthe Iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. Here we can find some strategies that satisfy\n(1) and (2) but do not have a good immune system against free-loading\nstrategies. The strategy always-defect is surprisingly effective in an\necosystem dominated by always-cooperate. Likewise the Pavlov strategy can\nexploit the vulnerabilities of tit-for-tat-with-forgiveness, (though improved\nversions can counter it). Over time we see sporadical population booms and\nbusts caused by cycles of cooperative eras collapsing under parasitic\nbreakthroughs.\n\nI posit that an ecology of wirehead minds that dedicate themselves to explore\n(\u201cmine\u201d) the state-space of consciousness can be economically powerful if\nother people are willing to pay for the information about how to instantiate\nthe high-valence qualia discovered during these explorations. A large group of\ncooperators that help each other explore the state-space of consciousness\nsatisfies condition (2) from the previous paragraph. But in order to satisfy\ncondition (1) we need an environment in which knowledge about consciousness is\nmarketable. The Super-Shulgin Academies (i.e. rational psychonautic\ncollectives) of the future may concentrate all the qualia research talent in\nthe world and reap the highest economic benefits while producing the largest\namount of value, but they will only be able to do so if the surrounding\nsociety values their output. A society of pure replicators has no use for\nSuper-Shulgin Academies, let alone Manhattan Projects of Consciousness (i.e.\nglobal concerted efforts to find and recruit benevolence-enhancing states of\nconsciousness). But given the moral and hedonistic pursuits of our fellow\nhumans we may still have a chance: making people happier than they currently\nare is a trillion-dollar industry nowadays, and Super-Shulgin Academies may\ncapitalize on this demand by selling valence-enhancing technologies to the\nmasses.\n\nWith regards to (3) we may happen to be lucky this time: Knowing all there is\nto know about the state-space of consciousness is the best way to prevent\noneself from being outsmarted. Super-Shulgin Academies would invest heavily in\nresearching ways to defend themselves against pure replicators. As part of its\nimmune system, a Super-Shulgin Academy should only admit benevolent\nindividuals as researchers. Benevolence, perhaps, is best implemented at the\nlevel of ontological qualia: someone who believes that we are all the same\nconsciousness is a lot less dangerous to others than someone who is\nsolipsistic or self-centered. \u201cTechnology is destructive only in the hands of\npeople who do not realize they are one and the same process as the universe.\u201d\n(Alan Watts). Rational agency and super-sentience in the hands of Open\nIndividualists (i.e. people who believe that we are all the same subject of\nexperience) could eventually allow us to bring about a good qualia and\nvalence-centric Singleton.\n\nBut to bootstrap our way there we need to make sure that the organization\nwould not die out even in an economy that isn\u2019t already completely focused on\nconsciousness (i.e. to fulfill condition 1).\n\nWe are very lucky to live in the Age of Spandrels. We take for granted the\nfact that people around us like to watch movies, go to sports events, read\nnovels, get drunk, listen to music, have sex, etc. without realizing they\ncould be investing all of that energy in figuring out how to make clones. We\ndon\u2019t usually realize that people\u2019s atavistic inefficient hedonism is in fact\nour saving grace. (As an aside, I hope I am not inspiring anyone to go wild\ninto the arts and do silly non-optimal things. My readership is capable of\nmuch more than that. Let us do silly non-optimal things in the most optimal\nway possible, by which I mean, let\u2019s try to ensure that future beings care\nabout valence and consciousness.) We should be thankful that we still have\nresidual sexually-selected preferences for experientially rich lifestyles over\npure and efficient dullness.\n\nWiki-consciousness. The state-space of consciousness library is accessible to\neveryone free of charge.\n\nAs long as we make intelligent use of today\u2019s collective interest in exploring\nconsciousness (in all of its guises e.g. art, philosophy, drugs) we still have\na chance to create a sustainable economy of well-rounded wireheads that is\nworth living. The wirehead psychonaut collective would obtain most of its\neconomic power via the revenue coming from the discoveries made during the\nsystematic exploration of the state-space of consciousness. If the public\nconsumes these discoveries, then the strategy may be perfectly self-\nsustaining. The process itself would be beneficial, as we would discover new\nways to make people happy, bring the radical freedom to inhabit any known\nstate of consciousness and increase our understanding of the universe.\n\nOne can even imagine that if Super-Shulgin Academies become the most powerful\neconomic forces in the world, they may choose to create a massive \u201cwiki-\nconsciousness\u201d: a library of all known states of consciousness completely\naccessible to anyone free of charge. Why would they do this given that their\npower comes from being able to sell this information? On the one hand it\nstabilizes people\u2019s ability to gain power over each other (since the only way\nto gain power in such an economy is to sell information about the state-\nspace). This incentivizes people to actually find something new and valuable\nfor everyone if they are aiming to become more powerful. And on the other\nhand, making the information freely available would also increase the quality\nof prospective members of the psychonaut collective due to widespread\nconsciousness literacy.\n\nIf we play our cards right we may still have a chance of avoiding the pure\nreplicators, Molochs and Singletons that lurk ahead in our forward light-cone.\nBut to do so we need to stay grounded and avoid the pitfalls here discussed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf we are to have a chance at surviving with a good quality of life in the\nsundown of the Age of Spandrels we will need to preemptively outcompete pure\nreplicators. To do so we must avoid wireheading traps and take seriously\nfuture economic selection pressures, as they will determine who or what\nsurvives at the evolutionary limit. It is imperative that we take advantage of\nthe current collective demand for valence and information about consciousness\nto fund ambitious consciousness research programs. Such programs will\ncapitalize on this demand and kick-start a valence-centric market. In turn,\nscientific breakthroughs in this area may increase the percentage of the\neconomy that is dedicated to exploring consciousness, which may reduce the\nopportunities for pure replicators to participate in the economy.\n\nWe need to act fast: if the economic demand for valence technologies\ndisappears (or is low enough), we will find ourselves in a world in which\nexploring the state-space of consciousness is not profitable and pure\nreplicators win.\n\n* Thanks to Chris Potts for putting the papers online.\n\n** I owe this theoretical framework to Mike Johnson and his magnificent work\non the nature of valence: Principia Qualia.\n\n*** Tragedy of the commons (i.e. failure of cooperation).\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * More\n\n  * Email\n  * Reddit\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\ndrugs evolution intelligence mind philosophy\n\n## 54 comments\n\n  1.
