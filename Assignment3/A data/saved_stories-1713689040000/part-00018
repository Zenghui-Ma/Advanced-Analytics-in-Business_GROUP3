They\u2019re\nkilling ours instead.\n\n2.2KLikes\n\n31,082Views\n\nApr 202024\n\nAmerican policymakers designed sanctions that were intended to deprive Chinese\ncompanies of cutting-edge chips, and the technology to make them. But they\nalso deprived chipmakers and chipmaking gear companies of its biggest markets\nof customers, which wiped out huge sources of revenue for our companies. And\nthey also pushed Chinese firms to develop their own semiconductor industry,\nout of necessity. Now they have. Chinese foundries are mass-producing chips\nthat not only sufficiently supply most of the Chinese markets, but are now\nexporting billions of chips annually, selling to global buyers at price points\nfar below US chipmakers' production costs.
