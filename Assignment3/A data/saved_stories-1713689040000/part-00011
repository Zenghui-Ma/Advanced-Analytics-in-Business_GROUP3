In\napplications that leverage RAG, vector search is commonly used as a way to\nretrieve relevant document chucks and other short-form text. The applicability\nof text-based RAG has led to widespread adoption, from single-person tech\nstartups to Fortune 500 fintech companies.\n\nAlthough primarily used for text today, vector search will be used extensively\nacross a variety of different modalities in the near future. This evolution is\nbeing powered by two independent occurrences: 1) the shift from large language\nmodels to large multimodal models, and 2) the rise in adoption for\n\"traditional\" tasks such as recommendation and semantic search. This library\naims to close the gap by providing an easy way to vectorize a variety of\ndifferent types of unstructured data.\n\nRadient currently includes models that vectorize the following modalities:\naudio, graph, image, molecule, text, and video. In some cases, the same\nvectorization method can be used across multiple modalities. This is known as\nmultimodal vectorization.\n\n### Getting started\n\nVectorization can be performed as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> from radient import text_vectorizer >>> vectorizer = text_vectorizer() >>> vectorizer.vectorize([\"Hello, world!\"]) [Vector([-3.21440510e-02, -5.10351397e-02, 3.69579718e-02, ...\n\nThe return class Vector is a subclass of np.ndarray, so you can easily perform\nmathematical operations such as cosine similarity:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> import numpy as np >>> vectors = vectorizer.vectorize([\"Hello, world!\", \"My name is Slim Shady.\"]) >>> np.dot(vectors[0], vectors[1]) 0.51627934\n\nSome vectorizers can be accelerated:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> vectorizer.vectorize([\"Hello, world!\"]) # runtime: ~32ms [Vector([-3.21440510e-02, -5.10351397e-02, 3.69579718e-02, >>> vectorizer.accelerate() >>> vectorizer.vectorize([\"Hello, world!\"]) # runtime: ~17ms [Vector([-3.21440622e-02, -5.10351285e-02, 3.69579904e-02, ...\n\nFor neural network vectorizers, this is typically done by exporting the model\nto ONNX, which essentically converts the model into a directed graph and\nperforms a series of optimizations (such as constant folding).\n\n### Coming soon TM\n\nA couple of features slated for the near-term (hopefully):\n\n  * Support for Huggingface's embedding model categories\n  * A preprocessing module that transforms the input data prior to vectorization\n  * Data extractors from S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc and readers for full end-to-end anydata ETL\n  * Vectorization-as-a-service using BentoML or some other similar framework\n\n## About\n\nRadient turns many data types - not just text - into vectors for similarity\nsearch.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n2 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
