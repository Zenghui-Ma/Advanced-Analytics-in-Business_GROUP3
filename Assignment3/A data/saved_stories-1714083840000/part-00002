Brent Lewin\u2014Getty Images\n\nIdeas\n\nBy Debasish Roy Chowdhury\n\nApril 24, 2024 4:00 AM EDT\n\nDebasish Roy Chowdhury is the co-author of To Kill A Democracy: India\u2019s\nPassage to Despotism\n\nThe International Monetary Fund issued a most unusual rebuttal this month. Its\nspokeswoman Julie Kozack told reporters in Washington that executive director\nKrishnamurthy Subramanian\u2019s growth forecast of 8% for India did not represent\nthe views of the IMF, which still maintained a projection of 6.5% for the\ncountry.\n\nSubramanian\u2019s views\u2014expressed at an event in New Delhi a few days earlier\u2014were\nin his role as India\u2019s representative at the IMF, she said. The \u201cexecutive\ndirector\u201d is actually one of the 24 such directors elected by member countries\nto the IMF\u2019s \u201cexecutive board,\u201d which, confusingly enough, is \u201cdistinct from\nthe work of the IMF staff.\u201d Just how distinct became clear when Subramanian\ntrashed IMF staff on X in response, saying the institution\u2019s GDP forecasts for\nIndia are \u201cconsistently INACCURATE.\u201d\n\nAs a former chief economic adviser to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and\ndelegated to the IMF by the Modi government, Subramanian has good reason to\ntake umbrage at the slightest suggestion that India\u2019s economy may not be as\nrobust as thought. The narrative of India as the new economic miracle is\nfoundational to both the personality cult of Modi and the legitimacy of his\ngovernment at home and abroad.\n\nModi rode to power in 2014 on the promise of mending a faltering economy. As\nchief minister of the western state of Gujarat, he had built up a formidable\nreputation as an efficient business-friendly administrator, which he\nsuccessfully leveraged in his bid for the nation\u2019s top job. \u201cAchhe din,\u201d or\n\u201cgood times,\u201d was his promise.\n\nLooking at the economic news coming out of India these days, it would seem he\nhas delivered. As the fastest growing major economy, India is considered \u201cthe\nshining star of the global economy,\u201d as the S&P Global Ratings chief economist\ncalls it. It has already surpassed the U.K. to become the world\u2019s fifth\nlargest economy and is expected to overtake Japan and Germany to become the\nthird-largest in five years. The Indian stock market, now the world\u2019s fourth\nlargest, is at an all-time high.\n\nAs India goes to polls, data points like these help megaphone Modi\u2019s narrative\nof the country\u2019s makeover into an economic powerhouse on his watch. At home,\nthey amplify his image as a steady hand on the tiller taking India to ever\ngreater heights. Abroad, they help mute criticism of his Hindu supremacist\ndispensation\u2019s systematic attacks on India\u2019s secular democracy and its Muslim\nand Christian minorities.\n\nRead More: India\u2019s Ayodhya Temple Is a Huge Monument to Hindu Supremacy\n\nTo be sure, the Indian economy\u2019s size today and the scope of development makes\nit one of the most interesting growth stories. And, Big Business has much to\nbe thankful for Modi\u2019s reign. There\u2019s less red tape and more administrative\nfocus and push for industry. The government\u2019s policy of incentivizing\nbusinesses with subsidies and tax breaks, and helping major homegrown firms to\nbecome \u201cnational champions\u201d works well for them.\n\nYet the perception of India\u2019s supposed economic miracle is also a product of a\ntightly controlled information ecosystem in which data is managed in keeping\nwith the government\u2019s narrative, ably assisted by a regime-friendly media. The\nsimplest statistical fact is that Modi\u2019s second term has actually seen the\nlowest period of GDP growth since India liberalized its markets in the early\n1990s. Per capita income over the past 10 years grew half as fast as the\ndecade under Modi\u2019s predecessor Manmohan Singh of the opposition Congress\nParty, while stock market returns are lower than in the previous decade.\n\nMuch of the positive changes attributed to Modi, such as digitization of the\neconomy and improved tax collection are a continuation of past trends,\npolicies, and technological advancement. And much of the hype over the overall\nstate of the economy does not wash when you drill down the numbers.\n\n### More From TIME\n\nEven Modi\u2019s former economic aides find the recent growth rates of 8% announced\nby the government \u201cmystifying.\u201d Major discrepancies in the way GDP is being\ncalculated make the data hugely problematic. One of Modi\u2019s former chief\neconomists holds that if correctly measured, India\u2019s economy would actually be\nfound to be decelerating.\n\nMeanwhile, foreign direct investment is plunging. FDI levels are now the\nlowest in nearly two decades. Even local investors are shying away from\nopening their wallets. Private capital expenditure remains low. Private sector\ninvestment has in fact been falling as a proportion of GDP since 2012 and the\neconomy is now largely driven by huge government investment.\n\nThe consumer goods market continues to be sluggish, with people cutting down\non staples\u2014emblematic of economic stress. Private consumption growth is the\nslowest in 20 years, setting aside the pandemic low. Tractor sales, a proxy\nfor the economic health of villages (where 70% of Indians live), have fallen\nsteeply. Banks are battling the worst deposit crunch in two decades as\nhousehold savings are at a 47-year low while household debt levels are at a\nrecord high. Not exactly the signs of a booming economy. In the last financial\nyear, India\u2019s goods exports fell 3% and its crude imports, 14%.\n\nUnemployment is also endemic. The share of young people with secondary or\nhigher education among unemployed youth has almost doubled in 20 years; a\nthird of graduates are unemployed. Jobless Indian youth now pursue\nopportunities in conflict zones in Israel and Ukraine, and try to smuggle\nthemselves into the West. Indians are currently the third-largest group of\nundocumented immigrants in the U.S., their numbers having surged faster than\nthose from any other country.\n\nDespite all of Modi\u2019s drumbeating on boosting India\u2019s manufacturing sector\nwith his much-trumpeted \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign, manufacturing\u2019s share of the\nGDP has fallen. Far from increasing manufacturing jobs, India is losing them\nin millions. The ranks of farmworkers, meanwhile, have risen by 60 million in\nthe past four years. Agriculture now actually employs a greater share of\nworkers than it did five years ago, a reversal that points to\ndeindustrialization.\n\nThere are also concerns about data manipulation. Before the last parliamentary\nelection in 2019, the government buried its own employment data before the\nelection as it showed the unemployment rate to be at a 45-year-high, leading\nto resignations of members of the National Statistical Commission. A key five-\nyearly consumer survey result was withheld that year because of \u201cdata quality\nissues.\u201d When it was finally released this February, it showed poverty and\ninequality has fallen, and consumer spending had tripled in a decade. That\ncontradicts the government\u2019s own findings and data found elsewhere.\n\nBy some estimates, around 1 million people referred to as the \u201coctopus class\u201d\nnow control 80% of the country\u2019s wealth and are creating an illusion of\nnational prosperity. The latest \u201cWorld Inequality Report\u201d calls India a\n\u201cBillionaire Raj\u201d where income inequality is now worse than under British\nrule. As the number of India\u2019s ultra-rich has grown 11 times in the last\ndecade, the country has fallen in the Global Hunger Index, and now sits below\nNorth Korea and war-torn Sudan. Acknowledging the issue, Modi\u2019s government is\ngiving free grains to 60% of the population.\n\nNone of these facts speak to the El Dorado that Modi is claiming to be\ncreating. India needs much more than headline management and upward mobility\nfor a tiny segment to fundamentally transform its economy. Apart from heavy\ninvestment in physical infrastructure\u2014which Modi can be duly credited for\u2014his\ngovernment isn\u2019t doing much else for that transformation.\n\nAll Asian economies that have sparkled in the past half-century have seen\nheavy synchronization between their trade, industrial, and social policies.\nLand reforms, enormous state intervention in education and health, and other\nredistributive policies created the bedrock of domestic demand and higher\nproductivity that spurred Asia\u2019s \u201cmiracle\u201d countries. These are the reasons\nwhy Vietnam, seen as the new Asian miracle, exports more than India with less\nthan a tenth of India\u2019s population. Modi has done little to suggest he has the\ninclination or the ability for such deep reforms to make India shine. A false\ngold rush is all he can offer.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * Coco Gauff Is Playing for Herself Now\n  * Scenes From Pro-Palestinian Encampments Across U.S. Universities\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * If You're Dating Right Now , You're Brave: Column\n  * The AI That Could Heal a Divided Internet\n  * Fallout Is a Brilliant Model for the Future of Video Game Adaptations\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
