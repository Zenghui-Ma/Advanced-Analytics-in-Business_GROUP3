Police\nsay Darien used AI voice synthesis software to simulate Eiswert's voice,\nleading the public to believe the principal made racist and antisemitic\ncomments.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new AI can simulate anyone\u2019s voice with 3 seconds of audio\n\nThe audio clip, posted on a popular Instagram account, contained offensive\nremarks about \"ungrateful Black kids\" and their academic performance, as well\nas a threat to \"join the other side\" if the speaker received one more\ncomplaint from \"one more Jew in this community.\" The recording also mentioned\nnames of staff members, including Darien's nickname \"DJ,\" suggesting they\nshould not have been hired or should be removed \"one way or another.\"\n\nThe comments led to significant uproar from students, faculty, and the wider\ncommunity, many of whom initially believed the principal had actually made the\ncomments. A Pikesville High School teacher named Shaena Ravenell reportedly\nplayed a large role in disseminating the audio. While she has not been\ncharged, police indicated that she forwarded the controversial email to a\nstudent known for their ability to quickly spread information through social\nmedia. This student then escalated the audio's reach, which included sharing\nit with the media and the NAACP.\n\nBaltimore County Police say that Darien had accessed school networks to search\nfor and utilize AI tools capable of voice imitation. Police also linked Darien\nto an email account used to distribute the fake recordings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice-cloning technology, which we have covered in the past, can generate\nrealistic speech after being trained on millions of human voices, then tuned\nto match a specific voice in a provided sample. In March, Baltimore Banner\nreporters spoke with Siwei Lyu, the director of a media forensics lab at the\nUniversity at Buffalo. Lyu told the newspaper that he believed the falsified\nclip of Eiswert speaking was created using a voice synthesis service such as\nElevenLabs. ElevenLabs allows users to upload voice samples of people for\ncloning using text-to-speech synthesis, although its terms of service prohibit\ncloning a voice without the person's permission.\n\nThe incident led to Eiswert being absent from the school since the\ninvestigation began, and he has denied making the comments, stating that they\ndo not align with his views. \"I did not make this statement, and these\nthoughts are not what I believe in as both an educator and a person,\" Eiswert\nsaid in a written statement.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nOpenAI holds back wide release of voice-cloning tech due to misuse concerns\n\nWhen the audio clip emerged in January, Superintendent Myriam Rogers called\nthe comments \"disturbing\" and \"highly offensive and inappropriate.\" The\nBaltimore Banner notes that Billy Burke, head of the union representing\nEiswert, was the only official to publicly suggest the audio was AI-generated.\nHe expressed disappointment in the public's assumption of Eiswert's guilt and\nrevealed that the principal and his family had been harassed and threatened,\nrequiring police presence at their home.\n\nThis isn't the first time that AI voice-cloning software has caused trouble.\nWe've previously covered phone scams where someone imitates a loved one's\nvoice (in an attempt to trick people into giving them money) and election\ncampaign robocalls that use cloned voices of famous politicians like Joe\nBiden. In March, OpenAI revealed the existence of its own voice-cloning\ntechnology, but the company said it was holding it back for now due to misuse\nconcerns.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n82\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
