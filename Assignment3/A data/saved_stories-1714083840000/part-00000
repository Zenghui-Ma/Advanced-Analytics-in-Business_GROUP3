Citizen agents wander the grid randomly, and are endowed\nwith individual risk aversion and hardship levels; there is also a universal\nregime legitimacy value. There are also Cop agents, who work on behalf of the\nregime. Cops arrest Citizens who are actively rebelling; Citizens decide\nwhether to rebel based on their hardship and the regime legitimacy, and their\nperceived probability of arrest.\n\nThe model generates mass uprising as self-reinforcing processes: if enough\nagents are rebelling, the probability of any individual agent being arrested\nis reduced, making more agents more likely to join the uprising. However, the\nmore rebelling Citizens the Cops arrest, the less likely additional agents\nbecome to join.\n\n## How to Run\n\nTo run the model interactively, run EpsteinCivilViolenceServer.py in this\ndirectory. e.g.\n\n    \n    \n    $ python EpsteinCivilViolenceServer.py\n\nThen open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8521/ and press Reset, then Run.\n\n## Files\n\n  * EpsteinCivilViolence.py: Core model and agent code.\n  * EpsteinCivilViolenceServer.py: Sets up the interactive visualization.\n  * Epstein Civil Violence.ipynb: Jupyter notebook conducting some preliminary analysis of the model.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nThis model is based adapted from:\n\nEpstein, J. \u201cModeling civil violence: An agent-based computational approach\u201d,\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Vol. 99, Suppl. 3, May 14,\n2002\n\nA similar model is also included with NetLogo:\n\nWilensky, U.
