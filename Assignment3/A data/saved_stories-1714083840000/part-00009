The\nright to repair is seen as a key step for the EU\u2019s plan to achieve a circular\neconomy by 2050 as part of the European Green Deal, the EU\u2019s roadmap to reach\nclimate neutrality by 2050.\n\nIn April 2024, the Parliament adopted the directive on the right to repair\nthat aims to encourage more sustainable consumption by making it easier to\nrepair defective goods, reducing waste and supporting the repair sector.\n\nRen\u00e9 Repasi, the German S&D member in charge of steering the legislation\nthrough Parliament, said: \u201cConsumers\u2019 right to repair products will now become\na reality. It will be easier and cheaper to repair instead of purchase new,\nexpensive items. This is a significant achievement for Parliament and its\ncommitment to empower consumers in the fight against climate change.\u201d\n\n> It will be easier and cheaper to repair instead of purchase new, expensive\n> items.\n\nRen\u00e9 Repasi (S&D, Germany)\n\nMEP in charge of steering the right to repair legislation through Parliament\n\n## Four reasons for the right to repair legislation\n\n  * According to a 2020 Eurobarometer survey, 77% of EU consumers would rather repair their goods than buy new ones, but ultimately have to replace or discard them because of the cost of repairs and lack of service provided.\n\n  * Another obstacle to a more sustainable consumption is obsolescence: some products are designed to fail after a certain time or amount of use. In some cases, the components of the devices are fixed in such a way that they cannot be taken out and replaced.\n\n  * Repairs of electronic devices would be good for the environment, leading to a reduction in resource use, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and less energy consumption.\n\n  * Electronics are the fastest growing source of waste in the EU, but much of it is stil not being recycled.\n\n  * Check out our infographic for e-waste facts and figures\n\n## What is the right to repair legislation about?\n\nParliament has been in favour of improving consumers\u2019 right to repair for more\nthan a decade and has made a number of concrete proposals to the European\nCommission to make repairs systematic, cost-efficient and attractive.\n\nAs recently as April 2022, Parliament called for a legislative proposal from\nthe Commission for a right to repair covering long-lasting products that can\nbe fixed. The Commission put forward a proposal in March 2023.\n\nThe new legislation aims to make repairs more attractive and available for\nconsumers:\n\n  * Sellers will be required to prioritise repair within the legal guarantee period if it is cheaper or equal in cost to replacing a good. The legal guarantee will be extended by one year once a product has been fixed\n  * Consumers will have the right to request repairs for products such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners and smartphones after the guarantee has expired. The list of product categories eligible for repair can be extended over time.\n  * Replacement devices should be offered on loan for the duration of the repair. If a device proves irreparable, consumers may opt for a refurbished unit as an alternative.\n  * A European online platform with national sections will be set up to help consumers find local repairers in their area\n  * Consumers will be offered incentives to repair products rather than replace them with new ones\n  * Consumers should be offered harmonised set of information details regarding the reparability of devices so that they can assess and compare repair services\n\nThe directive complements other new EU rules on ecodesign, marking a shift\ntoward a more consumer-friendly and environmentally conscious approach.\n\n## Next steps\n\nFollowing the Parliament's approval, once the Council endorses it, the\ndirective will be published in the EU Official Journal. EU countries will then\nhave 24 months to transpose it into their national laws.\n\n## More on what Europe does to achieve a circular economy\n\n  * # Stopping greenwashing: how the EU regulates green claims\n\n  * Proposals to promote sustainable consumption\n  * How to reduce plastic waste: EU strategy explained\n  * Benefits of a circular economy\n  * Ecodesign rules for sustainable products on EU market\n\n## Right to repair\n\n  * Briefing (November 2023)\n  * Check legislative progress\n  * (open in a new tab) Audiovisual materials\n  * (open in a new tab) Press conference by Ren\u00e9 Repasi (April 2024)\n\n## Share this article on:\n\n  * Share this page on Facebook\n  * Share this page on Twitter\n  * Share this page on LinkedIn\n  * Share this page on WhatsApp\n\n  * Sign up for mail updates\n  * PDF version\n\n## Topics\n\n### Parliament in your country\n\n  * Open in a new page London\n  * Open in a new page Dublin\n  * Open in a new page Edinburgh\n  * Open in a new page Valletta\n  * Open in a new page Washington\n\n### Tools\n\n  * Open in a new page Legislative Observatory\n  * Multimedia Centre\n  * Open in a new page EbS\n\n### The President of the European Parliament\n\n  * Open in a new page European Parliament President\u2019s website\n\n## European Parliament\n\n  * News\n  * Topics\n  * MEPs\n  * About Parliament\n  * Plenary\n  * Committees\n  * Delegations\n  * Elections\n\n## The Parliament on social media\n\n  * Check out Parliament on Facebook\n  * Check out Parliament on Twitter\n  * Check out Parliament on Flickr\n  * Check out Parliament on LinkedIn\n  * Check out Parliament on YouTube\n  * Check out Parliament on Instagram\n  * Check out Parliament on Pinterest\n  * Check out Parliament on Snapchat\n  * Check out Parliament on Reddit\n\n## Information links\n\n  * Contact\n  * RSS\n  * Sitemap\n  * Legal notice\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Accessibility\n\n", "frontpage": false}
