Given how aggressively the CIA went after former officer Frank\nSnepp for telling tales out of school, one wonders why former CIA analysts Ray\nMcGovern and Larry Johnson are able to be pretty open about the less than\nsavory things they saw back in their days. Johnson in particular has\nrepeatedly described how the CIA engages in psy-ops via planting press\nstories. Is it that they\u2019ve never presented enough specifics to amount to\nenough of an attack surface?\n\nRegardless, Tom Neuburger is staring a long, historically-rooted look at what\nthe Agency has been found to be up to.\n\nBy Thomas Neuburger. Originally published at God\u2019s Spies\n\n> \u201cDeception is a state of mind and the mind of the state.\u201d \u2014James Angleton,\n> CIA counterintelligence chief, 1954-1975\n\nAs I mentioned here, I want to start looking at the CIA and its role both in\nAmerican life and American politics. Through this series I\u2019ll be drawing from\nmany sources, familiar and unfamiliar, some respected by most, and some hated\nby partisan voices.\n\nIn all cases, I\u2019ll focus on just two things: what\u2019s known, and what seems\nlikely based on what\u2019s known.\n\n### Whistleblower Frank Snepp on CIA Propaganda\n\nLet\u2019s start here with a taste. Edward Snowden is familiar to many and\nrespected by most of those. (His forced residence in Russia makes some people\npause.)\n\nThe admission in this 1983 video is striking:\n\n> Do you think the CIA still does this? https://t.co/ZBydxoWs2h\n>\n> \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) April 7, 2024\n\nThe man being interviewed is Frank Snepp, a former CIA employee during the\nVietnam War era. The full video is here:\n\nAbout Frank Snepp, the YouTube poster (Witness to War) wrote this:\n\n\u201cFrank Snepp arrived in Vietnam in 1969 and stayed on until he was evacuated\nas Saigon fell in 1975. He spent a good deal of time working with the press\nwhile there and developed the ability to plant stories in major media outlets\nlike the New York Times, the New Yorker, the LA Times, Chicago Daily News and\nothers that supported the Agency\u2019s goals. ... After he left the CIA he wrote a\nbook, Decent Interval, that talked about his time in Vietnam. The CIA made his\nlife hell and took a case all the way to the Supreme Court where they won a\nverdict that required Snepp to turn over all the money the book had made. That\nwas $300,000.\u201d\n\nAnd Wikipedia offers this:\n\n\u201cFrank Warren Snepp, III (born May 3, 1943) is a journalist and former chief\nanalyst of North Vietnamese strategy for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\nin Saigon during the Vietnam War. For five out of his eight years as a CIA\nofficer, he worked as interrogator, agent debriefer, and chief strategy\nanalyst in the United States Embassy, Saigon; he was awarded the Intelligence\nMedal of Merit for his work. Snepp is a former producer for KNBC-TV in Los\nAngeles, California. He was one of the first whistle blowers who revealed the\ninner workings, secrets and failures of the national security services in the\n1970s. As a result of a loss in a 1980 court case brought by the CIA, all of\nSnepp\u2019s publications require prior approval by the CIA.\u201d\n\nSo, not a nobody.\n\nSnowden\u2019s Question\n\nNow consider Snowden\u2019s question: Do you think the CIA still does this?\n\nI would answer:\n\n  * Is it certain? Not from this evidence, though stay tuned for more.\n  * Is it likely? Of course it is. Why would they stop?\n\n### CIA Assassination Manual, Contra Edition\n\nThe CIA has authored a number of counter-insurgency and assassination manuals.\nOne was leaked during the 1984 presidential campaign. An editorial by the\nWashington Post characterizes the manual as \u201cadvising Nicaraguan guerrillas\nhow to kidnap, assassinate, blackmail and dupe civilians [which] is an\nappalling production\u201d. It dismisses the document as a \u201clame-brained idea\nlaunched on the political side of the government\u201d and hopes that Reagan will\ninvestigate quickly.\n\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo answers questions at the Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies in Washington in 2017. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nHere\u2019s that \u201clame-brained idea,\u201d the manual itself, titled Psychological\nOperations in Guerrilla Warfare. From the section \u201cArmed Propaganda\u201d:\n\n> 5\\. Selective Use of Violence for Propagandistic Effects\n>\n> It is possible to neutralize carefully selected and planned targets, such as\n> court judges, mesta judges, police and State Security officials, CDS chiefs,\n> etc. [...]\n>\n> The target or person should be chosen on the basis of:\n>\n>   * The spontaneous hostility that the majority of the population feels\n> toward the target.\n>   * Use rejection or potential hatred by the majority of the population\n> affected toward the target, stirring up the population and making them see\n> all the negative and hostile actions of the individual against the people.\n>   * If the majority of the people give their support or backing to the\n> target or subject, do not try to change these sentiments through\n> provocation.\n>   * Relative difficulty of controlling the person who will replace the\n> target.\n>\n\n>\n> The person who will replace the target should be chosen carefully, based on:\n>\n>   * Degree of violence necessary to carry out the change.\n>   * Degree of violence acceptable to the population affected.\n>   * Degree of predictable reprisal by the enemy on the population affected\n> or other individuals in the area of the target.\n>\n\nElsewhere it recommends:\n\n\u201cSpecific tasks will be assigned to others, in order to create a \u201cmartyr\u201d for\nthe cause, taking the demonstrators to a confrontation with the authorities,\nin order to bring about uprisings or shootings, which will cause the death of\none or more persons, who would become the martyrs, a situation that should be\nmade use of immediately against the regime, in order to create greater\nconflicts.\u201d\n\nNote that this doesn\u2019t have to be done from the insurgents\u2019 standpoint. It can\nbe done by that state against insurgents, or mere demonstrators. The \u201cremoved\ntarget\u201d could be a deeply unpopular politician, for example. The \u201cmartyr\u201d\ncould be a policeman or some other official. These techniques would work well\nfrom either side of a CIA-involved conflict.\n\nSnowden\u2019s Question\n\nAgain we ask Snowden\u2019s question: Do you think the CIA still does this?\n\nI would answer:\n\n  * Is it certain? Yes. There\u2019s ample evidence that the CIA still murders abroad, still thinks murder is one of its options.\n  * Is it likely? Most definitely, if one looks overseas.\n\n### Today\u2019s CIA\n\nSet assassination aside for the moment. Does the CIA work to influence\ndomestic media, as it did during the Vietnam era? If so, what are its goals?\nDoes it run other domestic operations?\n\nMost people think the CIA doesn\u2019t operate here, given what they think is its\ncharter. And yet it does. To what extent is the CIA engaged inside U.S.\nborders? Future parts in this series will look at that.\n\nBottom line: To describe is not to condemn. Many people are glad our security\nstate is as \u201crobust\u201d as it is, given what people think are our various\nthreats.\n\nBut even they, I would think, would want to understand the kind of state we\nhave built.\n\nThis entry was posted in Guest Post, Media watch, Politics, Surveillance state\non April 25, 2024 by Yves Smith.\n\n##\n\nSubscribe to Post Comments\n\n36 comments\n\n  1.

Weiner\u2019s book Legacy of Ashes is very\ngood in my opinion. However, there is a difference between what I would\nconsider \u201cauthorized\u201d histories and those like Snepp\u2019s. Authors like Weiner,\nor Steve Coll, or Annie Jacobsen, who all have excellent inside sources and\nhave written best-selling books \u2013 and good ones \u2013 are all only as good as\ntheir sources allow. Meaning, in some sense they are all providing \u201climited\nhang-outs\u201d in a way, leaving out part of the story while providing great\n\u201cinside\u201d detail about the stories that are already known or no longer vital\nsecrets. To me, the test of such authors is (1) what do they *leave out* in\ntheir award-winning narratives; and (2) do they do anything in their careers\nlater on that would call into question their, um, \u201cobjectivity\u201d?\n\nRegarding the latter, for example: James Risen, Pulitzer Prize winning\njournalist who wrote very valuable exposes of the intelligence community\nduring the Bush years, all of the sudden starts writing ridiculous crap about\nRussiagate. Weiner, who wrote THE book on the CIA, is called on to smear\nOliver Stone for his Kennedy assassination documentary in a review that simply\naccepts the Warren Commission (which *no* one does today, even those who think\nOswald did it) and makes stuff up about Stone\u2019s sources. His authority as THE\nCIA expert gives him the cred to do so, though what he says is as\ntransparently flawed as what Risen said about Russiagate. Perhaps most\nfamously, Seymour Hersh, who of course had written many valuable exposes over\nthe years, including a crucial one of CIA activities in the 1970s, writes a\ncomplete hack-job smear of Kennedy in the 1990s based on CIA disinformation\nsources.\n\nMy assumption is that when they win Pulitzers and are celebrated in the\nmainstream press, they probably have not exposed anything too dangerous. When\nthey start getting smeared as \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d or threatened with prison\nor persecuted like Snepp and other whistle-blowers, then we should probably\nread especially closely. When Hersh all of the sudden was banished from the\nNew Yorker, and then from the London Review of Books, and then from\neverything, I figured his work on the Middle East must have been touching a\nnerve somewhere, and I started paying attention again.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n      1. barefoot charley April 25, 2024 at 11:48 am\n\nHersh\u2019s stories since his Nordstream scoop focus on what great work the CIA is\ndoing for humanity, most recently by convincing Israel that there are no nukes\nto blow up in Iran, so blow up fields in an army base like Iran did to you,\nand it\u2019s all good. Thanks, CIA! I hope all this currying favor will result in\nmeaningful scoops again one day.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n      2.

Trees&Trunks April 25, 2024 at 4:23 am\n\nA question: are we lied to a lot more now than previously? Due to age, I was\nbecoming aware of the lies during the full-scale, unprovoked and illegal US +\ncoalition of the willing invasion of Iraq. But there was some information\ngetting through about the lies so you could read it in the MSM too. But now,\nregarding Ukraine & Israel and just about everything else are only lies or\nseriously distorted nuggets of truth.\n\nWhat was life like for real in Libya? A North-Korea/Saddam Hussein like\nterror-state? What about the endless violence and chaos in Latin and South\nAmerica during the 70-90s?\n\nReply \u2193\n\n    1. timbers April 25, 2024 at 7:49 am\n\nWhen in high school/grade school, I was fascinated by books authored by former\ndiplomats/ambassadors/govt officials who wrote about the inner workings of\nevents throughout the world. They probably had to get content approved by from\nUncle Sam but interesting accounts and revealing details were still to be had,\nand it was accepted they had a right to \u201ccash in\u201d their careers via a book\nwith their knowledge so probably the CIA would tolerate some interesting\naccounts so they too could also when they retired. As long as USA was the Good\nGuy.\n\nI recall reading in one of these books, that the CIA or some US agency during\nthe Cold War had agents stationed at all the major \u201cnews\u201d outlets throughout\nEurope to ensure the correct news and narrative was published so USA could\ndefeat communism and be The Good Guy.\n\nFast forward and now everything is internet, it occurred to me at one point\nthe US control of narrative did not end with the fall of the Soviet Union but\nprobably increased dramatically given how these things work.\n\nPoint being, I knew as a kid in high school the Govt was involved in\ncontrolling and creating the \u201cnews\u201d but that seemed OK when I bought into the\nnarrative communism bad. Yet today, am amazed people of similar age frequently\ndon\u2019t know this and look at you like you\u2019re a Unique Artifact of Unusual\nUnconventional Opinions or Conspiracy Crazy for example my dentist is my age,\nand still knows nothing about what\u2019s happening in Ukraine/North Korea/whatever\nbeyond the Official MSM narrative.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how some people can through life that long, yet it never occurs\nto them the MSM \u201cnews\u201d they see is basically propaganda beyond the Red\nTeam/Blue Team construct.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n      1. lyman alpha blob April 25, 2024 at 10:23 am\n\nAs to T&T\u2019s question about whether we\u2019re lied to more now, I think it may just\nbe that we\u2019re able to suss out the lies quicker than in the past thanks to the\ninterwebs, which is why government s are trying so hard to crack down on what\ngets talked about on large platforms now. As I.F. Stone said so succinctly,\n\u201cAll governments lie.\u201d They always have and they always will.\n\nCouple things about your mention of the CIA during the Cold War, one from\nhistorical fiction and one real \u2013\n\nIn Don DeLillo\u2019s book Libra, which is a fictional account of the life of Lee\nHarvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination, there\u2019s a scene between one of\nthe main characters (can\u2019t remember if it was Oswald or not) and a spook,\nwhere the character questions the truth of a recent news event. The spook\ntells him what really happened and the character replies that he had just read\nthe opposite in the paper of record. The spook replies something to the effect\nof \u201cAnd who do you think planted that story in the paper?\u201d When I read that\nabout 30 years ago, I was naive enough to wonder whether that type of thing\nactually happened. Now that I have a little more historical knowledge under my\nbelt, it\u2019s clear that it does.\n\nThen there is the true story of \u201cDoc\u201d Humes, one of the founder\u2019s of the\nhighbrow magazine The Paris Review back in the 50s. He took too much acid at\nsome point in the 60s and wound up as some odd hobo/guru type wandering around\nIvy league campuses spouting conspiracy theories for the kiddies enjoyment,\namong them that he was being spied on by the government. PBS did a documentary\non him several years back, directed by his daughter \u2013\nhttps://www.pbs.org/independentlens/documentaries/doc/\n\nHumes wound up being the exemplar of the old adage \u201cJust because you\u2019re\nparanoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you\u201d. Turns out The Paris Review\nwas a CIA front and one of the co-founders, Peter Matthiessen, was in on it\nthe whole time. The other, George Plimpton, claims he only found out about it\nlater \u2013\nhttps://www.salon.com/2012/05/27/exclusive_the_paris_review_the_cold_war_and_the_cia/\nHumes was apparently out of the loop.\n\nIn the process of making the documentary on her father, Immy Humes filed a\nFOIA request. Turns out the US government had been spying on him for nearly 30\nyears, from 1948-1977. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_L._Humes\n\nReply \u2193\n\n      2. digi_owl April 25, 2024 at 12:14 pm\n\nRadio Free Europe is an European radio broadcaster set up by CIA back in the\nday.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n    2. hnd April 25, 2024 at 8:08 am\n\nWhat was life like in the Soviet Union?

In reading about Church I discovered that there\nwas also a House investigation at the same time lead by Representative Pike\n\nThis committee\u2019s report had been supressed by the CIA and the Ford\nAdministration so it\u2019s not too well known. Some excerpts were leaked to the\nVillage Voice in NY but I believe that the full report was published in the\nUK. I managed to purchase a copy and read it. Strangely enough the UK supplier\n(or USPS) shipped it to a Prof a Notre Dame, who sent it on to me.\n\nAnyway, I was reading it about 25 years after it would have been published and\nwhat finally struck me as significant was that CIA budget info. The report\nindicated that about half the funds went to covert ops and half went to\nplanting articles (paying reporters etc) around the world.\n\nInformation control had always been important.

Aurelien April 25, 2024 at 9:00 am\n\nThe article misses the larger point by concentrating on just the CIA, just\nattempts to influence the US media, and ropes in a forty-year old publication\nof dubious relevance to influencing public option.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to basics. All governments try to influence public opinion\nthrough affecting what appears in the media. One of the lessons you learn in\ngovernment is that if you don\u2019t control the understanding of a political\nissue, somebody else will. So whatever the topic, governments do their best to\nmake sure that the media coverage reflects their view of things and not\nsomebody else\u2019s.\n\nSometimes, this is extremely banal. At the launch of a new policy on\ntransport, education or whatever, specialist journalists will be invited to a\nbriefing, where the government will set out what it\u2019s intending to do, and\ndefend its decisions. Journalists can ask questions, and will write up the\nstory with phrase like \u201cofficials briefing the media said yesterday.\u201d A\npolitical figure will probably make statements on the record. The idea is to\nget the best press coverage possible.\n\nWhen the subject is more complex and controversial (say, major changes in\nhealth provision or new laws on immigration) the government will invite\nselected journalists that they hope will be reasonably sympathetic for an \u201coff\nthe record\u201d briefing by officials to put the government\u2019s case. Here, the\ndiscussion will be freer, and officials may say things that would not be said\nin public, but under rules of non-attribution. So journalists will attribute\nstatements to \u201cofficials speaking off the record\u201d or \u201cgovernment sources.\u201d\n(They will, of course, also speak to opposition politicians and opponents of\nthe various measures. Nothing says that the journalists you brief will allow\nyou to influence them, especially if there\u2019s a better story to be written by\nlistening to your opponents.)\n\nThen there\u2019s very private briefings, perhaps over lunch, for one or two\njournalists, maybe to try out ideas, or plant suggestions. So a government\nplanning to recognise Palestine as a state might convene one or two\njournalists for lunch with a senior diplomat. The deal in principle is\nprivileged information and an exclusive story in return for sympathetic\ncoverage, but of course there\u2019s no way of actually guaranteeing the latter. A\njournalist might then write a story saying \u201cInformed sources suggest privately\nthat the government is seriously considering recognising Palestine as a\nstate.\u201d\n\nThe involvement of intelligence agencies in all this, which happens every day,\neverywhere in the world, is very limited and usually happens for one of three\nreasons. One, largely but not entirely restricted to the US, is fighting\nbattles between different political leaders or departments. This is bad\npractice in a democracy, but unfortunately it does happen. The second is to\nget information into the public domain which can\u2019t be done through any of the\nstandard means. Most intelligence judgements are probabilistic, not absolute,\nwhich is why intelligence officers use words like \u201cassess\u201d and \u201cbelieve\u201d in\nwhat they write, and you can seldom guarantee that assessments are absolutely\ncorrect. And of course sources need to be protected: no journalist is ever\ngoing to be allowed to write \u201caccording to an undercover western source in the\nIranian President\u2019s office, the recent attack on Israel was ...etc.\u201d You\u2019ll\nget just \u201cintelligence sources believe that ...\u201d Sometimes, journalists act as\na cut-out for information that governments can\u2019t be formally associated with.\nFor example, suspicions about serious corruption in the Ukrainian leadership\nwould be politically embarrassing to mention publicly, especially if names\nwere named, but could be filtered through a cooperative journalist, maybe from\na foreign publication, and quoting \u201cstatements by government officials and\ninsiders in several countries.\u201d The third is what is sometimes called\n\u201cinformation operations,\u201d where particular claims or purported revelations are\npassed to the media with the specific intent of influencing public opinion or\ngovernments on a specific topic, as opposed to just getting a point of view\nacross. Such claims should ideally be true, or at least, represent a\ndefensible position: the more you get involved in misrepresentation or\ndeliberate lying the worse will be the consequences if you\u2019re found out.\n(There\u2019s no reason to believe that most reports on Ukraine attributed to\n\u201cintelligence sources\u201d are deliberate misdirection. It\u2019s fairly clear that\nthose involved believe this garbage.\u201d) I\u2019ve always been pretty dubious\npersonally about the value of this type of operation: it doesn\u2019t have much of\na record of success.\n\nThat said, of course, what people remember are scandals, and so quite rapidly\na discussion on this subject resolves itself into an argument about the\ninvasion of Iraq in 2003. But that\u2019s missing the point, I think. There\u2019s an\ninformation war going on, and fewer of the players are pure in heart (see some\nof the manipulative rubbish that NGOs turn out.) The real question is what\nrules should apply to elected governments in such cases.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n    1.

But that\u2019s missing the point, I think...\u201d\n\nAt one level, your description of the everyday behind-the-scenes processes of\n\u201cmedia influence\u201d rings true to my (definitely outsider) perception of that\nreality. It happens all the time; everyone does it; journalists are not always\ndupes; there are internal disagreements among those with power; managing\n\u201cpublic opinion\u201d has always been part of governing, etc. I have no reason to\ndisagree. And yet something is missing, I think. There is a reason we remember\nthe scandals, and those of us with a \u201cskeptical\u201d mindset tend to focus on\nthem. It is because the invasion of Iraq is not an *aberration*. Rather, it is\na model of what has *typically* occurred when there are major turning points\nin our foreign policy (and I can only speak of US history here). Either there\nis a consensus among \u201celites\u201d or an elite faction has captured the reins of\npower with a particular agenda. They mobilize resources to shape the narrative\nin the media. And *the media falls in line*. By now we are quite familiar with\nthe mechanisms by which this discipline is accomplished. Journalists who\nreinforce the narrative gain \u201cinsider\u201d access. Those who question it are cut\noff. Those who continue to question policy are smeared. Editors and publishers\nwho are not actual government assets (and we *know* some are) are controlled\nby various appeals to their interests, or the \u201cnational interest,\u201d etc. There\nis one dominant narrative about what is happening in... you name it. From Iran\nin 1953 through Vietnam in the 1960s (or even earlier) to Afghanistan, Iraq,\nLibya, Syria, or Ukraine in the 21st Century. The *media falls in line*\nwhenever a major policy decision is made. Or even a minor one, like Trump\u2019s\ndecision to fire missiles at Syria over the latter\u2019s supposed use of chemical\nweapons (when Trump finally became \u201cPresidential\u201d according to CNN!).\n\nWhen things go South (as they usually do), and internal elite disagreements\nover policy grow, *then* a few journalistic questions begin to trickle out in\nthe mainstream media. We hear almost nothing about Afghanistan for years, and\nall of the sudden \u201cThe Afghanistan Papers\u201d appear in the Washington Post! Yay\nmedia! Of course it simply reflects the fact that one faction of the\nEstablishment has decided that it\u2019s time to cut our losses. This is the\npattern that happens over and over again. Sometimes there is a mild media mea\nculpa (as with Iraq), but usually their complete propaganda-mongering is\nsimply memory holed. And we go on to the next campaign.\n\nI guess my reaction to your description here is similar to my reaction to\nreading Tim Weiner on the CIA (see above). It is accurate, but something is\nmissing for understanding how ideological management operates, especially in\nkey periods of agenda-setting.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n    3.

Rob Urie April 25, 2024 at 9:56 am\n\nWhile creation of a new Church Committee is fully supported here, it appears\nthat the CIA is more involved in domestic politics today than it was before\nthe Committee was formed.\n\nThis has bearing on the candidacy of Jill Stein, whose interview that appeared\nhere on NC would appeal to a huge audience if it were being viewed by a huge\naudience. As \u2018we\u2019 know from the Twitter files, the state has the power to\nlimit distribution.\n\nMost Americans appear to know little of the Five Eyes Alliance that emerged\nfrom WWII. It empowers the \u2018intelligence\u2019 agencies of the anglosphere to do\neach other\u2019s bidding when doing so is precluded by domestic law. Following\nWWII, MI6 (Brits) took over management of select Ukronazis from the CIA, which\nwas busy importing a boatload (many thousands) of German Nazis to work for the\nMIC.\n\nThis explains why the Brits were crucial to organizing the Western (post-coup)\nproxy government in Ukraine to do the bidding of the West against the\ninterests of the people of Ukraine. MI6 reportedly provided security for (US\nprefect in Ukraine) Zelensky. It was BoJo (Boris Johnson) who ended peace\ntalks between Russia and Ukraine in March-April 2022 (at Biden\u2019s behest).\n\nOn the domestic front, the CIA openly interfered in the 2020 election on Joe\nBiden\u2019s behalf with the \u2018Russian Disinformation\u2019 fraud regarding Hunter\nBiden\u2019s laptop. In fact the laptop had been vetted by the FBI a year prior and\nwas known to be authentic.\n\nFurther, in the modern history of the US, Congressional Committees have been\nused to create fake before and after scenarios, breaks with the past, for\ndomestic political purposes. Dirty laundry gets partially aired,\nCongresspeople huff and puff, and then a worse version of the objectionable\nactivities gets built.
