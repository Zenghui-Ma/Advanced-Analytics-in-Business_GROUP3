C. Halperin.\n\nIn the depths of an ancient Maya pyramid and temple in Guatemala,\narchaeologists have made a startling discovery. Scorched bones believed to\nbelong to royalty and burned rare artifacts hint at a ceremonial desecration\nlinked to a significant political upheaval in the distant past. The remains\nwere discarded within the foundations of the temple, which was still under\nconstruction at the time of the dramatic event.\n\nResearchers believe this sacrilege is linked to the rise of a transformative\nMaya leader sometime around 1,200 years ago.\n\n## Transition through fire\n\nAt the archaeological site of Ucanal, a team led by Christina Halperin at the\nUniversity of Montreal unexpectedly found the charred deposit beneath a\npyramid temple structure. They found bones from at least four people, along\nwith thousands of ornamental greenstones, shell beads, pendants made of mammal\nteeth, and various weapons \u2014 items that indicate high status.\n\nIt became clear that the human remains belonged to royalty when, after hours\nof sifting through ash, the archaeologists found the nosepiece and obsidian\neye discs of a burial mask.\n\nSome of the bones and beads exhibit evidence of high-temperature combustion.\nThis suggests everything was piled up and set ablaze \u2014 which is notable\nbecause Maya royalty was never cremated.\n\nLike the Egyptians, the remains of the Mayan elites were laid inside\ninaccessible tombs. But what archaeologists found at Ucanal looks more like a\ndump hastily covered with debris rather than a ceremonial tomb.\n\nThe intense heat required to cause the observed damage to the bones suggests a\nmassive inferno, possibly exceeding 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n## A new ruler marks a new era\n\nBurned and cracked greenstone ornaments.

Halperin.\n\nAccording to radiocarbon dating, the event took place between 773 and 881 AD.\nThis dramatic ritual appears to coincide with the emergence of a leader named\nPapmalil, notable for his unusual title, \u201cochk\u2019in kaloomte,\u201d or \u201cwestern\noverlord\u201d. This is unusual, the researchers say, because Maya leadership\nrarely came from the military.\n\nHalperin believes that what Papmalil did was a \u201cfire-entering rite\u201d, a ritual\nthat marks the end of a previous dynasty and the birth of new leadership. The\nremains were probably removed from a tomb and burned in public for all to see.\nAfter the fire, the charred bones and artifacts would have been dumped in the\ntemple pyramid, cementing Papmalil\u2019s ascension to power.\n\nAround this time, Papmalil\u2019s new regime dismantled old monuments, ordered new\npublic buildings built, and formed new political alliances.\n\n\u201cWe know so little about the politics that are happening during this time, and\nso it\u2019s an important event that helps us recognize a political transition. It\nreally emphasizes that yes, political dynasties collapsed. But there\u2019s also\nrenewal and a reworking of a society in different areas of the Maya world,\u201d\nHalperin said.\n\nThe discovery at Ucanal, once the bustling capital of the Maya\u2019s K\u2019anwitznal\nkingdom, not only highlights the dynamic nature of Maya political life but\nalso emphasizes the continuity and resilience of Maya society through periods\nof profound change. Finding such direct evidence of political and social\ntransformation is incredibly rare and valuable in understanding the evolution\nof Maya culture, conclude the researchers.\n\nThe findings were reported in the journal Antiquity.\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n  * What is hyaluronic acid\n  * What is a Chromebook and why you might love one\n\n  * The chicken came before the egg \u2013 hen lays \u2018eggless\u2019 chick in Sri Lanka farm\n  * One of Saturn\u2019s ring has played tricks on astronomers for years\n\nTags: Maya civilizationUcanal\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise\n  * Editorial Policy\n  * Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n  * How we review products\n  * Contact\n\n\u00a9 2007-2023 ZME Science - Not exactly rocket science.
