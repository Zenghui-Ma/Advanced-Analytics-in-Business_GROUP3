The sunflower is a well-known\nexample of such a \u201cspiral phyllotaxis\u201d pattern:\n\nIt\u2019s really magical that this works at all, since the spatial relationship of\neach seed to its neighbors is unique, changing constantly as the pattern\nexpands outwardly\u2014unlike, say, the cells in a honeycomb, which are all\nequivalent. I wondered if the same magic could be applied to surfaces that are\nnot flat, like spheres, toruses, or wine glasses. It\u2019s an interesting question\nfrom an aesthetic point of view, but also a practical one: the answer has\napplications in space exploration and modern architecture.\n\nTo reproduce the flat sunflower pattern mathematically, you need to know three\nsecrets of the arrangement:\n\n  1. Seeds spiral outward from the center, each positioned at a fixed angle relative to its predecessor.\n  2. The fixed angle is the golden angle, \u03b3 = 2\u03c0(1 \u2013 1/\u03a6), where \u03a6 is the golden ratio.\n  3. The ith seed in the pattern is placed at a distance from the center proportional to the square root of i.\n\nYou can make a picture of that arrangement easily if you think in polar\ncoordinates, with the ith seed placed at coordinate {r, \u03b8} = {\u221ai, i \u03b3}:\n\nThe reason that the radial distance of the ith seed is proportional to \u221ai is\nnot difficult to understand. Suppose the ith seed is at distance d from the\ncenter. Then the disk of radius d contains i seeds. In order to achieve an\neven density of seeds, the number of seeds i in a disk must stand in constant\nproportion to its area \u03c0d^2, or:\n\n> i \u221d d^2\n\nInverting that relationship gives:\n\n> d \u221d \u221ai\n\nYou can apply the same reasoning to the problem of distributing seeds evenly\non a hemisphere. To deal with hemispherical surfaces, it helps to think of the\npositions of the seeds in fixed-radius spherical coordinates {\u03c6, \u03b8}, where \u03b8\nplays the same angular role as in polar coordinates and \u03c6\u2014the angular distance\nfrom the north pole along the hemisphere to a point\u2014plays the role of r in\npolar coordinates. This figure shows the correspondence between polar\ncoordinates and fixed-radius spherical coordinates:\n\nThe relationship between the area of a spherical cap and its angular radius is\nnot the square root, as in the plane, but something else. To determine what it\nis, I started with the expression given in MathWorld for the area of a surface\nof revolution generated by rotating the parametric curve {x(t), z(t)} about\nthe z-axis:\n\nFor a spherical cap with angular radius \u03c6, the generating curve is the\ncircular arc defined by\n\nas t goes from 0 to \u03c6.\n\nTo find the formula for the cap\u2019s area, you don\u2019t need to know anything about\nintegration. You just plug the values of x, z, t_0 = 0, and t_1 = \u03c6 into the\narea formula, and out pops the cap\u2019s area:\n\nAs in the planar case, I wanted i, the number of seeds, to stand in constant\nproportion to the area of the hemispherical cap, or:\n\n> i \u221d (1-Cos[\u03c6])\n\nIntroducing c as the constant of proportionality, I found the relationship I\nsought using Solve:\n\nThe two solutions differ in the direction that the seeds spiral around the\ncenter.\n\nThe constant of proportionality c governs the density of the seeds. I solved\nfor its value as a function of the total number of seeds n and the maximum\nangular radius \u03c6_max:\n\nThus if I want 1,000 seeds in the entire hemisphere, which corresponds to an\nangular radius \u03c6 of 90\u00b0, I set c to\n\nPutting all these results together yields the seed-covered hemisphere. The\nforms of the coordinate and graphics expressions here are analogous to the\nforms in the planar case above:\n\nIf you were building a hemispherical house, this would be the basis of a good\nroofing pattern, since each equal-sized shingle overlaps the joint between the\ntwo below it. Or, if you wanted to design approximately equal-area flat panels\nto assemble into a dome, this distribution would be a starting point. This\nproblem of \u201ctectonics\u201d\u2014how to realize curved surfaces with flat materials\u2014is a\nhot topic in current architectural research. A similar problem arose in the\nStarshine 3 student satellite project, which required a spherical satellite to\nbe evenly covered with reflective mirrors. The folks at the U.S. Naval\nResearch Laboratory solved that problem with a phyllotaxic pattern.\n\nComputing a custom function to cover each new kind of surface was an\ninteresting mathematical journey, but a lot of work. What I really wanted was\na single function that would, once and for all, distribute points evenly on\nany surface of revolution whose generating curve I could describe\nparametrically.\n\nAs with the disk and hemisphere, the secret to achieving an even distribution\nof points on an arbitrary surface of revolution is to make the number of\npoints in an area proportional to the area. Unfortunately, the integral that\ndescribes that relationship often has no closed-form solution, even for simple\nparametric curves. But fortunately, we don\u2019t need a closed-form solution to\nobtain a result. Numerical integration does nicely.\n\nThe numerical analog of the area integral above for generating functions x and\nz, and parameter interval t_0 to t_1, uses the NIntegrate function in place of\nIntegrate:\n\nThis function gives area as a function of curve parameter t, but I needed the\ninverse relationship: given an area, I wanted to know what t is. Since I\ncouldn\u2019t invert this function directly, I made a table of {area, t} pairs and\ninterpolated that to give myself a function that, from empirical evidence,\napproximates the inverse sufficiently well:\n\nWith those components, I assembled the function for rendering arbitrary\nphyllotaxic surfaces. Parameters x and z give the parametric description of\nthe generating curve, {t0,t1} specifies the interval of the curve that\ngenerates the surface, density specifies the density of points, and radius\ngives the radius of the spheres that render the points.\n\nI tested the function with a covering of a complete sphere:\n\nAs on a sunflower\u2019s disk, the points on the sphere group into spirals that\nregroup as you move from the poles toward the equator. To make that structure\nmore apparent, I modified the rendering function so I could specify that every\nnth point should have a given color, and rendered spheres with n = 2, 3, ...,\n13. The resulting images revealed a variety of spiral structures lurking\nwithin the pattern.\n\nCombinations of colorings layered on top of one another show the complex\ninterplay of spiral structures:\n\nSince Mathematica\u2018s integration functions are completely general, I could\nexplore generating curves of all sorts, including piecewise and interpolated\ncurves. Here\u2019s a sample of some phyllotaxic surfaces of revolution I\nencountered (click an image to see an enlargement):\n\nCurious what a phyllotaxic wine glass would look like, I grabbed an image of a\nPeugeot wine glass from the web and used the Get Coordinates function to\ndigitize its outline, which I fed to Interpolation to get the x and z\nparametric functions of the curve. This is the resulting parametric curve:\n\nWith those functions, it\u2019s a no-brainer to make a phyllotaxic wine glass.\n\nThe spiral structures in this form, with its concave and convex surfaces and\nwide variation of diameters, were especially interesting to explore. Here\u2019s\none study that I particularly liked. It exploits the fact that when you color\nevery seventh point, you get three distinct spirals at small diameters. I\nomitted the other six points entirely so that those spirals stood on their own\nin the stem, and gave each of them a different color. By choosing cyan,\nyellow, and magenta, the base and bowl of the glass are a neutral gray when\nviewed from a distance, and yet it shimmers almost iridescently as it moves,\ndue to the moir\u00e9 patterns induced by the patterns on the opposite sides. The\nmagic of spiral phyllotaxis unites all the parts into one festive whole.\n\nAlas, the effect requires spheres too tiny to bond together, so they\u2019d have to\nbe embedded in a clear glass matrix. When the day arrives that clear glass can\nbe 3D-printed, I\u2019ll be first in line. Meanwhile, there are plenty of other\nintriguing phyllotaxic surfaces waiting to be discovered.\n\nClick here to download this post as a Mathematica Notebook.\n\n4.8k Shares\n\n#### Posted in:\n\n  * Best of Blog (70)\n  * Recreational Computation (163)\n\nChristopher Carlson, Senior User Interface Developer, User Interfaces\n\n#### Comments\n\nJoin the discussion\n\n### 22 comments\n\n  1. Some of your phyllotaxic surfaces of revolution reminded me very much of the green shells of sea urchins. The spiral perhaps isn\u2019t obvious but the equal density spacing of the quills would make sense biologically.\n\nReply\n\nMark D\n\nJuly 28, 2011 at 9:49 am 07/28/2011 at 9:49 am\n\n  2. It might also be interesting to see what happens when, instead of varying the colours of points (or in addition to), you also vary the size of spheres.\n\nThanks for another very cool creative post. Looking forward to your next one!\n\nReply\n\nMark D\n\nJuly 28, 2011 at 10:00 am 07/28/2011 at 10:00 am\n\n  3. Nice post!!\n\nA simple test is to plot the histogram of the distances between each point and\nthe nearest, for the first graph. All points are about 1.7 from each other.\n\nReply\n\nigo\n\nJuly 28, 2011 at 3:40 pm 07/28/2011 at 3:40 pm\n\n  4. Very nice post!

If each point on the surface was a magnet with N and S poles, how would they align? 2. Would it be possible to apply this approach to packing in a volume vs. a surface?\n\nReply\n\nLance Otis\n\nSeptember 16, 2011 at 12:23 am 09/16/2011 at 12:23 am\n\n  7. Dear Christopher, I teach design at Penn State, and I am working on how to teach the creative process to scientists, mathematicians and engineers. What I would appreciate is a clarification about your process. Do you start with, \u201cI see mathematical process in this sunflower\u201d so how can I apply it to something else? Or, I\u2019ve got this problem, now I\u2019m going out and looking for organic solutions to the problem at hand. I realize it\u2019s probably a bit of both- Your thoughts? thanks\n\nReply\n\nRenee Kredell\n\nSeptember 18, 2011 at 8:47 am 09/18/2011 at 8:47 am\n\n  8. Renee \u2013\n\nIn this case it was the first way around. I was intrigued by the mathematics\nand spatial organization of the sunflower pattern and wondered if that\nstructure could be generalized to non-planar surfaces and if so, what it would\nlook like. I was aware of practical applications, but that\u2019s not what drove me\nto explore.\n\nAs far as creativity goes, it\u2019s analogy that drives much of what I do. When I\nrun across an interesting phenomenon, I like to extract it from its context\nand think about how it could be explored in completely different ones. What\nwould a Steve Reich piece look like if it were layers of frieze symmetries?\nWhat would the Op artists have done with interactive graphics? What if mullion\npatterns were musical rhythms? ...\n\nReply\n\nChristopher Carlson\n\nSeptember 19, 2011 at 9:19 am 09/19/2011 at 9:19 am\n\n  9.

Being a big Fibonacci fan I have some experience with this stuff. I unashamedly used your Peugeot wine glass data to make 3d models in straight Manifolds. The difference in a connected Cuboid Model and one with Sphere in 3ds memory use is 50 to 1: 44.4 megabytes for the Spheres and 0.827 for the Cuboids. Yes, your sphere model is too big for present technology, but probably not for long. I remember well when I was using a Commodore 64 and a I megabyte Amiga right after that. You do good elegant programming. Roger Bagula\n\nReply\n\nRoger Bagula\n\nOctober 23, 2011 at 12:11 pm 10/23/2011 at 12:11 pm\n\n  13. Superb demonstration. Could you actually pack the sphere with little spheres using a Fibonacci packing approach. In other words, you nicely show the surface of a sphere packed by spheres in a 3-D Sunflower pattern \u2013 what would the inside of such a sphere look like if it were filled with the smaller spheres?\n\nReply\n\nProf. Greg Parker\n\nApril 5, 2013 at 9:50 am 04/05/2013 at 9:50 am\n\n     * That\u2019s an interesting question. The sphere packing on the surface depends on the structure of the spiral traced out on the surface. I don\u2019t see any obvious way to continue it into the interior. Alternatively, perhaps you could lay spheres along a curve that loosely \u201cfills\u201d the surface and interior of the sphere, arriving at a 3D, spherical analog of the the 2D packed disk. Good question, though, what that curve would be.\n\nReply\n\nChristopher Carlson\n\nApril 29, 2013 at 3:50 pm 04/29/2013 at 3:50 pm\n\n       * My feeling is that for an efficient packing you will need to increase the sphere radius as you move out from the centre (actually it is more than a feeling, I know you will need to do this as I have played with models of this type made up of ball bearings). But I do have a feeling that this Fibonacci sphere packing will give you the highest sphere packing density possible for a spherical container \u2013 but unlike the conventional sphere packing problem you will need to use spheres of different radii.\n\nReply\n\nProf. Greg Parker\n\nJuly 25, 2013 at 2:47 pm 07/25/2013 at 2:47 pm\n\n  14.

I\u2019ve been looking for a way to cite the golden angle spiral on a sphere. It appears to be known by others at least in 2006 but they also don\u2019t cite a source.\n\nhttp://www.softimageblog.com/archives/115\n\nAny idea on the provenance of this algorithm?\n\nBy the way \u2013 thanks for this post, it\u2019s very insightful and a neat\ngeneralization to arbitrary phi (not just 180 degrees). In terms of minimizing\nthe size of gaps between points (i.e. the furthest distance from any point)\nI\u2019ve found it does extremely well. Much better than Saff\u2019s algorithm and\nwithin a whisker of the electrostatic repulsion methods, which are iterative\nand much slower.\n\nReply\n\nEguh Renob\n\nSeptember 16, 2015 at 5:07 pm 09/16/2015 at 5:07 pm\n\n  17.
