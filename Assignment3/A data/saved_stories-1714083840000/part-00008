The Department\nof Health and Human Services (HHS) then issued a guidance clarifying that\nabortion services are encompassed within emergency medical care protected by\nthe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). EMTALA, which\nwas passed in 1986, stipulates that hospitals that receive federal funding are\nrequired to provide emergency services to all patients arriving at their\nfacilities.\n\n\u201cUnder the law, no matter where you live, women have the right to emergency\ncare \u2014 including abortion care,\u201d said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in July\n2022. \u201cToday, in no uncertain terms, we are reinforcing that we expect\nproviders to continue offering these services, and that federal law preempts\nstate abortion bans when needed for emergency care. Protecting both patients\nand providers is a top priority, particularly in this moment.\u201d\n\nSince the constitutional right to an abortion was reversed by Dobbs in 2022,\n14 states have completely banned abortion, with Arizona on the verge of\nbecoming the 15th. Additionally, numerous states, including Florida, have\nrestricted abortion access as early as six weeks into pregnancy.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nReproductive Rights\n\n## Idaho Asks Supreme Court to Let State Prosecute Doctors, Ban Abortions\n\nThe state of Idaho is being represented by the designated hate group, the\nAlliance Defending Freedom.\n\nBy\n\n    Zane McNeill ,\n    Truthout\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nTruthout\n\nIn August 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit claiming that\nIdaho\u2019s Defense of Life Act was overridden by EMTALA under the Supremacy\nClause of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that federal law\ntakes precedence over state law in specific domains. A district court ruled in\nfavor of the DOJ, determining that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban violated EMTALA, and\npartially halted the implementation of the law. In September, a three-judge\npanel composed of Trump-appointed judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of\nAppeals permitted Idaho to enforce its ban. However, in November, the full 9th\nCircuit overturned the panel\u2019s decision, granting the DOJ\u2019s request to halt\nthe law while the appeal is ongoing.\n\n\u201cFederal law is clear: patients have the right to stabilizing hospital\nemergency room care no matter where they live,\u201d Becerra said in a statement in\nAugust 2022. \u201cWomen should not have to be near death to get care. The\nDepartment of Health and Human Services will continue its work with the\nDepartment of Justice to enforce federal law protecting access to health care,\nincluding abortions.\u201d\n\nIdaho, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom \u2014 an organization\ndesignated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 appealed to\nthe Supreme Court, aiming to overturn this decision and implement the full\nabortion ban. On January 5, the Court halted the lower-court order that\nblocked Idaho from enforcing its abortion ban, allowing the ban to be fully\nimplemented while the Court reviews the state\u2019s appeal.\n\nWhile state abortion bans often include \u201cexceptions\u201d for life-threatening\npregnancy complications, many hospitals have refused to provide abortion care\nin emergencies out of fear of being prosecuted. Not only has this resulted in\npatients being denied care, with at least one person being forced to miscarry\nin an emergency room restroom, it has also forced doctors to resort to\nunnecessary and risky procedures to avoid potential legal repercussions.\n\nFor example, Idaho\u2019s Defense of Life Act lacks a provision allowing abortion\nas stabilizing care for an emergency medical condition. While it includes an\nexception solely to preserve the life of the pregnant person, physicians have\nexpressed concerns that the state\u2019s abortion ban is vaguely worded and makes\nit challenging to discern when medical intervention for abortion during an\nemergency is permissible without risking prosecution. Those prosecuted under\nthe law could face imprisonment ranging from two to five years, along with the\npotential revocation or suspension of their medical license.\n\nThis has led to doctors refusing to help pregnant people experiencing medical\nemergencies, as well as doctors leaving the state to practice medicine\nelsewhere. In fact, a recent study reveals that Idaho has experienced a 22\npercent decrease in its practicing obstetricians within the 15 months\nfollowing the implementation of the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban.\nAdditionally, due to the \u201clegal and political climate\u201d in the state, at least\none hospital has closed down its obstetric department entirely.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the devastating impact of this case play out in Idaho,\nwhere medical evacuations to transport patients to other states for the care\nthey need have dramatically spiked since the Supreme Court allowed state\npoliticians to block emergency abortion care,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cThis case\nonce again highlights the extraordinary lengths extremist politicians will go\nto control our bodies, our lives, and our ability to get the health care we\nneed.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in this case is expected in June.\n\nDuring the Supreme Court\u2019s oral arguments, the Women\u2019s March orchestrated a\ndie-in protest outside the courthouse to bring attention to the devastating\nimpacts the case could have on pregnant people across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrifying time to be someone who needs critical abortion care in\nAmerica right now,\u201d Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, executive director of Women\u2019s\nMarch, said in a statement to Truthout. \u201cWe know what these cases really are:\nthey\u2019re part of a series of efforts by Christian nationalist politicians to do\nanything they can to control women\u2019s bodies and cut back women\u2019s decisions\nabout their health care, their family planning and their lives.\u201d\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
