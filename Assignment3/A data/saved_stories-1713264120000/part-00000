However,\n> most current approaches suffer from two distinct problems: Modern model-free\n> algorithms such as Soft Actor Critic need a high number of samples to learn\n> a meaningful policy, as well as a fallback to ward against concept drifts\n> (e. g., catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we present the work in\n> progress towards a hybrid agent architecture that combines model-based Deep\n> Reinforcement Learning with imitation learning to overcome both problems.\n\nComments:| Accepted as publication at MSCPES '24  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.01794 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2404.01794v1 [cs.AI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.01794arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Eric Veith [view email] [v1] Tue, 2 Apr 2024 09:55:30 UTC (416 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Imitation Game: A Model-based and Imitation\nLearning Deep Reinforcement Learning Hybrid, by Eric MSP Veith and 4 other\nauthors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
