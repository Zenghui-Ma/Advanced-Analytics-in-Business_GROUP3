At the same time, global investment in clean\nenergy manufacturing is booming, driven by industrial policies and market\ndemand. Employment in clean energy jobs exceeded that of fossil fuels in 2021\nand continues to grow.\n\nQuantifying the expanding role of clean energy in the economy is therefore\nessential to fully understand the stakes and momentum behind energy\ntransitions.\n\n#### Clean energy accounted for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023\n\nOur new country-by-country and sector-by-sector analysis finds that in 2023,\nclean energy added around USD 320 billion to the world economy. This\nrepresented 10% of global GDP growth \u2013 equivalent to more than the value added\nby the global aerospace industry in 2023, or to adding an economy the size of\nthe Czech Republic to global output.\n\nThis assessment is based on a first-of-its-kind analysis of three categories\nof activity in the clean energy sector:\n\n  * Manufacturing of clean energy technologies: investment in clean energy manufacturing, covering the value chains for solar PV, wind power and battery manufacturing\n  * Deployment of clean power capacity: investment in deployment of clean electricity generation capacity \u2013 such as solar PV, wind power, nuclear power and battery storage \u2013 and in electricity networks\n  * Clean equipment sales: sales of electric cars (EVs) and heat pumps.\n\nIt is based on detailed project-by-project data gathered and processed by the\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) from primary and secondary sources. We\nconducted this analysis at the country level, and present here the in-depth\nresults for four of the largest economies: the United States, the European\nUnion, China and India, which together account for two-thirds of global GDP.1\n\nGDP in the United States grew by a robust 2.5% in 2023. Clean energy was an\nimportant contributor: The Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan\nInfrastructure Law drove a surge in investment in clean energy manufacturing,\nand sales of EVs also grew strongly. Consequently, clean energy growth\naccounted for around 6% of GDP growth in the world\u2019s largest economy in 2023.\nThis is comparable in scale to the contribution to GDP growth in 2023 from the\nUnited States\u2019 booming, artificial-intelligence-driven digital economy.2\n\nClean energy accounted for around one-fifth of China\u2019s 5.2% GDP growth in\n2023. Each of the three categories assessed grew strongly, with the largest\nincrease coming from investment in clean power capacity, followed by clean\nequipment sales, particularly EVs. Expansion in clean energy manufacturing\naccounted for around 5% of China\u2019s GDP growth in 2023, although the country\u2019s\nsurplus production capacity in technologies such as batteries (utilisation\nrates were around 30% in 2023) may limit the scope of this growth driver going\nforward. Similar assessments have come to comparable conclusions, albeit with\nslightly different boundaries.\n\nIn the European Union, clean energy accounted for nearly one-third of GDP\ngrowth in 2023, the highest share of any region assessed, although its share\nis inflated by weak overall GDP growth of around 0.5%. Nonetheless, the EU\u2019s\nstrong climate targets and policies, such as the Fit for 55 package and the\nproposed Net Zero Industry Act, are supporting investments in clean energy\nmanufacturing, which more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, driven in\nparticular by battery manufacturing.\n\nIndia was the fastest growing large economy in 2023, with GDP increasing by\naround 7.7%. Clean energy contributed slightly less than 5% of GDP growth in\n2023, predominantly from investment in new solar power capacity. Meanwhile,\npolicies such as the Production Linked Incentive are attracting investment in\nnew clean energy manufacturing capacity. In 2023, this remained relatively\nsmall as a portion of India\u2019s overall economy, but interest from businesses\nand investors is increasing.\n\n### Contribution of investment and sales in selected clean energy technologies\nto GDP growth, 2023\n\nOpen\n\nAssessing the extent to which different sectors of the clean energy economy\ncontribute to GDP growth from year to year helps show the direction of travel.\nYet looking at their share of GDP in a single year is also useful in\nunderstanding their economic importance. In 2023, clean energy investment and\nsales accounted for between 1% and 4% of total GDP in the four major regions\nassessed \u2013 substantial shares in the context of these large and diversified\neconomies. The chemicals industry accounts for about 3% of value added in\nIndia and China. Clean energy technologies therefore already provide a sizable\ncontribution to GDP in these economies today.\n\nThe clean energy sector also drove a substantial share of total investment\ngrowth across the economy in these regions in 2023. In the case of China, it\ncontributed 50% of the growth in total investment in 2023, and 20% in the\nUnited States. At the global level, we estimate that around USD 200 billion\nwas invested in clean energy technology manufacturing in 2023, an increase of\n75% over the previous year. This compares with global capital investment in\nsemiconductor manufacturing of around USD 170 billion to 250 billion per year\nin recent years.\n\n### Share of investment and sales in selected clean energy technologies in\nGDP, 2023\n\nOpen\n\n### Share of investment in selected clean energy technologies in total\ninvestment, 2023\n\nOpen\n\nThis analysis highlights the scale and weight of the clean energy economy. It\nshows that it is not only growing quickly, but also has already become a\npowerful economic force. As energy transitions advance, clean energy\u2019s\nimportance for economies around the world is only set to grow further.\n\nModernising energy and industrial systems to drive energy transitions requires\nvery large investments and the transformation of huge markets. It also comes\nwith many significant benefits beyond mitigating climate change and reducing\nair pollution alone; in 2023, 36 million workers were employed across clean\nenergy supply chains.\n\nAnd while China still leads in investment in the manufacturing of clean energy\ntechnologies, other regions are also seeing a jump in projects and\ninvestments. The large share of one country has raised questions about the\nresilience and diversity of global clean energy technology supply chains, but\nit also currently provides opportunities to accelerate global decarbonisation\nbased on an abundant supply of low-cost clean energy equipment. The analysis\ndeveloped here highlights the importance of comprehensively assessing the size\nof the clean energy economy when designing energy, climate and industrial\npolicies.\n\n##### References\n\n  1.
