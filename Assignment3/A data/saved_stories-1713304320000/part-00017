In that time, we\u2019ve ridden a wave of excitement about the current\nutility and future impact of large language models (LLMs). These tools already\nhave hundreds of millions of weekly users, analysts are projecting a multi-\ntrillion dollar contribution to the economy, and there\u2019s now a growing array\nof credible competitors to OpenAI.\n\nYet there\u2019s plenty of trepidation too. Corporate horror stories, policy\nrestrictions, and hallucinations understandably give people pause about\ndeploying GenAI, and general technophobia mean that most people globally have\nstill not tried it. Even amongst the world\u2019s billion knowledge workers, just\n10% use ChatGPT (which enjoys 60% market share) regularly. Of those who have,\nmany complain that it\u2019s simply not useful: \u201cNot a single use case in my life\ncomes to mind when thinking of ChatGPT and everyone is going insane about it,\u201d\nbemoaned one user. Others have been put off that the technology gets things\nwrong: \u201cIt\u2019s so confidently incorrect about enough things for me to cast doubt\non all of its answers,\u201d said another.\n\nFrom dozens of conversations with business leaders and chief learning officers\naround the world, I\u2019ve gained a strong impression that what\u2019s missing is\nconvincing, real-world, real-life use cases. Are people really using these\ntools? Have they found ways for generative AI to help them lighten their\nworkloads, increase their productivity, think through problems in new ways?\nThe web is replete with surface-level examples such as \u201ctext summarization\u201d or\n\u201cgenerating marketing copy\u201d or \u201ccode review.\u201d But these sanitized, generic\nphrases read like items from a feature list and do little to entice the\nuninitiated. The devil \u2014 and delight \u2014 is in the details.\n\nTo find out more about those details, my company, Filtered Technologies, mined\nthe web to find concrete examples of it being used in the wild. We\u2019ve done\nthis before, with Excel tips and productivity tips. We searched for specific\nuse cases of individuals deriving benefit from LLMs, in business or life. It\nturns out the real treasure is buried deep in popular online forums (Quora,\nReddit, etc.). Reddit, in particular, is a rich source of material for this\nstudy, as well as for the LLMs themselves; 10% of the company\u2019s revenue is now\ngenerated by selling its user-generated content as training data to LLMs ahead\nof its mooted IPO.\n\nMy team and I filtered through tens of thousands of posts for our report. The\nvolume was important. The detritus you\u2019d expect from mostly anonymous online\ninteractions was abundant: inanity, repetition, jibes, abuse and more. But\nthere were plenty of diamonds in the rough too. By looking for these\nauthentic, rich and often hilarious examples, use-case categories were\nunearthed, which eventually numbered well over 100. For each category we kept\na tally of how many stories we found, and this became a major factor (along\nwith some expert assessment) in ordering the list. We surface a selection of\nthe authentic, positive, illuminating examples for your convenience and\ncuriosity below.\n\n## What We Found\n\nThere are many use cases for generative AI, spanning a vast number of areas of\ndomestic and work life. The use of this technology is as wide-ranging as the\nproblems we encounter in our lives. We divided the 100 categories we\nidentified into six top-level themes, which give an immediate sense of what\ngenerative AI is being used for:\n\n  * Technical Assistance & Troubleshooting (23%)\n  * Content Creation & Editing (22%)\n  * Personal & Professional Support (17%)\n  * Learning & Education (15%)\n  * Creativity & Recreation (13%)\n  * Research, Analysis & Decision Making (10%)\n\nThe themes provide an immediate demonstration the technology\u2019s broad utility.\nIt can be used for work and leisure. It can be useful for creative as well as\ntechnical endeavors. It can be used to help us think, learn, do, solve, create\nand enjoy.\n\nWe found examples that apply to both individuals and organizations.\n\nThe list is, of course, compiled from examples of reports from ordinary people\nwho are doing ordinary things better, faster, or more happily using generative\nAI. Individuals can look up and down the list and notice what grabs their\nattention (or notice that they\u2019ve found a use beyond what\u2019s listed below).\nGiven the size of the list, you are very likely to spot some uses to bring to\nyour own work or home life.\n\nBusinesses can use it too. If you\u2019re one of the early corporate adopters (most\nlikely with the most entrenched supplier, Microsoft and Copilot), you\u2019ll be\nwanting to encourage engagement from your workforce. If your organization is\ncurrently taking a more cautious approach, be aware that many of your\nemployees are using it anyway. Acknowledging and harnessing this latent\ncuriosity \u2014 in a way that aligns with your organization\u2019s IT policies \u2014 must\nbe better than just simply outlawing the practice. As Noelle Russell, chief AI\nofficer at the AI Leadership Institute points out, \u201cIn our second year of\ngenerative AI, companies are beginning to ask harder questions that were\npreviously silenced by enthusiasm, about security, accuracy, fairness, and\nperformance. The use-cases drive the understanding, scrutiny, and maturity to\nachieve enterprise scale.\u201d If you can play a part in the winning of hearts and\nminds, perhaps the list will help you persuade stakeholders and the powers\nthat be.\n\n## What Users Are Doing\n\nHere are some samples from the 100, with one quote for each. The full list is\nat the bottom of this article.\n\n  * Generating ideas (#1). \u201cI love it for brainstorming because it\u2019s like the perfect teammate. It can keep up with me and doesn\u2019t get hung up on dead-end ideas, and it can summarize what we come up with so it\u2019s easier to present or reference later on.\u201d\n  * Specific search (#2). \u201cThere was a particular cookie my grandmother used to give me and I really liked the taste and texture, and I had looked at the grocery to no avail until one evening ... I decided that it might be fruitful to ask ChatGPT for help ... It was SnackWell\u2019s.\u201d\n  * Editing text (#4). \u201cI use it to check my own biases with op-eds and speeches and other political stuff. If something makes me feel strongly, I copy it into ChatGPT and ask it to tell me the logical fallacies and possible misinformation in the piece. It is a HUGE gut check!!\u201d\n  * Drafting emails (#11). \u201cI work in investor relations and the amount of time I\u2019ve saved using ChatGPT to help me draft emails is almost unquantifiable.\u201d\n  * Simple explainers (#12). \u201cIt\u2019s also way better at explaining concepts to non-engineers than us engineers are. By default it writes at a 5th-grade level, which is perfect for a lot of people we interact with at work.\u201d\n  * Excel formulas (#14). \u201cI have to write a lot of .vb and Excel formulas to reconcile data from less technical people. ChatGPT helps 45-minute tasks take about three to five minutes.\u201d\n  * Making a complaint (#23). \u201cA car wash damaged my wife\u2019s SUV and refused to pay, so GPT drafted a demand letter for me, and I took them to small claims court.\u201d\n  * Generating appraisals (#26). \u201cI know some managers who use it to help punch up performance appraisal write ups for their employees.\u201d\n  * Editing legal doc (#44). \u201cI fed it a long, overly complex service level agreement for a SaaS contract and ask it to rewrite it to make it simpler and easier to digest. It kept the important SLA terms but condensed the language by 70%.\u201d\n  * Sampling data (#85). \u201cIt\u2019s great for producing demo data. [If you] need a bunch of fake company names or customer names or product codes, ChatGPT is good at deriving stuff like that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s telling that the most common use case is idea generation. We naturally\nthink of content (text, images, synthetic data) as the output to expect from\ngenerative AI \u2014 it\u2019s virtually built into the definition. But it seems that\nout in the real world, people have developed a wider concept of what the\ntechnology is generating, and it includes ideas. This is not just semantics.\nSince ideas are not final outputs, with this use case, generative AI is\nsupporting existing part-automated, part-manual processes rather than\nreplacing them with wholesale automation. This is also true for each of the 15\nlearning and education use cases in the list. Such human-plus-machine\ncollaboration feels less threatening to the trepidatious majority. Indeed, for\nalmost every single use-case in the list, there\u2019s a human somewhere in the\nloop to check, approve and utilize the results AI generates.\n\nOur analysis also shows that expensive professional services are now\naccessible to far more people \u2014 13 items on the list are about the law, coding\nor medicine. Legal documents can be understood, edited, and drawn up from\nscratch without appointing a lawyer or incurring fees. Code can be written,\nreviewed, and generated in seconds. People are bypassing medical experts with\ngenerative AI too. Experts are expensive, inaccessible to many, and typically\nnot available on-demand, 24/7. And the web is unable to provide personalized\nadvice and support. So, people are starting to see generative AI as the best\nof both: cheap, accessible, always-on, instantaneous, and personalized. (Of\ncourse, we need to exercise caution here too. These models, while advanced, do\nnot always fully grasp the nuanced, context-specific knowledge and ethical\nconsiderations at play, and will therefore sometimes offer oversimplified or\nincorrect advice and outputs.)\n\nThe list has a more-or-less even balance of work and leisure examples. Indeed,\nfor many use cases we find both an example from each, such as for language\ntranslation (#18), drafting a formal letter (#31) and fact-checking (#52).\nJared Spataro, Microsoft corporate vice president, AI at Work, agrees that\nnon-work examples are important at this early stage. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re\nlearning with our customers is the importance of offering clear and practical\nguidance on how to get started with AI,\u201d he says. This research goes a long\nway in helping people understand how to integrate AI into their day-to-day\nlives so they can enjoy the many benefits it has to offer.\n\nThe list of use cases will evolve. The technology is developing and so is the\ningenuity with which people apply it. Indeed, one of the main points of this\narticle is to encourage, sensible, safe, tangibly useful experimentation of\ngenerative AI. But I also fancy that a good number of the list are evergreen\nbecause they support timeless pursuits: learning, communicating, thinking.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nReal people are really getting plenty from generative AI. These examples can\nhelp us better understand where it\u2019s actually creating value in people\u2019s\npersonal and professional lives. With any popular new technology, there are\nmany fans and many detractors, like the two skeptics at the beginning of this\npiece. Who will have the last laugh though? The gleeful celebration of AI\ntripping up is irresistible and will do the social media rounds, for now. But\nwhereas the appeal of this schadenfreude will fade, the real stories of AI\nhelping human lives will stay and spread. As one enthusiast said \u201cPeople that\ndon\u2019t find it useful, simply haven\u2019t really understood how to use it.\u201d Another\nput it more sharply: \u201cThe 5% or whatever who use it effectively are going to\nsmoke the others.\u201d\n\nSee more HBR charts in Data & Visuals\n\nNew!\n\nHBR Learning\n\nDigital Intelligence Course\n\nAccelerate your career with Harvard ManageMentor\u00ae.
