For instance, according to a study\n> from Zepto, the majority of the grocery spend by Indian consumers is through\n> small tickets, high frequency purchases, which is suitable for QC format\n> rather than MR. In general, the number of SKUs in an Indian kitchen is far\n> higher than in the West and hence there is always a need for top-up items,\n> which is better serviced from local stores than MR.\n>\n> Moreover, most Indian kitchens don\u2019t have the space to store monthly\n> groceries, unlike in developed markets. There is less propensity to spend on\n> monthly groceries in one shot and also customers prefer to buy higher share\n> of fresh food, which is all better suited to QC compared to MR.\n>\n> QC also offers the unique proposition of a large number of SKUs, as high as\n> MR, with proximity that is as good as unorganised retail. The number of SKUs\n> has gone up from 2K to 6K in each QC dark store now and Zepto is looking to\n> increase it further to 10-12K. Expansion of QC in typical e-com categories\n> such as fashion, electricals, and house-hold consumables will likely\n> continue to expand the QC TAM as well.\n\nBlinkIt, Instamart, Quick commerce, Retail, Zepto\n\nIndiadispatch.xyz curates essential news and insights on Indian startups,\ntechnology firms, and VC and PE investments.
