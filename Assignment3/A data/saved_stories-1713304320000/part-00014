Therefore, there is\nno concept of \"passing\" or \"failing\" in gpt-vetting.\n\nThe objective is to provide employers with a comprehensive view by offering\nmore data. This includes an AI-generated report based on all responses, as\nwell as a transcript. The transcript reduces the AI bias by allowing humans to\nreview and listen to the answers, aiding them in deciding whether to proceed\nwith interviewing the candidate.\n\nThis process supplements the candidate's resume, LinkedIn profile, and other\nrelevant data points that influence the employer's decision to interview.\n\nIn summary, AI does not pass or fail candidates. Rather, it equips employers\nwith additional data, enabling them to make more informed decisions about\nadvancing candidates to the next stage of the interview process.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### What is gpt-vetting?\n\ngpt-vetting is a AI-powered technical test that quickly & accurately screens\nany type of talent.

We only use this data to come up with a trust score\nwithin the reports.\n\n### What does the report include?\n\nThe report includes an AI assessment of each tech stack, soft skills, coding\ntest performance, and a trust score to prevent cheating.
