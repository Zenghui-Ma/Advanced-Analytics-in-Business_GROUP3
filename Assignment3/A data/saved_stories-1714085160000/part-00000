Courtesy of the artist.\n\nMy senior year of high school I worked in a coffee shop. I took the bus there\nafter school and stole bagels to eat before my shifts, 3 PM to 11 PM most\nnights. I met a man there\u2014let\u2019s call him Mike. I was 16 when we met; he was\n25. I was 18 when he took me to his place after work one night, poured us rum\nand Cokes until the stars spun above the roof where we sat, and then picked me\nup and carried me down to his bedroom. A few months later, I moved into his\napartment. It was next to the airport, and the planes flew so low it seemed\nlike we could touch them from the rooftop at night.\n\nThat same year I entered a contest and won a $2,000 writing scholarship. It\nwas 1999, and my plan was to take the money and go to New York. I\u2019d been\naccepted to an undergraduate writing program at NYU, but I soon realized the\nmoney I\u2019d won was not nearly enough for that.\n\nMike was always broke. I loved him or I thought I did. He knew more than me or\nI thought he did. I didn\u2019t know then how little men\u2019s attention was worth. I\nstill believed there was a scarcity of it. He needed fifty bucks and I gave it\nto him. He needed a hundred. Then a little more. Soon I had given him all my\nmoney. It happened so easily. One day I realized it was all gone. I sat on the\nfloor and cried. I was afraid that he would leave me, and I was afraid that I\nwould never leave.\n\nNot long after that, we were in bed together in the afternoon. I was naked, on\ntop of him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople would pay to look at you.\u201d\n\nHe had a friend who had a website. The friend and another man would pick me\nup, bring me somewhere, and we would take some pictures. I would get $200;\nMike would get $50. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give all the money to you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t, but I believed him. I needed to. Recognizing one lie would mean\nrecognizing all his lies. If that happened I would have nothing left.\n\nAnother way to tell the story is this: I was 19 and I was in love with Rosa.\nRosa had been a dancer. She\u2019d worked in a club in LA. She\u2019d taken the job\nbecause she\u2019d run out of toilet paper and pawned a gold bracelet her\ngrandmother had given her and she needed to get her bracelet back. But it\nseemed like she loved the job. She told me that when she got up onstage she\ncould be anybody.\n\n\u201cHowever I felt,\u201d she said, \u201cI would just dance it.\u201d\n\nShe told me this in her bedroom, holding a sweating mason jar of vodka soda,\nwearing a white tank top with lacy straps. Her eyes shone. I wanted to kiss\nher almost as badly as I wanted to leave town.\n\nI did kiss her, and I did leave town.\n\nI paid my way to San Francisco with the money I made from the shoot Mike set\nme up with. It was a move that, eventually, saved my life.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that fall my body was the site of\ninternational debate about sex, work, poverty, and consent. In 2000, two\npieces of legislation were passed that marked a new era in the criminalization\nof sex work: the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and the United\nNations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,\nEspecially Women and Children.\n\nFeminists stood on both sides of the debate. Radical feminists and the\nreligious right insisted that \u201cvoluntary prostitution\u201d was an oxymoron and\nfought for both the UN Protocol and the TVPA to legally define all sex trading\nas nonconsensual sex trafficking. Liberal feminists and human rights\norganizations pushed to maintain a legal divide between voluntary and\ninvoluntary sex work. In the end, the liberal feminists won at the UN, but the\nTVPA offered a sweeping definition of sex trafficking as \u201cthe recruitment,\nharboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose\nof a commercial sex act.\u201d The definition included both voluntary and\ninvoluntary commercial sex, but, as a compromise, only criminalized \u201csevere\nforms of trafficking in persons.\u201d Severe forms were defined as circumstances\nin which \u201cforce, fraud, or coercion\u201d were used.\n\nThe codified definitions offered by the TVPA and the UN Protocol did little to\nquell public disagreement about whether trading sex could be done voluntarily,\nor what the legal status of commercial sex should be. To the contrary, the\npassage of the TVPA set off nearly two decades in which more than fifty new\nstate and federal laws were passed, each providing its own definitions of sex\ntrafficking and prostitution. Since 2003, all fifty states have passed at\nleast one law criminalizing sex trafficking. Many create civil as well as\ncriminal liability, and many create third-party liability for businesses that\n\u201cfacilitate\u201d trafficking or prostitution. In Pennsylvania, a 2014 trafficking\nlaw that creates a civil right of action for \u201cvictim[s] of the sex trade\u201d\ndefines victim as anyone who has traded sex or has \u201cbeen the object of a\nsolicitation for prostitution.\u201d In Louisiana, a 2017 trafficking law defines\nanyone who engages in a commercial sex act while under the age of 21 as a\ntrafficking victim, regardless of consent. Many state trafficking laws make\nclear that a person having consented to trade sex is not a defense against a\nsex trafficking charge.\n\n> I usually worked with a camera in the room. That didn\u2019t mean that the\n> content of my work was performance rather than service.\n>\n> Tweet\n\nHad I done my first naked job as a 19-year-old in 2019 Louisiana, rather than\nwhere I was in 2000, I would have been considered a victim of trafficking. As\nit was, my experience easily fell within the TVPA\u2019s definitions of \u201ccoercion\u201d\nor \u201cfraud,\u201d which the Office on Trafficking in Persons says include\n\u201cpsychological manipulation\u201d and \u201cfalse promises regarding . . . love.\u201d\n\nLike all laws, the new trafficking statutes were formed by compromise and\ncompeting intentions. Laws do not develop their full meaning until they are\nused, and even after a law passes, advocates and state actors have the power\nto shape it. Following a century of racist anti-prostitution laws, the\npost-2000 anti-trafficking laws have been used by both lawmakers and social\ninstitutions to define all sex work as trafficking. The passage, use, and\nsubsequent meaning of these laws have been pushed and shaped by far-right\nlawmakers, lobbyists, charity workers, and members of the now lucrative rescue\nindustry, with the tacit\u2014and sometimes not so tacit\u2014goal of delegitimizing and\ncriminalizing everyone who trades sex. FOSTA, the Allow States and Victims to\nFight Online Sex Trafficking Act, signed into law in April 2018, is only the\nmost visible recent iteration. Increased criminalization has resulted in\ndeclining labor conditions for people who trade sex. It has inhibited our\nability to speak openly about these conditions. And it has made it harder for\nus to process our experiences\u2014of coercion and exploitation, solidarity, love,\nand strength\u2014in our own words, or even at all.\n\nThe room I found that I could afford in San Francisco was an hour train ride\nfrom the city\u2019s only queer women\u2019s bar, in a house owned by a woman to whom I\nhad lied, during the interview, and said that I was straight.\n\n\u201cNothing against lesbians,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to live with one.\u201d\n\nIn San Francisco I worked double shifts: opening shift at a day care and\nclosing at a coffee shop. At the coffee shop, my manager developed what other\npeople called a crush on me and started calling me from his home number. At\nfirst, he left relatively benign messages, asking me to go to a show with him.\nWhen I didn\u2019t respond, he kept calling. His voice on the recorder grew tense,\nthe messages increasingly threatening. \u201cYou should be more careful about how\nyou talk to people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t just smile at people like that.\u201d\nI never responded to any of the calls.\n\nAt work he began to berate me in front of customers and coworkers for small\nthings\u2014I had not refilled the coffee carafes quickly enough, the milk\ncontainers were empty. He manipulated my schedule so that I always worked\nalone. He stood beside me while I worked, not saying anything, not even\nlooking at me, just keeping his large body close to mine. When I spoke to\nanother manager about it, he said I should let it go. It wasn\u2019t a big deal;\nthe guy was just working out his hurt feelings. He said I shouldn\u2019t have\nsmiled at him like that.\n\nThat first, incredibly lonely year, I made one friend, a straight woman named\nKate who worked with me in the coffee shop. She had grown up in the city and\nhad a group of friends with whom we got drunk on Saturday nights in the woods\nof Golden Gate Park, in someone\u2019s apartment, or in someone\u2019s parents\u2019 garage.\nShe told me about her eating disorder and I told her about how I\u2019d made the\nmoney to move.\n\nBradley was one of her friends. He belonged to a group of boys who I only ever\nsaw together. One of them had a credit card. At some point after we met, they\nused it to pay to see me naked on the internet. On that day or soon after,\nBradley told his friends that he was going to have sex with me. \u201cHe wants to\nfuck you,\u201d one of them said. This was the way things were. If a boy said he\nwanted to fuck you, you were supposed to feel flattered.\n\nI felt mostly alone. I was tired all the time. I could not see how my life was\ngoing to progress beyond making rent and passing my few free hours drinking\nwith people I didn\u2019t know very well.\n\nOne night, at someone\u2019s apartment, I got drunk. If this were a movie, I was\nfollowing the plot exactly. I wore red lipstick and tight pants and when\nBradley handed me a red plastic Solo cup of unidentifiable liquor, I drank it.\nThen I drank another one. I danced with another girl. We rubbed our bodies\ntogether and the boys looked at us and we let them. I drank more and I danced\nmore, and I got very drunk and I went into a bedroom and lay down on someone\u2019s\nbed and fell asleep.\n\nI\u2019ve heard other people tell the stories of their rapes: time stopped, or\nthere was a clock in the room and they watched it, or it seemed to go on\nforever. That was not my experience. I woke up and it was happening. He was on\ntop of me and there was some pain, and it was very dark and everything was\nheavy and I could not move and I could smell him and I still smell him, and\nthen it was over. I believed immediately that it was my fault. I was drunk and\npassing in and out of consciousness. Eventually, some weak, gray light came in\nthrough the window. His body was there on the bed. I stood up, carefully put\nmy pants on, and carefully left. I rode the city bus back to the house I had\nlied to live in. I carefully showered, made a cup of coffee, and began the\nwork of pretending it had not happened.\n\nA year passed before I quit my job at the coffee shop and went back to doing\nsex work. By that time I was broke and exhausted and had a permanent shoulder\ninjury from working the big steaming machines. One morning, another manager\nwrote me up for clocking in three minutes late. I took two of the free weekly\npapers into the back room and began to answer the back-page ads.\n\nThey said things like: Wanted: women age 18\u201322, make $$$ fast, no experience\nnecessary, must be height-weight proportional. All the ads said that\u2014height-\nweight proportional\u2014as though it had some objective meaning.\n\nI called the numbers at the bottom of the ads and tried to tell whether the\nmen on the other end would hurt me. I was listening for something\u2014too much\nurgency, too much desire or too little. Most of the time I went to meet them.\nI waited at a bus stop or a train station, where a car pulled up and a voice\ncalled out the name that I had made up for myself. I looked through the window\nto see whether the men inside were mean. I had this suspicion that I could\ntell by looking at them, which is how you can tell if men are mean in the\nmovies. But in real life men can behave very well for a while and then\nsuddenly hurt you and then behave well again. I knew this but was ignoring it.\nI had rent to pay. I got in the car and eyed the locks, checked the door\nhandles, considered my escape.\n\nMost of the time the men were fine. Most of the time they were profoundly\nboring. I went to their warehouses or their apartments and put on whatever\npleated skirt they\u2019d bought for the occasion. I put things inside of me:\ncocks, knife handles, fruit, toys. Afterward I cleaned myself up in the\nbathroom and rinsed my mouth, got my money, and got a ride back to the station\nand took the bus home.\n\nIn California and in New Hampshire, the law distinguishes between pornography\nand prostitution, the idea being that there\u2019s a difference between paying\nsomeone for a sexual performance and paying someone for a sexual service.\nCatharine MacKinnon famously argued that to draw this distinction \u201cis to deny\nthe obvious: when you make pornography of a woman you make a prostitute out of\nher.\u201d In a memo supporting their anti-pornography ordinance of 1983, MacKinnon\nand Andrea Dworkin wrote that pornography\u2019s meaning is \u201cthe graphic depiction\nof whores.\u201d Their intention was to make people feel the same aversion to\npornography they presumably felt to prostitution, an aversion largely based on\nthe legal status of each industry. Hateful as their language is, in practice,\nthe content of their statement was accurate: the legal distinction between\npornography and prostitution is fallacious. I usually worked with a camera in\nthe room. That didn\u2019t mean that the content of my work was performance rather\nthan service. Those lines were not clear then, and they were not clear later,\nwhen I worked for men in rooms without cameras. I always performed. I usually\nprovided a service.\n\nInstead of distinguishing between pornography and prostitution, MacKinnon drew\na different line. \u201cMost of the time,\u201d she wrote of women in pornography, \u201cthe\nsex they are shown having is with someone they have no sexual interest in,\ndoing things that do nothing for them sexually . . . . They certainly never\nmeaningfully consent to be intimately accessible to the thousands or millions\nof men they are then sold to.\u201d For MacKinnon, money gives clarity to the\nexchange: \u201cThrowing money at victims of sexual abuse does not make it a job,\ntaking pictures of it does not make it freely chosen or desired. It makes it\npictures of paid rape\u2014rape in the real, if regrettably seldom in the legal,\nsense.\u201d\n\nEven in those early years I knew the work was not how anti-sex-work feminists\ndescribed it. I knew it was as good and as terrible as other, lower-wage work\nI\u2019d done. I knew, too, how quickly people stopped listening when they began to\nfeel pity. So I pretended. I pretended all of it was a kind of adventure. That\nwhat I gained from it was more than rent. I dismissed how much that rent meant\nto me. I pretended that I was not so poor, that I had not grown up poor. That\nI had not cried out of fear of not knowing where the money would come from\nnext. That I did not steal food from every restaurant I ever worked in. That I\nnever ate the food people left on their plates. That I did not watch movies\nabout \u201ccollege kids\u201d with a gripping, painful yearning in every part of my\nbody. That I did not come home from every sex-work job giddy at the\npossibility of ordering more takeout Chinese food than I could eat, giddy at\nhaving enough money to commit the thrill of waste.\n\nBut I also knew that the idea that I was \u201cempowered\u201d by trading sex was a lie.\nIn the early 2000s, as some sex workers were organizing and holding public\nevents in San Francisco, calling on queers and whores to unlearn our\nshame\u2014intimating that it was our responsibility to the movements to unlearn\nour shame\u2014I struggled with mine. There were days when men paid me less than\nthey\u2019d promised and I took it and said nothing. There were days when men\nwheedled me into something extra that I\u2019d have charged more for if I\u2019d been\nbetter at negotiating. There were days when men intentionally crossed every\nboundary I\u2019d tried to set, and I felt ashamed that I had not stopped them. I\nfelt shame when I didn\u2019t want to go to a job I\u2019d booked, when, instead of\ngoing to work, I sat down on the floor of my apartment and watched the phone\nring. I admired the women I saw speaking in public, admired what looked to me\nlike their power. I tried to mimic them, and there were moments when I thought\nI could. But more often, the ideal of the unashamed, empowered whore\u2014the sex\nworker of the liberal imagination\u2014was discouragingly unreachable to me.\n\nAt one point a woman I was dating told me she\u2019d called one of my regulars and\ngone to his house to masturbate for him. She told me the story as though we\nnow had a shared experience. I could tell from her voice that breaking the\nsocial prohibition against being naked with strangers and being paid for it\nhad given her a sense of freedom. This is, I think, what many sex workers and\n\u201csex-positive\u201d feminists mean when they talk about empowerment. But when she\ntold me the story, I felt ashamed again. I didn\u2019t yet know that what I was\nfeeling was class shame. I did sex work for the same reason I had always done\nwage labor: because I needed the money. There was no glorifying that.\n\nAnd yet I knew that needing the money did not feel the same as not choosing. I\nknew that taking off my clothes in middle-aged men\u2019s basements and condos did\nnot feel the same as being raped felt.\n\nIn 2003, the BDSM porn company I was working for took me to a weeklong\nconvention in Las Vegas, where I roomed with a woman from San Francisco,\nJessica. She loaned me her expensive shoes and together we walked through the\ncasinos, elevated in our six-inch heels. She kept her body long, back\nstraight, and eyes forward as she walked, and I watched as people\u2019s stares\nslid right off her. Together in her shoes, we ate in the kinds of restaurants\nI had only ever bused tables in, where neon strip lights shimmered against\nplate glass and the knives on the white tablecloths shone under the low light\nof what, in my memory, were chandeliers\u2014though in retrospect the restaurants\nwere merely faux-fancy chains. She taught me how to wear makeup and I emulated\nher walk, her way of acting like she didn\u2019t need men. She was good at setting\nboundaries, and I learned from watching her. Sometimes she was all business,\njust straight up \u201cno.\u201d Sometimes she said, \u201cWhat if instead we do this other\nthing?\u201d Sometimes she just laughed if someone asked her to do something she\ndidn\u2019t want to do, as though she thought they were joking\u2014and it worked. Men\nwould pretend they\u2019d been kidding.\n\nAfter the convention I began to travel to work for some of the men I\u2019d met\nthere. In 2005, a man I\u2019d never met asked me to fly to another country to\nshoot for him. As soon as I saw him, I knew he was mean. He took me to the\nhotel where I would be staying and sat in the room with me, quietly smoking. I\nwas with another performer I knew, but not well. We eyed each other. That week\nwe shot BDSM scenes that were far more difficult than we\u2019d negotiated. He\nwanted me to cry. He told me, smiling, that if I\u2019d just cry the scene would\nend. They caned me and put needles in my skin, but I physically could not cry.\nHe stayed with us nearly every minute of each day, exhaling in our faces a\ncloud of burnt tobacco. I remember thinking: I am here to work illegally. Who\nwould I tell? At the end of the week he wouldn\u2019t pay us. He said he\u2019d mail the\ncheck. When he finally did, the amount was half of what we\u2019d agreed on.\n\nThis was border crossing, force, fraud, and coercion\u2014trafficking in the most\nagreed-upon sense\u2014but I didn\u2019t think of it that way for years. Back home, I\nfelt I couldn\u2019t talk about what had happened. I knew it would be used to\novershadow my understanding of other experiences at work, and I felt\nhumiliated at having been tricked. A good whore, I thought, would at least\nhave gotten her money. Years later, I texted with a friend about this. \u201cNo,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cA good whore always tries to get her money.\u201d\n\nBy 2006, Jessica had started working for a man named Ron Kazlin. She called me\nfrom his car and put me on speaker. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d he said. \u201cThat little\nLorelei? Yeah, I\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d Later I learned he called all his girls\nthis: little Jessica, little Lili, little Paige. The next time Jessica came up\nto San Francisco for a shoot, she opened her daybook, pointed her glossy\nacrylics at each of the dates, and read aloud the amounts she\u2019d written into\nthem. \u201cMarch 13: $1,000. March 16: $1,400. March 20: $1,000.\u201d It was so much\nmoney.\n\nThat summer I called Kaz. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll get you work. But you gotta do what\nyou say you\u2019ll do. You say you\u2019ll do anal, you say you\u2019ll do DP, you do it.\nYou don\u2019t show up to set and tell them you don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d I sent him my\npictures, got a test, flew to LA, and worked. Within two weeks of that phone\ncall I had moved into his apartment. After that, I lived with Kaz for two to\nthree weeks every month. For the next few years I only worked through him.\n\nBetween three and six women crashed with Kaz at any given time. Others came by\nand stayed all day. We were his girls. We called his place the porn dorm or\nporno boot camp. I slept on the couch and followed Kaz\u2019s rules: rules about\nhow late we could be out of the apartment, rules about who we could date. We\nwere not allowed to do drugs. We were not allowed to be late to set. Kazlin\ngirls showed up on time and did the job we were hired to do. We had a good\nattitude, even when we were exhausted and even when we were booked with\nsomeone we did not like. We had a good attitude even at the eleventh hour of a\ntwelve-hour shoot, when we were dehydrated and sore and drenched in sweat and\nJake Malone wanted us to start a whole new scene, wanted latex opera gloves\nand squirt off the second-floor landing. We had a good attitude even at 2 AM\nwhen Kaz finally picked us up from the Jay Sin shoot, when we were just\nbeginning to comb the crusts of cum from our hair in the car, and Kaz told us\nwe were booked for an anal scene at Combat Zone in four hours. When I did not\nhave a good attitude, when I cried from exhaustion, Kaz said, \u201cYou\u2019ll cry when\nyou have no money. Go to work.\u201d And I went.\n\nI went even when I didn\u2019t want to, and even when I had plenty of cash in the\nbank, simply because I didn\u2019t want Kaz to get mad at me. If you have never had\nsex for money, it might be easy to see this as a story about coercion and\nconsent instead of a story about work. It would have been much better if I\u2019d\nbeen rich and could have worked only when I wanted to. It would have been much\nworse if I\u2019d had no work at all.\n\nThe truth is, I was safe with Kaz. There were days when the work was\nuncomfortable or boring or more physically demanding than I wanted. Days when\nI hated my scene partner, when I held my breath and turned my face from their\nface. There were also days when I felt like I had made art or won a race or\nboth. When my body moved with a kind of fluidity that felt like singing. Days\nwhen I had seven ideas in a row, mid-shoot, and my scene partner followed me\nor I followed them in a perfect give-and-take like we were dancing, like we\nwere experts of movement, which we were. There were days when my scene\npartners were people I cared deeply about, people with whom I had shared meals\nand birthdays and long talks and intimacies of all kinds, whom I knew so well\nthat a few hours into a scene, the director, the cameraman, and the production\nassistant just stood there, awed by the brilliant communications of our\nbodies. With Kaz I never had to lower my rates or acquiesce when the director\ntried to ask for something extra. If someone tried something on set, Kaz took\ncare of it.\n\nMany of the other porn performers who lived with Kaz were also trading sex on\nthe side\u2014\u201cdoing privates,\u201d we called it. They taught me every way to do an\nenema and how to avoid the director when he\u2019s trying to get you to blow him\nbetween takes and your jaw needs a rest. They told me who to put on my \u201cno\u201d\nlist, who would try to cut my rate, and who would just keep me waiting all day\nwhile they got high with their friends. Many of these women were from other\ncountries. When a man knocked on the apartment door and said \u201cUPS,\u201d they heard\n\u201cINS,\u201d and ran and hid in the closet. Many of them had exit plans: they were\nsaving enough for a house or a boob job, or they were shooting to make their\nname so they could feature dance or increase their private rate. A few were\ntrying to transition into mainstream film or music. Many of them were career\nperformers whom I\u2019d continue to work with for the next ten-plus years.\n\nDuring that time I had less and less contact with anyone who was not a sex\nworker. I kept my room in San Francisco but forgot how to talk to civilians.\nIt had already been difficult, years before, when people at parties and bars\ntried to act cool around me by suddenly talking about sex or pornography in a\nway that pretended to be casual. They relied on me to respond in a way that\napproved of them, that made them feel edgy or in. They wanted the veneer of\nassociation without any of the consequences. Sometimes young leftist men would\nlook at me with sad faces; they wanted to talk for an hour about whether I and\nthe other women were all right. They wanted to know which kind of strip club\nit was \u201cOK\u201d to go to and which was the bad kind. People constantly asked for\nfree memberships or DVDs.\n\nSometimes when people asked me what I did and I told them, the conversation\nsimply ended. Their faces changed and they couldn\u2019t meet my eyes anymore.\n\nWith strangers at the airport or the bank, I called myself a model or an\nindependent contractor, which I\u2019d learned to say from other sex workers.\nSometimes on housing applications I pretended I had rich parents. I\u2019d print\nout my bank statement, highlight the deposits, and tell the landlord my\nparents gave me the money. Once, when I opened a bank account and put \u201cmodel\u201d\nas my occupation, the teller would not let it go. Would he see me on any\nbillboards? Had I traveled to exotic places to shoot? Did I know anyone\nfamous? Finally, I told him, \u201cI make pornography.\u201d He took a beat and then\nsaid, \u201cWell, whatever pays the bills, right?\u201d\n\nI heard that all the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got bills to pay,\u201d or, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to\nmake rent somehow,\u201d or, my favorite, \u201cWell, we\u2019re all whores in one way or\nanother.\u201d That one made me angriest. People assumed my job was terrible and\nthen patted themselves on the back for telling me my job was less terrible\nthan they assumed. It reminded me that my job would always, in one way or\nanother, mark me as different.\n\nBy the time I was working with Kaz, I was making so much pornography that I\nwas beginning to be recognized, which made it harder for me to imagine doing\nanything else. I thought a lot about what it would be like to not be a whore.\nI wondered whether, if I stopped, I would be allowed into what seemed to me\nlike the glass room civilians lived in. I could see it everywhere around me,\nbut I didn\u2019t know how to get in.\n\nBy 2007, I increasingly felt the weight of public, social, and familial\ncondemnation. I was tired from working long days and had little control over\nwhen and how I worked. I had been told so many times, in so many ways, that\nbeing a person who trades sex meant my life had no value. I was afraid it\nmight be true. I felt both cut off from the larger world and that it\u2019d be\ndangerous, physically and psychically, to try to interact with civilians.\nAround that time, I received an email from Shelley Lubben.\n\nLubben had traded sex for a number of years in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s\nbefore being, in her own words, \u201crescued\u201d by an evangelical man she later\nmarried (\u201ca friend to a prostitute, just like Jesus,\u201d she said). After leaving\nthe industry, she devoted herself to \u201crescuing\u201d other women, eventually\nfounding the Pink Cross Foundation. Many of her claims were extreme or\noffensive: that God had cured her of herpes and cancer, that all women in the\nsex industry had been molested as children, that watching pornography would\nlead to bestiality. Her email, however, suggested little of that. Lubben wrote\nto me as though she knew me. In my memory, she said she thought I was smart,\nthat I had potential, and that I was meant for greater things. (I\u2019ve since\nlearned that she wrote this to everyone.) Lubben invited me to go on an MTV\nreality show where she\u2019d pay me to be publicly saved. I knew other girls who\u2019d\nbeen \u201csaved\u201d by her, and they\u2019d made testimonial videos where they cried and\ntalked about how they\u2019d been transformed.\n\nFor days, I contemplated Lubben\u2019s email. I knew how difficult it would be to\ngo back to school or apply for non-adult jobs when I had little other work\nexperience and little hope of hiding my years of adult film work. I was not\nlooking for a religious conversion, but I wanted desperately to walk through\nthe world as the kind of person civilians could see. I wanted a way to escape\nthe weight of stigma. Lubben pretended to offer that.\n\nI let the days pass and didn\u2019t respond. Later I heard stories about how Lubben\nlet down the women she promised to support. She held fundraisers but didn\u2019t\ngive the funds to the women she\u2019d claimed to be helping. Some went back to\ntheir parents, some took minimum-wage jobs. Most of them, as far as I could\ntell, came back to sex work eventually. A friend of mine who got saved and\nthen came back just rolled her eyes when we talked about it. She called it her\n\u201ccrazy for Jesus\u201d moment.\n\nLubben\u2019s approach was representative of the rescue industry. Nicholas Kristof\nlive-tweets brothel raids and gets paid by the New York Times to write about\nit. The former police officer and pastor Kevin Brown leveraged his \u201crescue\nmissions\u201d into a reality TV show on A&E called 8 Minutes, for how long he\nbelieved it would take him to \u201cliberate\u201d sex workers from \u201ca life of\nservitude.\u201d On the show, Brown pretended to be a client and then ambushed\nwomen with TV cameras when they arrived for work. The ambushes were staged,\nbut the exploitation of vulnerable workers was not. In 2015, sex workers and\nwriters Alana Massey and Bubbles described how Brown and A&E failed to provide\nthe support they promised the women they\u2019d convinced to go on the show. One of\nthese women, Kamylla, described waiting weeks after filming until her rent was\npast due. She was facing final eviction notices, and she could no longer wait.\nShe posted an ad using the same number she\u2019d used when she was contacted by\nthe producers of 8 Minutes. She was subsequently arrested in a police sting.\n\nRescuing women from the sex trades is an old business. In San Francisco in\n1910, a woman named Donaldina Cameron made it her job to join police on\nbrothel raids to \u201crescue\u201d Chinese immigrant sex workers and take them into her\nmission home, called Nine-twenty. At Nine-twenty, the women were made to cook\nand clean and sew in preparation for being good Christian wives. Staff read\nall incoming and outgoing mail. Many of the rescued women escaped their\nrescuers.\n\nSeven years later, the Methodist reverend Paul Smith delivered a series of\nsermons calling for a shutdown of the red-light district in the uptown\nTenderloin neighborhood. In response, three hundred brothel workers marched to\nthe Central Methodist church to confront him. Reverend Smith told the women\nthey could make $10 a week working as domestics. The women told him $10 would\nbuy a single pair of shoes. He asked how many would be willing to do\nhousework. They said, \u201cWhat woman wants to work in a kitchen?\u201d\n\nNot all anti-trafficking activists and organizations are part of the rescue\nindustry. Trafficking-survivor activists like Meg Mu\u00f1oz, Kate Zen, and Laura\nLeMoon and anti-trafficking advocates like Kate D\u2019Adamo work to connect people\nto resources without coercion. They condemn the rescue industry and advocate\nfor policies that help victims of violence without harming other people in the\nsex trades. The Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women is an international\ncoalition of organizations working to address exploitation by strengthening\nlabor rights, supporting safer migration, providing social services, opposing\ndiscrimination against people in the sex trades, and explicating the failures\nof criminal justice approaches.\n\nThe best anti-exploitation work is being done by those of us with experience\ntrading sex. Too often, that work looks like showing up for one another when\nlegal and social systems utterly fail us. Kamylla described how after she was\narrested, the people who finally offered her concrete support were the other\nwomen she was locked up with, who had also been arrested on prostitution\ncharges. \u201cThey were helping me reach my family outside,\u201d she said, \u201cusing\ntheir credits to call people who could reach my husband.\u201d\n\nIn the decade or so since online advertising and social media have become\nwidely available, people in the sex trades have developed online networks for\nsharing information about client screening and safer work methods, lists of\npotentially dangerous clients, and information about what kind of legislation\nor police stings are happening in what cities, where community meetings and\nrallies and protests are being held, and who has extra cash this month and who\nneeds it. All this information has been lifesaving. Also lifesaving has been\nour ability to simply connect with each other, to find others with shared\nexperiences, to talk across distances about familial and social rejection, to\ndream together about what love and labor and solidarity could look like in a\nworld where trading sex makes most people view you as disposable.\n\n> The things that sex workers do to stay safe are almost always the things\n> civilians want to pass laws to stop.\n>\n> Tweet\n\nBut whatever community coalitions we build, whatever work we do to speak about\nour own lives even when it is dangerous to do so, our voices will continue to\nbe ignored if what we\u2019re trying to say doesn\u2019t fit into preexisting\nnarratives. Not only have the legal and cultural frameworks of the past two\ndecades shaped the public meaning of our work, caricaturing us as permanent\nvictims or as \u201cempowered\u201d businesswomen (and in these narratives, we are\nalways \u201cwomen\u201d); they have shaped our ability to even point out their faulty\npremises.\n\nIn the radical narrative, all sex trading is understood as trafficking and our\nability to consent does not exist. In the competing liberal-libertarian\nnarrative, those of us who have been publicly described as having \u201cconsented\u201d\nto our work are categorically characterized as \u201cempowered,\u201d as \u201cchoice\nfeminists.\u201d Under these constructs, we have only two options: to be victims,\nwhich means we need to be rescued from our work\u2014even if that rescue happens in\nhandcuffs\u2014or to be empowered sex workers, which means saying we\u2019ve never\nexperienced violence or constrained choice, that we love our jobs all day\nevery day, and to be free we only need access to the free market. (As the\nactivist Kaya Lin has said, \u201cIf you are a sex worker, you can\u2019t have bad\ndays.\u201d) In terms of policy, these positions translate quite literally into the\nthreat of being jailed versus the possibility of surviving using the methods\nwe already use. The threat of further criminalization has pushed many people\nto publicly embrace the latter\u2014to say, \u201cI love doing sex work. I only want the\nstate to leave me alone.\u201d Often that seems like the most we could hope for.\n\nEven as we reach for the less terrible of two terrible ideas, we\u2019re constantly\nreminded of how little say we have at all. Neither liberal feminists nor\nlibertarians, radical feminists nor the religious right, can hear us speak in\nour own words. They do not want to hear us; they want to collect the scraped-\nbare \u201cfacts\u201d of our lives and call them data. They want to interrogate us. Who\ndid you work for? How young were you? Do you have papers? Do you have\nchildren? Do you have parents? Have you been to school? Do you speak English?\nWhat are your traumas? Who hurt you? Do you love it? Do you really love it?\nHow much do you love it? During a recent visit I made to a law school class, a\nstudent asked me, \u201cIs there a level of poverty at which a woman can\u2019t\nconsent?\u201d\n\nAgain and again in my own life, people have demanded to know what has been\ndone to me, how I was exploited, what kind of trauma or poverty pushed me into\nbelieving I had no other options than to trade sex. Or they have asked to hear\nabout how trading sex has been my pathway to empowerment, to sexual adventure.\nThey have asked me to slot my experiences neatly into one story line or\nanother, or demanded I hand over the facts of my life so they could do it for\nme.\n\nIn 2014, when the California State assemblyman Isadore Hall authored a bill to\nmandate the use of condoms as well as state-recorded testing of performers in\nadult films, my coworkers and I took buses and trains up to the state capitol\nto testify against the bill. The elaborate, community-driven testing regimen\nwe relied on had prevented even a single on-set transmission of HIV since\n2004, and it would be seriously undermined by the proposed legislation.\nPerhaps worse, Hall\u2019s bill would have created a state registry of performers\u2019\nlegal names and health information. We gathered the signatures of more than\nsix hundred performers, a thick ream of paper that I carried clutched to my\nchest, shielding my body from the Senate Appropriations Committee with this\nphysical evidence of our collective will. I remember Hall testifying to the\ncommittee that he had written this bill because someone needed to be \u201ca voice\nfor the voiceless,\u201d and that person would be him. I sat beside him at a podium\nmicrophone. My coworkers stood in a long line at a microphone behind him,\nwaiting for him to stop so we could speak.\n\nIn 2015, Amnesty International circulated an internal draft policy on sex work\nfor consideration at their International Council Meeting in Dublin that\nAugust. The draft policy called for the decriminalization of all sex work.\nWhen word of it reached the public, many Hollywood actresses signed a letter\nto Amnesty International opposing the policy. The letter, written by the\nCoalition Against Trafficking in Women, framed legal sex work as \u201clicense to\npurchase women.\u201d It said that \u201cregardless of how a woman ends up in the sex\ntrade\u201d she suffers \u201clifelong physical and psychological harm.\u201d It claimed that\ndecriminalization would \u201csupport a system of gender apartheid, in which one\ncategory of women may gain protection from sexual violence and sexual\nharassment . . . while another category of women . . . are instead set apart\nfor consumption by men and for the profit of their pimps, traffickers and\nbrothel owners.\u201d\n\nWhat the signers didn\u2019t say was that criminalization does the same thing. When\ntrading sex is made illegitimate, the people who do it are also made\nillegitimate. Criminalization increases barriers to safety in every\nform\u2014housing, health care, child care and parental rights, and familial and\nsocial support. We live, here and now, in a country in which trading sex is\nmore criminalized than in nearly any other country on earth, and where sex\nworkers have little legal recourse when we\u2019re assaulted. When we\u2019re assaulted,\nunder criminalization, we have to weigh the possibility that going to the\npolice will mean being arrested. If we go to the police, they can refuse to\ninvestigate our rapes. Often the police themselves are our rapists.\n\nWhen the women of Hollywood began to talk about Harvey Weinstein in 2017, I\nfelt sick for a long time. I avoided social media. I stopped listening to the\nnews. I went back to social media, but muted the words rape, raped, and rapist\non Twitter. Still I saw the hashtag again and again. On the red carpet, I saw\nMira Sorvino and Ashley Judd talk about \u201can equitable and safe world for\nwomen.\u201d They said, \u201cWe women, our voices have been squelched.\u201d I couldn\u2019t\nlisten to them without a deep and swelling rage.\n\nI remember Ashley Judd writing on Twitter, \u201cIt is essential, and is not anti\nsex, to expose pornography\u2019s complicit role in child abuse & trafficking.\u201d I\nremember Mira Sorvino, UNODC Goodwill Ambassador to Combat Human Trafficking,\nsaying that \u201cprostitution breeds sex trafficking.\u201d Later in Time magazine,\nSorvino wrote, \u201cI am here to encourage a mass speaking-out.\u201d She wrote that\nher fear of speaking about her own experiences left her \u201ccrying and shaking,\u201d\nthat she woke at 2 AM and couldn\u2019t fall back to sleep. I was extremely\nfamiliar with that fear.\n\nFor many years I didn\u2019t tell anyone I had been raped. Besides the usual\nreasons, I didn\u2019t tell anyone because I knew how sex workers\u2019 experiences of\nsexual violence are rewritten by anti-sex-work feminists as reasons we work in\nthe sex trades, whether we describe them that way or not. For years I never\ntalked publicly about my experiences of violence and coercion while doing sex\nwork because I knew how these stories would be weaponized. After #MeToo was\nco-opted from Tarana Burke, when wealthy white women like Sorvino and Judd\nmade themselves its public face, I thought: These women encouraging a mass\nspeaking-out are the same people making it impossible for me to speak.\n\nWhen feminists call for the criminalization and delegitimization of sex work,\nthey do not ally themselves with sex-working women. They actively create and\ncultivate a world in which sex-working women are culturally, legally, and\nvisibly separated from women who do not trade sex. They make sure that they\nwill not be mistaken for one of us, and they do so by telling a story about\nour lives that is about predators and not about work. A story in which the\npower dynamics are utterly uncomplicated and so are the solutions.\n\nIn 2018, on a phone call with the ACLU, I was asked about labor protections\nfor adult-film performers. I said: You have to recognize how complicated this\nis. The things that sex workers do to stay safe are almost always the things\ncivilians want to pass laws to stop. Everything looks different depending on\nthe distance from which you\u2019re looking.\n\nIn the lead-up to FOSTA\u2019s passing into law, major websites and apps like\nCraigslist and Instagram began to ban sex workers from their platforms,\nshutting down spaces where we advertised and organized. Those of us who had\ndone visible organizing and advocacy received numerous phone calls and\nrequests for help. People in the sex trades had suddenly lost necessary income\nand were facing eviction, medical crises, and food insecurity. Workers who had\nbeen pushed offline moved to doing street-based work or went back to in-person\nclient-seeking in bars, casinos, and clubs, where negotiation is necessarily\nrushed and workers face higher risks of violence from both clients and police.\nMany workers heard from managers who had previously harmed them, saying, You\nneed me now. There was, and continues to be, widespread fear.\n\nIn hearings for FOSTA, congresspeople repeatedly claimed that the bill\u2019s\npassage was necessary to stop a scourge of what they called \u201cmodern-day\nslavery.\u201d A report from the House Judiciary Committee in February 2018 said,\n\u201cProstitution and sex trafficking are inextricably linked, and where\nprostitution is legalized or tolerated, there is a greater demand for human\ntrafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and\nchildren trafficked into commercial sex slavery.\u201d The following month, Senator\nBill Nelson (D-FL) made his impassioned case before the Senate:\n\n> Women and children are being forced into sex slavery in modern-day America.\n> It could very well happen to someone you know . . . . We have heard, over\n> and over, the untold stories of the inhumanity of stacking people body-to-\n> body in the holds of these slave ships. It finally took a civil war to\n> settle the issue. That was slavery. That was slavery we opposed and now all\n> of our laws try to protect against, but here in modern-day America, the same\n> thing is happening.\n\n\u201cThe slavery of black women is abolished in America; but the slavery of white\nwomen continues in Europe,\u201d Victor Hugo wrote in a letter to the white British\nfeminist Josephine Butler in 1870. The letter is frequently cited as the first\ntime trading sex was referred to as \u201cslavery.\u201d Butler took the language and\nran with it, writing that regulations governing legalized prostitution in\n19th-century Europe were \u201csimilar to the \u2018Fugitive Slave Law\u2019 which existed in\nAmerica.\u201d She claimed that those who advocated for legalized and regulated\nprostitution in Europe had a \u201cfixed determination to reduce women to a slavery\nmore complete than any which the earth has ever seen.\u201d Her rhetoric was taken\nup in the United States, where reformers who had been part of the antebellum\nabolitionist movement joined forces with anti-immigration activists, white\nfeminists, religious reformers, sensationalist journalists, and congresspeople\nto rail against a \u201cnew,\u201d and newly un-American, \u201cslavery.\u201d\n\nEven as the Black Codes and subsequent Jim Crow laws reinstituted a racialized\nsystem of forced labor that continues to this day, white Americans told\nthemselves that the country had entered a new age of freedom that was now\nunder threat from Chinese immigration. Chinese women who worked in gold\nrush\u2013era brothels in California were, claimed one reformer, \u201cinfusing a poison\ninto the Anglo-Saxon Blood.\u201d\n\nThe first law limiting immigration into the United States, the Page Act of\n1875, was a direct response to this rhetoric, prohibiting the \u201cimportation\ninto the United States of women for the purposes of prostitution.\u201d The Page\nAct also prohibited the entering into a contract by immigrants from China,\nJapan, or \u201cany Oriental country\u201d for \u201clewd and immoral purposes.\u201d The law\nresulted in the exclusion of almost all Chinese women from the US, a move that\nthe historian Jean Pfaelzer has described as ethnic cleansing.\n\nBy the turn of the century, the focus of \u201cnew slavery\u201d rhetoric had moved to\nthe supposed enslavement of white women for the purposes of forced\nprostitution. The end of the 1800s had been marked by increased\nindustrialization and movement of rural workers to urban centers, and the\narchetypal \u201cwhite slave\u201d of the early 1900s was a young farm girl who had been\nlured into prostitution after leaving her family and living alone in a\nboardinghouse in the city. The same time period saw the construction of race\nas genetic and hereditary, and fears of white women\u2019s \u201censlavement\u201d in\nbrothels were fears of interracial sex and miscegenation. In 1909, the US\nattorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Edwin W. Sims, claimed that\n\u201cwhite slavery\u201d was \u201ca system operated by a syndicate which has its\nramifications from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific ocean, with \u2018clearing\nhouses\u2019 or \u2018distributing centers\u2019 in nearly all of the larger cities.\u201d In\n1910, Congress responded by passing the White-Slave Traffic Act, also called\nthe Mann Act, which prohibited the transportation of women and girls \u201cin\ninterstate or foreign commerce . . . for the purpose of prostitution of\ndebauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\u201d The Mann Act, which was largely\nresponsible for the development of the FBI as a federal agency, is still very\nmuch a part of the US Code. The most substantial part of FOSTA is simply an\namendment to the Mann Act.\n\nThis rewriting of slavery as a harm to white men and women ignored the role\nthat rape and sexual violence played in the systemic enslavement of African\nAmericans. The rape of enslaved African American women was not, legally, a\ncrime, and scholars like Andrea Ritchie and Angela Davis have described how\nrape and sexual assault were an \u201cessential dimension,\u201d in Davis\u2019s words, \u201cof\nthe social relations between slavemaster and slave.\u201d Also ignored in the\nnational moral panic around \u201cmodern slavery\u201d were the experiences of Black\nwomen working in the Progressive Era sex trades. As Cynthia Blair describes,\nmiddle-class African Americans during this time were vocally critical of the\nnational campaign that neglected Black brothel workers. In 1920, the civil\nrights activist Irene McCoy Gaines remarked on the irony of a rescue campaign\nfocused exclusively on white women, who had greater access to other forms of\nemployment, when Black girls and women received \u201cless protection from public\nopinion than from the law.\u201d While Black women in the sex trades went\nunmentioned in national debates among whites, they then (as today) bore the\nbrunt of anti-prostitution activist pressure on police, who responded by\nconducting raids on brothels where Black women worked, demanding bribes and\nprotection money. By 1915, despite the recent passage of a federal law to\n\u201cprotect women,\u201d Black women arrested for trading sex were given increasingly\nharsh penalties by municipal judges. By 1924, Blair writes, Black women\n\u201cconsistently composed more than half of all women arrested for working in a\nhouse of prostitution.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that in 2019, both sex work and reparations are issues\non the presidential campaign trail. The roots of these issues are deeply\nintertwined, and calling trading sex \u201cmodern slavery\u201d only ensures that we\nwill never reckon with the lasting impact of the institutionalized, lawful\nenslavement of African and African American people in the United States.\nMeanwhile, the racism encoded in anti-trafficking legislation and rhetoric is\nstill alive. In November 2018, in an address on border and immigration\ncontrol, President Trump said, \u201cThey steal women. The human traffickers, the\nlowest scum on Earth.\u201d\n\nI have worked for \u201cart photographers\u201d and I have worked for \u201cpornographers.\u201d I\nhave worked for \u201ccollege students doing a business project.\u201d I\u2019ve talked to\nmen through email and I\u2019ve talked to men on the phone. I\u2019ve sat in a foam-\nstone warehouse \u201cdungeon\u201d to talk through a scene both before and after it\nhappened. I\u2019ve had conversation after conversation about what, exactly, I was\nwilling to do with my body. In my experience, the people who call their work\npornography, in addition to paying better than the \u201cart photographers,\u201d are\nmore direct and clear in these conversations (something MacKinnon and Dworkin\ndidn\u2019t seem to consider when they carved out an exception in their ordinance\nfor \u201cerotica,\u201d which they defined as \u201csexually explicit sex premised on\nequality\u201d). In my early years of working, when I showed up at a studio, a\nwarehouse, or an apartment and a director asked, \u201cWhat do you want to do\ntoday?\u201d I had to learn how to come up with an answer. No one in my private\nlife had ever asked me a question like that. What we were doing, of course,\nwas negotiating consent.\n\nI\u2019ve been told that my story is unrepresentative \u2014 that anyone who does not\nwant to be \u201crescued\u201d from sex work is too much of an outlier to base policy\ndecisions on. I\u2019ve also been told that I\u2019m \u201cvery articulate for someone with\nyour experience\u201d \u2014 that I\u2019m too articulate and thus too privileged to be\nallowed to articulate myself. I\u2019ve also been told that I\u2019m too traumatized, or\ntoo brainwashed, to understand my own experiences. One member of the\nCalifornia State Assembly listened to everything I had to say and then\nreplied, \u201cYou seem smart, but they aren\u2019t all like you.\u201d Let me be clear:\nEvery sex worker I have ever met is as smart as I am; many are smarter. I have\nlearned more, collectively, from my coworkers than from any of the formal\neducation I\u2019ve bought with my hard-earned sex-work dollars.\n\nOver the years, and especially since #MeToo, I\u2019ve had many conversations with\nmy coworkers about what it means to trade sex under circumstances that are\ncoercive but not forced \u2014 circumstances under which we did things\nintentionally but did not choose in the sense academic feminists usually mean.\nHow do we describe our lives without neglecting the fact that we have\nexperienced both violence and joy at work? How do we talk about those extremes\nwithout ignoring the pragmatic day-to-day of it all, the profound boredom of\nwashing and folding sheets between sessions, of listening to wealthy middle-\naged men boast, of surreptitiously checking our watches while fucking, of all\nthe tasks that we are paid for that have nothing to do with sex and have so\nmuch in common with other forms of service work? How do we talk about our\nexperiences without letting their meaning be stolen?\n\nAs the sex worker, artist, and theorist suprihmb\u00e9 said to me while we tried to\nfind terms that fit our experiences, \u201cWe are somewhere in between.\u201d In her\nessay \u201cDefined/Definers,\u201d she writes about \u201cindirectly determin[ing]\u201d to do\nsex work. The intention of sex-worker activists who have embraced the\nchoice/coercion dichotomy, she writes,\n\n> is to draw firm lines between sex work and sex trafficking . . . to\n> circumvent or undermine sex trafficking legislation that targets independent\n> prostitutes and cyber prostitutes (erotic webcam models), and to stop people\n> from stereotyping sex workers as victims who need their kind of saving.\n> However, while doing it this way might protect sex workers who are actually\n> sex workers by choice, it does not protect the rest of us who fall into that\n> murky gray area in between.\n\nSimilarly, instead of talking about consent, sex workers Juno Mac and Molly\nSmith use the term \u201cdeliberate\u201d sex work: choosing is not the same as doing\nsomething deliberately. The migrant sex worker collective Red Canary Song,\nformed in the wake of Yang Song\u2019s death during a 2017 police raid on a Queens\nmassage parlor, describes its work as led by and for \u201cpeople who are trading\nsexual services for income or survival needs.\u201d The sex-work coalition Decrim\nNY, who this year introduced in New York state the most comprehensive\ndecriminalization bill in the country, describes their coalition as being made\nup of people who have traded sex out of \u201cchoice, coercion, or circumstance.\u201d\n\nWhile FOSTA may not actually do what congresspeople claim, it has made the\nessential conversations encouraged by people like suprihmb\u00e9, Juno Mac, Molly\nSmith, Red Canary Song, and Decrim NY extremely difficult to have in public.\nEven though FOSTA has not yet been used by attorneys or by law enforcement,\nthe law has had tremendous influence on the actions of private companies.^1\nMuch like the numerous \u201canti-trafficking\u201d laws that create third-party\nliability, FOSTA incentivizes private companies to exclude people who trade\nsex from public spaces and accommodations. Earlier this year, Marriott\nadmitted that their employees, having been through \u201canti-trafficking\ntraining,\u201d were profiling single women and asking them to leave their hotel\nbars. FOSTA does the same thing online. Congress calls us voiceless and then\ntakes away the spaces where we were speaking.\n\nWhen I say that moving to San Francisco saved my life, I mean that it was\nthere that I met other people who shared my experiences of sex, desire,\ngender, and identity. It was there that I learned a language through which I\ncould talk about the most difficult parts of my life. Most of the sex workers\nI met in San Francisco were working-class queers and trans men and women. They\nhelped me understand that what I was doing at work was putting on a show about\ngender. They taught me that the implements of traditional \u201cfemininity\u201d \u2014\nrather than being, as I had heard my whole life, symbols of weakness or ways\nto fail at gender \u2014 were tools we could wield without having to own them.\n\u201cFemininity\u201d was a combination of things we sometimes felt innately, sometimes\nconstructs we created to make money, and sometimes constructs we created to\ncreate ourselves. Untangling my gender from my \u201cfemininity\u201d made my queerness\na part of me that I could love. Loving my queer, poor, brilliant sex-worker\nfriends helped me know that I was whole and unbroken \u2014 allowed me to believe\nthat I, too, was deserving of love. Listening to them speak gave me my voice.\n\nOn June 2, 2018, sex workers gathered in Chicago, Las Vegas, Oakland, Los\nAngeles, New York City, Phoenix, and Washington DC for International Whores\u2019\nDay, commemorating the eight-day occupation of Saint-Nizier Church in Lyon by\nmore than one hundred sex workers protesting criminalization and police\nharassment in 1975. The rally I attended in New York City was meant to take\nplace in Christopher Park to honor the queer and trans sex workers of color\nwho are our whore-mothers, who refused to submit to police violence at\nStonewall nearly fifty years earlier, but the crowd swelled and continued to\nswell until we spilled into traffic. The organizers decided we should march to\nWashington Square. We took the streets and walked down West 4th Street\nchanting, brandishing our banners and signs. Four hundred of us crowded under\nthe arch. We made speeches about our rage at years of being sacrificed by\npolicymakers who see us as collateral damage, about our friends who had\nrecently been evicted, attacked, jailed, and killed. We envisioned a better\nfuture, and we held each other\u2019s grief and hope. Through call-and-response, we\nfour hundred voiceless repeated and amplified each other\u2019s words. We had no\nmicrophones, but we did not need them.\n\n  1. The DOJ has said that FOSTA actually makes it harder to prosecute websites for trafficking, and the only federal judge to rule on the law so far has said that the \u201cpromotes or facilitates\u201d language only creates liability identical to existing liability under the federal Travel Act . The Travel Act, notably, is the law that was used to shut down Backpage.com four days before FOSTA actually passed. A few attorneys bringing civil trafficking suits have claimed that they are bringing the suits based on changes to the law made by FOSTA, but these claims, while attracting media attention, aren\u2019t true. All suits thus far have been brought under preexisting state-level tort laws, to which FOSTA made no change in liability. \u21a9\n\nThis essay could not have been written without community-developed knowledge.\nAny mistakes are my own, and anything I got right is the result of living,\nworking, and thinking in coalition with hundreds of brilliant people in the\nsex trades.
