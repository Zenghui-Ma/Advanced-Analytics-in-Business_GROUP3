It also detects any frameworks / static libraries and checks if\nthey are included in the third-party SDK list that Apple has provided ^3.\n\nThe tool does not perform any sort of analysis beyond the simple line-by-line\ncheck for the existence of the method calls or symbols that Apple has already\npublished.\n\nThe tool uses a concurrent queue to speed up the parsing process.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either use the tool by typing: swift run privacy-manifest in the root\ndirectory of the project, or you can install the executable to /usr/local/bin\ndirectory so that you can call it from any folder.\n\nIn order to copy the executable, you can first build the project with swift\nbuild -c release and then copy it with cp .build/release/privacy-manifest\n/usr/local/bin/privacy-manifest.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installing the tool to the /usr/local/bin directory, you can invoke it\nfrom any directory using the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    privacy-manifest analyze --project path/to/project --reveal-occurrences --output path\n\nThe path/to/project can be a relative or an absolute path to the .xcodeproj or\nPackage.swift file of your project.\n\nThe --reveal-occurrences is an optional flag that displays extended\ninformation regarding the occurrences of the required reason APIs / privacy\ncollected data frameworks in your codebase, highlighting the file and the line\nwhere a call has been detected.\n\nThe --output flag is optional and if specified, a PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy\nproperty list file will be generated to that directory based on the detected\nrequired reason APIs and from the responses of the user.\n\n## Example\n\nBelow is the console output from the VLC iOS OSS.\n\n## Future implementations\n\nThe tool can output the occurrences report to HTML for better readability.\n\nOn top of that, the list of third-party crash frameworks can be updated so\nthat it can inform the user when such framework is detected (there is a\nrelated TODO in the code).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nDo not use this tool alone to create your privacy manifest file for your app\nor SDK. You must always double-check the occurrences that the tool displays as\nthe tool does not know whether a certain occurrence is included in a comment\nor on an unused piece of code. Furthermore, there might also be cases where\nsomething has not been included in the parsing process.\n\nThis tool gives you a high-level overview of the different required reason\nAPIs and privacy collected data frameworks your project, workspace or package\nuses, so always do your own research after using this tool, to confirm the\nfindings.\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under Apache License 2.0, see LICENSE file.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  1. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api \u21a9\n\n  2. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests). \u21a9\n\n  3. https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/ \u21a9\n\n## About\n\nA simple tool that parses your Xcode project/workspace or Swift Package,\ndetects required reason APIs and generates a Privacy Manifest if needed.\n\n### Topics\n\nmanifest apple privacy xcode\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nApache-2.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n117 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n4 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 15\n\nv0.0.15 Latest\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n\\+ 14 releases\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Swift 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
