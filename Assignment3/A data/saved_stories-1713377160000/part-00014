For some reason that I can't comprehend, web designers love to\nhighlight the \"Sign Up\" button and not the \"Log In\" button, communicating that\npotential users are more valuable than loyal, regular users. Here are some\nexamples:\n\nTwitter: 4 obvious ways to sign up, 1 unhighlighted way to log in\n\nHulu: Log in hidden behind the hamburger menu\n\nGitHub: 0 ways to log in, 2 ways to sign up\n\nGitLab: GitHub's competitor doing no better\n\n## Log In First\n\nSure, regular users are logged in most of the time they visit websites. But I\ncan't think of a single usability reason why not to make log in just as\napparent as sign up. It's a very mild inconvenience, but an avoidable one, so\nit shouldn't happen.\n\nLet's take a look at a good example:\n\nFacebook doesn't get a lot of praise nowadays, but this homepage is\nperfection. There is a clear way to log in, clear way to create an account,\nand no unnecessary content to distract the user. The more straightforward the\nweb is, the better.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
