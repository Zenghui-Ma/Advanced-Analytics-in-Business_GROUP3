This means\nprofessionals and creatives will need to tap into increased compute power,\nregardless of the scale, complexity or scope of their projects.\n\nTo meet this growing need, NVIDIA is expanding its RTX professional graphics\nofferings with two new NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs for desktops: the\nNVIDIA RTX A400 and NVIDIA RTX A1000.\n\nThey expand access to AI and ray-tracing technology, equipping professionals\nwith the tools they need to transform their daily workflows.\n\n## A New Era of Creativity, Performance and Efficiency\n\nThe RTX A400 GPU introduces accelerated ray tracing and AI to the RTX 400\nseries GPUs. With 24 Tensor Cores for AI processing, it surpasses traditional\nCPU-based solutions, enabling professionals to run cutting-edge AI\napplications, such as intelligent chatbots and copilots, directly on their\ndesktops.\n\nThe GPU delivers real-time ray tracing so creators can build vivid, physically\naccurate 3D renders that push the boundaries of creativity and realism.\n\nThe A400 also includes four display outputs, a first for its series. This\nmakes it ideal for high-density display environments, which are critical for\nindustries like financial services, command and control, retail, and\ntransportation.\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX A1000 GPU brings Tensor Cores and RT Cores to the RTX 1000\nseries GPUs for the first time, unlocking accelerated AI and ray-tracing\nperformance for creatives and professionals.\n\nWith 72 Tensor Cores, the A1000 offers a tremendous upgrade over the previous\ngeneration, delivering over 3x faster generative AI processing for tools like\nStable Diffusion. In addition, its 18 RT Cores speed graphics and rendering\ntasks by up to 3x, accelerating professional workflows such as 2D and 3D\ncomputer-aided design (CAD), product and architectural design, and 4K video\nediting.\n\nThe A1000 also excels in video processing, handling up to 38% more encode\nstreams and offering 2x faster decode performance over the previous\ngeneration.\n\nWith a sleek, single-slot design and consuming just 50W, the A400 and A1000\nGPUs bring impressive features to compact, energy-efficient workstations.\n\n## Expanding the Reach of RTX\n\nThese new GPUs empower users with cutting-edge AI, graphics and compute\ncapabilities to boost productivity and unlock creative possibilities. Advanced\nworkflows involving ray-traced renders and AI are now within reach, allowing\nprofessionals to push the boundaries of their work and achieve stunning levels\nof realism.\n\nIndustrial planners can use these new powerful and energy-efficient computing\nsolutions for edge deployments. Creators can boost editing and rendering\nspeeds to produce richer visual content. Architects and engineers can\nseamlessly transition ideas from 3D CAD concepts into tangible designs. Teams\nworking in smart spaces can use the GPUs for real-time data processing, AI-\nenhanced security and digital signage management in space-constrained\nsettings. And healthcare professionals can achieve quicker, more precise\nmedical imaging analyses.\n\nFinancial professionals have always used expansive, high-resolution visual\nworkspaces for more effective trading, analysis and data management. With the\nRTX A400 GPU supporting up to four 4K displays natively, financial services\nusers can now achieve a high display density with fewer GPUs, streamlining\ntheir setups and reducing costs.\n\n## Next-Generation Features and Accelerated Performance\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX A400 and A1000 GPUs are equipped with features designed to\nsupercharge everyday workflows, including:\n\n  * Second-generation RT Cores: Real-time ray tracing, photorealistic, physically based rendering and visualization for all professional workflows, including architectural drafting, 3D design and content creation, where accurate lighting and shadow simulations can greatly enhance the quality of work.\n  * Third-generation Tensor Cores: Accelerates AI-augmented tools and applications such as generative AI, image rendering denoising and deep learning super sampling to improve image generation speed and quality.\n  * Ampere architecture-based CUDA cores: Up to 2x the single-precision floating point throughput of the previous generation for significant speedups in graphics and compute workloads.\n  * 4GB or 8GB of GPU memory: 4GB of GPU memory with the A400 GPU and 8GB with the A1000 GPU accommodate a range of professional needs, from basic graphic design and photo editing to more demanding 3D modeling with textures or high-resolution editing and data analyses. The GPUs also feature increased memory bandwidth over the previous generation for quicker data processing and smoother handling of larger datasets and scenes.\n  * Encode and decode engines: With seventh-generation encode (NVENC) and fifth-generation decode (NVDEC) engines, the GPUs offer efficient video processing to support high-resolution video editing, streaming and playback with ultra-low latency. Inclusion of AV1 decode enables higher efficiency and smoother playback of more video formats.\n\n## Availability\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX A1000 GPU is now available through global distribution partners\nsuch as PNY and Ryoyo Electric. The RTX A400 GPU is expected to be available\nfrom channel partners starting in May, with anticipated availability from\nmanufacturers in the summer.\n\nCategories: Pro Graphics\n\nTags: Artificial Intelligence | Generative AI | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering\n\n### All NVIDIA News\n\nTo Cut a Long Story Short: Video Editors Benefit From DaVinci Resolve\u2019s New AI\nFeatures Powered by RTX\n\nThis NVIDIA Scientist and Engineer Techs Medicine to the Next Level\n\nAI Is Tech\u2019s \u2018Greatest Contribution to Social Elevation,\u2019 NVIDIA CEO Tells\nOregon State Students\n\nBethesda\u2019s \u2018Fallout\u2019 Titles Join GeForce NOW\n\nCombating Corruption With Data: Cleanlab and Berkeley Research Group on Using\nAI-Powered Investigative Analytics\n\nExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Manage My Privacy\n  * Legal\n  * Accessibility\n  * Product Security\n  * Contact\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NVIDIA Corporation\n\nUSA - United States\n\nNVIDIA websites use cookies to deliver and improve the website experience.
