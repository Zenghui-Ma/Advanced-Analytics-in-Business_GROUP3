I genuinely feel we've been through a lot with Sentry and\nour learnings provide value to others. More so, I believe people in this\nindustry, most successful people, do others a disservice by not having honest\nconversations about the hardships and endurance it takes to succeed. This all\nstarted with Sentry: From the Beginning .\n\nDon\u2019t worry, we all do. So how can we get better? Let me give you the lens of\nsomeone who\u2019s built a business, someone with strong beliefs around what does\nand doesn\u2019t work, but otherwise has no clue what they\u2019re talking about. This\nis all grounded in what I\u2019ve seen at Sentry over the years, so let me take you\nthrough our go-to-market journey a little bit.\n\nThe biggest question people ask me is how we found product market fit. Often\nwhat they\u2019re asking is how we attracted our first customers. That\u2019s a\nmarketing question. My answer has generally been that I\u2019m not really sure, but\nI do have some ideas on what worked. You see, early days Sentry we weren\u2019t\ntrying to build the business. Instead I was working on things for other\ncompanies, and most of Sentry\u2019s market presence was seen through social\ninteractions, often at conferences. You might say we were an early adopter of\nDevRel tactics, but there was a key difference: there was no fluff.\n\nI wasn\u2019t speaking about some bullshit topic at a conference, or giving a\nterrible demo of a half-assed product. I was building a brand. That brand was\ncentered around trust and authenticity. It was represented when I - just like\nwith this blog - gave my honest point of view on challenges. I would talk\nabout how I approached scaleability issues with duct tape-esque hacks, or how\nwe were building an open source business out of Sentry. I was giving people\ngenuine value alongside interesting content. I was doing it all from real\nworld experience, not manufactured, make believe stories about how things\nwork. That\u2019s marketing.\n\nI did that for many years early in my career. I traveled around to various\nevents, often within the Python community, talking to colleagues and speaking\nabout things I had learned in my career. That meant when we started charging\nfor Sentry, many people already knew who I was, as well as what Sentry was.\nMany were already using the open source project, and more than happy to pay\nthe affordable price tag we had set. That happened because we had achieved\nwhat many fail to understand about marketing: we had created awareness.\n\nYou see, when we buy ads - that is, we as in Sentry - we\u2019re not actually\nbuying conversions. That\u2019s not true for all businesses. When I scroll\nInstagram and buy whaetver junk I run across, I\u2019ve probably never seen the\nbrand before, and its a one-time impulse buy. When you buy Sentry however\nyou\u2019re buying a brand, and what that brand has promised you. In our case, we\nthink of our brand as a number of things, but particularly important are\nproduct quality/excellence and trust/authenticity. Some of you are probably\nrolling your eyes right now, but consider where you spend money in life. Why\ndo you eat up everything Apple has to offer? Why do people spend money on a\nRolex? Why do I have a Red Bull in my hand right now? This $10 can of still\nwater from Liquid Death? You\u2019re buying into something more than a product,\nyou\u2019re buying into a brand.\n\nWhen we acquired Syntax a lot of people were confused. One of our board\nmembers, someone who trusts our decision making, asked with an extremely\nserious face how this made sense for the business. You see, most people while\nthey believe in brand, they still have a hard time actually committing to it.\nSyntax is a brand investment for Sentry. It\u2019s not an advertising channel. It\u2019s\nnot a podcast. Its a brand, both in name as well as via the hosts, that people\ntrust to inform them about a set of technologies. That brand trust, that brand\nloyalty, we invest into that. We invest into that because if you value a\nbrand, you will give them a shot to earn your money. It\u2019s often hard to\nmeasure, but the results are everywhere if you look.\n\nBillboards are no different. Our CFO, rightfully so, is highly skeptical of\nbillboards. What makes them valuable? Just like digital advertising, you cant\nput up a billboard and pretend thats going to instantly convert to leads. Its\njust another touch point. I was at my wife\u2019s holiday party two year ago. It\u2019s\na larger company with executives who are much more seasoned than me, and more\nimportantly, a place where everyone was a stranger. She wanted to introduce me\nto their CTO, who she didn\u2019t know, which meant an awkward bump-into-them-and-\nstart-a-convo. The CTO was clearly expecting it, as is their job at a party\nlike this, but what he wasnt expecting what happened next. I mentioned that I\nstarted a company called Sentry many years ago, and the CTO\u2019s partner\nimmediately interjected: \u201cLike those bilboards?\u201c. Yep, like those billboards.\nShe recognized our billboard because it was interesting. The CTO\u2019s ears\nimmediately perked up, and that got the conversation started.\n\nAside, if you don\u2019t understand what the point of our billboard campaign was,\nyou wouldn\u2019t be alone! We\u2019re not pitching, or even explaining our product.\nWe\u2019re aiming for intrigue. What is Sentry? What can\u2019t Sentry fix? Why is there\na minotaur playing in VR? Even if you know about Sentry, you\u2019d know Sentry\ndoesn\u2019t fix anything, we just tell you what\u2019s wrong!\n\nNow that precise scenario is not high value for Sentry - the CTO isn\u2019t our\ncustomer - but you can imagine a world where he\u2019s reviewing a contract put in\nfront of him by his engineering teams, and that contract says Sentry on it. He\nwill (ideally) recognize the name, and either immediately let his guard down,\nor even better, have a point of contact that he trusts. Brand is all about\nmarket awareness. It\u2019s about making sure people know who you are, what you\nstand for, and eventually what you\u2019re offering them. That means that no matter\nthe touch points, all we\u2019re trying to do is reenforce \u201chey we exist and we do\ncool shit\u201d. If you have a need for what we sell, you\u2019ll evaluate it when the\ntime comes.\n\nSo all of this said, you should invest into your brand. If you\u2019re building a\nreal business, and you actually give a shit about your product (rather than\njust making a buck), brand is the strategic investment that will pay dividends\nfor the rest of time. It\u2019s not going to solve for bad product-market fit, and\nit certainly won\u2019t help if your brand values are not represented in your\nproduct, but if you solve for that, brand can be your marketing strategy too.\n\n## More Reading\n\n### You're Not a CEO\n\nMar 26, 2024\n\n### Enterprise is Dead\n\nMar 7, 2024\n\n### Open Source and a Healthy Dose of Capitalism\n\nFeb 1, 2024\n\n### The BUSL Factor\n\nNov 20, 2023\n\n### A $7 Subscription\n\nNov 6, 2023\n\n\u00a9 2024 David Cramer \u2014 Archive\n\n", "frontpage": false}
