Max Azzarello, 37, was\npronounced dead at a city hospital early Saturday, according to police. The\nact of self-immolation was not directly related to the trial: He wrote in\nparanoid manifesto that he took his own life to bring attention to a set of\nconspiratorial beliefs. Below are live updates on this developing story.\n\nCopied\n\nChas Danner Updated Apr. 19, 2024, 11:59 PM EDT\n\n## Azzarello\u2019s life began to unravel after the death of his mother\n\nAccording to the New York Times, people who know Azzarello say he seemed to\nhave succumbed to paranoid thoughts in recent years, particularly after losing\nhis mother to an illness in 2022:\n\n> A closer look at the path the man had traveled to this moment of self-\n> destruction revealed a recent spiral into volatility, one marked by a\n> worldview that had become increasingly confusing and disjointed \u2014 and\n> appeared to be unattached to any political party. His social media postings\n> and arrest records suggest the immolation stemmed instead from a place of\n> conspiracy theories and paranoia.\n\nRead the rest of their report here.\n\nCopied\n\nChas Danner Updated Apr. 19, 2024, 4:28 PM EDT\n\n## He was interviewed on Thursday\n\nFrom the Times\u2019 report on the self-immolation:\n\n> At the park on Thursday, Mr. Azzarello had held up various signs and at one\n> point shouted toward a group of reporters gathered there: \u201cBiggest scoop of\n> your life or your money back!\u201d One of his signs claimed that Mr. Trump and\n> President Biden were \u201cabout to fascist coup us.\u201d\n>\n> In an interview that day, he said his critical views of the American\n> government were shaped by his research into Peter Thiel, the technology\n> billionaire and political provocateur who is a major campaign donor, and\n> into cryptocurrency.\n>\n> Mr. Azzarello said he had planned to protest at Washington Square Park near\n> New York University but thought that with the cold weather, more people\n> would be outside the courthouse.\n>\n> \u201cTrump\u2019s in on it,\u201d Mr. Azzarello said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret\n> kleptocracy, and it can only lead to an apocalyptic fascist coup.\u201d ...\n>\n> Some of the pamphlets [Azzarello threw in the air before setting himself\n> ablaze on Friday] referred to New York University as a \u201cmob front\u201d and also\n> mentioned former President George W.

NYPD chief of department Jeffrey Maddrey said 37-year-old Max\nAzzarello entered a small park at 100 Centre Street surrounded by police\nbarricades at 1:30 p.m. He was then observed rustling through a backpack,\ngrabbing several pamphlets, and scattering them throughout the park. Then he\nreached for a canister containing some form of alcohol-based accelerant,\npoured it over himself, and lit himself on fire. \u201cCivilians, court officers,\nmembers of the police department, they run into the park. They make efforts to\nput him out. They used their coats, they used fire extinguishers,\u201d Maddrey\nsaid.\n\nAzzarello was rushed to Cornell Burn Center, where he remains in critical\ncondition. Authorities said he is considered likely to survive.\n\nDespite its close proximity to the courthouse, the park has remained open to\nthe public. \u201cThis gentleman did not breach security protocols. The park was\nopen to the public.\u201d Maddrey said. \u201cBut, of course we\u2019re going to look at\neverything and, with the magnitude of what\u2019s going on right here, we\u2019ll\nreassess our security with our federal partners.\u201d\n\nCopied\n\nJustin Miller Updated Apr. 19, 2024, 3:59 PM EDT\n\n## A witness cried for help, then flames\n\nAn eyewitness captured most of the incident in a video, embedded below, which\nis extremely graphic. The eyewitness, who asked to remain anonymous, screamed\nout for police as they watched the man pour accelerant on himself. The man\nthen pulled a lighter from his right pocket and ignited the accelerant,\nsending a tower of flame toward the sky before he staggered forward several\nsteps and fell to the ground. Police and court officers rushed into the park,\nworking desperately to extinguish the flames.\n\nCopied\n\nChas Danner Updated Apr. 19, 2024, 3:42 PM EDT\n\n## The Trump trial resumed as normal\n\nPer the New York Times:\n\n> Al Baker, a spokesman for the court system, says the trial schedule would\n> not be affected by the man setting himself on fire.
