This is not the first time however that former Apple employees\nhave released products that were not well received. The engineering behind the\nAI Pin is impressive but integrating the product into everyday life has been\nunder scrutiny.\n\nThe AI pin is in its early stages, but what does history tell us about the\nfuture of the device?\n\n###\n\nWhat is Humane\u2019s AI Pin?\n\nThe AI pin is a screenless hardware device that clips onto a user's clothing,\nusing a magnetic battery pack, and acts as a wearable companion.\n\nCredit: Amelia Holowaty Krales, The Verge\n\nIt is multi-modal, featuring a camera, microphone, touch-pad and has a laser\nprojector that displays information onto the user's outstretched hand.\n\nThe device operates entirely independently of a smartphone, and uses AI via\nthe cloud to answer questions you throw at it using speech and showing it\nanything in front of you with its camera. It can also record images and videos\nfor later use which can be accessed through a web portal - not a mobile app.\n\nThe device can detect the depth of field of your hand, and impressively, this\nis exactly how you can interact with the projected \u201cscreen\u201d. Unlocking your AI\npin with your hand involves tilting your hand in the direction of numbers in\nyour pin code for example. An example of the screen is shown below (credit for\nphoto to Allison Johnson, The Verge).\n\nIt is important to note that not having an accompanying app, as well as having\nits own SIM card, imply strongly that Humane intentionally plans for the AI\npin to be a successor or replacement to the smartphone.\n\n###\n\nHow Has it Been Received?\n\nAnyone reading this who has followed the AI pin\u2019s announcement and release,\nhas no-doubt heard the scathing reviews it\u2019s received.\n\nArguably the most well-known tech-reviewer, Marques Brownlee (with 18.7\nmillion YouTube subscribers at the time of writing this) made a comprehensive\nreview of the device, hilarious titled \u201cThe Worst Product I\u2019ve Ever\nReviewed...For Now\u201d.\n\nThe video, its thumbnail and title came under a lot of fire, for potentially\ndamaging the company\u2019s chance at success - in response Marquees released a\nvideo defending his position as a reviewer.\n\nThe review however is a good comprehensive analysis and review, and I\nrecommend watching it for a solid overview of the product.\n\nCriticisms from reviewers generally have included:\n\n  * The steep $699 starting price, and subsequent subscription fee\n\n  * The magnetic wireless battery pack although impressive, causes heat around the region it attaches to the users clothing\n\n  * The time taken for the device to answer a question is too long\n\n  * The device has its own SIM card, so sending texts and receiving calls cannot be done on your own number\n\n  * As it does not connect to your smartphone, so any application you\u2019re used to using, like Uber or literally anything else cannot be accessed using the device\n\n###\n\nWho Are the Founders?\n\nThe founders are husband and wife team Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno,\nwho both met while working at Apple on the iPad.\n\nCredit: humane.com/story\n\nBethany Bongiorno was a Director of Software Engineering at Apple, and led\nsoftware project management for macOS and iOS. Bongiorno played a key part in\nthe launch of the original iPad and prior to joining Apple had a background in\nastrophysics as well as working as a data management and software development\nconsultant.\n\nImran Chaudri joined Apple in 1995 originally as an intern, subsequently\nhaving a 19-year career as a designer at the company. He designed features for\nmost Apple products during his time there, as well as being credited as an\ninventor on Apple patents such as a touch screen.\n\nAt first glance, it is clear a lot of Apple\u2019s DNA is present in the AI Pin\u2019s\nlook and feel.\n\n###\n\nGeneral Magic - Has this Happened Before?\n\nIn 1992, a company that could be considered an Apple spin-off, founded by Bill\nAtkinson, Andy Hertzfeld and Marc Porat began operating in stealth after their\nproject had not progressed when operating within Apple.\n\nTheir aim was to develop the future of technology, a lot of which we can see\nforms of day-to-day today in the smartphone.\n\nTheir main product was Magic Cap, an operating system that allowed people to\ncarry out wireless communication in ways that would empower the user. This\noperating system would run on personal digital assistants (PDAs) for\nprofessional use, and have a UI framework allowing people to access different\nfeatures in different \u201crooms\u201d.\n\nThe Magic Cap was implemented on Sony and Motorola hardware, released in 1994\nand 1995 respectively, however the launch under performed, due to a lack of\nsupporting technology infrastructure.\n\nThe MagicLink PDA by Sony, running the Magic Cap OS.

Image by Rama & Mus\u00e9e Bolo\n\nDespite having a huge buzz and backed by huge names including Sony, Motorola,\nMatsushita, Philips and AT&T Corporation, General Magic ultimately failed due\nto what the market truly wanted at the time, and what technology\ninfrastructure around it allowed it to achieve.\n\nGeneral Magic\u2019s engineering was ahead of its time - responsible for\nbreakthroughs considered precursors to USB,integrated systems-on-a-chip (SoC)\ndesigns for partner devices, cloud technology and touchscreen computing.\n\nGeneral magic is an essential case study for incredible engineering, at\npotentially the wrong time for success. Many of their team went on to be trail\nblazers in their field including:\n\nKevin Lynch, worked as the CTO of Adobe, developed the Apple Watch, currently\nVP of Technology at Apple\n\nMegan Smith, General manager of Google.org, VP at Google X, CTO of USA\nAssistant to President Barack Obama\n\nTony Fadell, Creator of the iPod, co-create the iPhone and founded Nest. He\nalso wrote Build, which is a book I recommend reading for anyone in startups,\nhardware development, or product design. I reviewed it my article \u201cThe Best\nStartup Books You've Never Heard Of\".\n\nThe two companies have impressive technology in common, however General Magic\nclearly pioneered technology in ways that were not seen previously.\n\nVoice, cloud computing, AI, wireless charging are all technologies we see\ncurrently. The innovation AI Pin has is aimed less in developing new\ntechnology, and more in creating new user experiences by combining\ntechnologies that are available for companies to use today.\n\nIt should be noted however, that the company began in 2018 in stealth and in a\nworld prior to ChatGPT\u2019s success, a device like the AI Pin\u2019s could certainly\nhave been considered innovative.\n\nThis is worth remembering as in March 2023, it was announced that Microsoft\nand OpenAI had formed a partnership with Humane - which could have accelerated\ndevelopment or the mass adoption of AI and large-language models could have\nput pressure on a release before features were ready.\n\nOverall, General Magic and Humane have in common a device with impressive\nengineering features, but released at a time when people may not have been\nready. Where they differ however is that General Magic created technology that\ncan be considered precursors to what we have now, and have a strong alumni\nthat have shaped the world of tech in several different avenues. Humane, could\nwell have intended to pioneer AI, however what they have achieved so far is to\nchallenge how we can use AI and language in a world without smartphones.\n\n###\n\nDoes Humane Deserve Credit?\n\nAlthough the product itself has fallen short of being usable day-to-day, it is\none of the few challengers to mobile technology.\n\nImage by Allison Johnson, The Verge\n\nFor years, smartphone technology, and hardware products in general have not\nchanged significantly in design or user experience, and Humane have made a\nstrong effort to do so.\n\nRabbit is a company looking to make similar challenges to the AI Pin but in a\ndifferent way. Rabbit\u2019s R1 - announced in January this year at CES 2024 is a\nretro themed device that users speak into, has a camera and uses a Large\nAction Model (LAM) to carry out tasks.\n\nThe Rabbit R1. Image by John Kim, CNET\n\nIn collaboration with design firm Teenage Engineering, Its biggest difference\nis that it interacts with users\u2019 mobile apps directly - which is enough to\nmake it seem a superior AI companion to the AI Pin as it can leverage the app\necosystem it already has, rather than try to establish itself as a standalone\ndevice.\n\nThe device runs the Linux-based - RabbitOS and leverages large-action-model\n(LAM) technology to carry out tasks we already do on our smartphones and has a\nretro design, courtesy of their designers Teenage Engineering.\n\nChallenging smartphones is something that\u2019s needed, as using a phone now, can\nbe as much about content consumption as it is about utility. Social media is\ndesigned to form addictive habits for people, and the days of using a phone\nsimply to contact people seem like a long time ago.\n\nPhone addiction is something that affects a lot of people, and there\u2019s a\nbrilliant community of people on the subreddit r/dumbphones that use single-\npurpose hardware products, including a non-smartphone. Although I do not do\nthis myself, reading the subreddit was really refreshing. Whether it was\nHumane\u2019s noble mission or not, prioritising utility and limiting consumption\nin mobile technology, is something they should receive credit for.\n\nBoth Rabbit\u2019s R1 and Humane\u2019s AI Pin feel like refreshing challenges to an\notherwise saturated market. Although Humane looks to have fallen short of\nconvincing the tech community of their viability, they deserve respect for\nmaking a challenge in space.\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for AI Hardware?\n\nHumane created a road map for their products, and although the reception of\ntheir first product may have hindered their expectations, it will be\ninteresting to keep an eye on.\n\nPrevious startups built by Apple alumni have not always grasped what users are\nready for, or delivered products that are technically ready.\n\nHumane and Rabbit are companies looking to be leveraging AI for new\ninteractions with hardware - even earlier this week, Limitless AI announced\ntheir voice recording wearable device. This is clearly leading to a new wave\nof hardware originality, which is exciting to see.\n\nLimitless AI\u2019s wearable pendent, image from Limitless AI.\n\nSmartwatches take a similar form factor to the AI Pin and R1, so it will be\ninteresting to see if they have a more prominent role in the technology\necosystem. For good or bad, this could be how big tech companies respond, as\nsmartwatches from them already exist - implementing AI voice technology into\nsmall form factor devices could be how they move forward, if people take to\nvoice controlled devices.\n\nThanks for reading - let me know your thoughts and subscribe if you found this\ninteresting!\n\n###\n\nReferences and Additional Reading\n\nLooking up all of the stories and background to the info was a lot of fun -\nhere are the resources I found interesting for anyone who wants to dig deeper\ninto any area.\n\n  * A breakdown of how RabbitOS uses Large Action Model\n\n  * A good breakdown of Rabbit R1 by Klu.ai\n\n  * Founder profiles of Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudri\n\n  * Marquess Brownlee\u2019s YouTube channel\n\n  * Great info on General Magic by Josh Carter\n\n  * General Magic documentary film IMDB page\n\n  * Wall Street Journal Article Announcing Humane\u2019s partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft\n\n  * A nice breakdown from a hardware engineering perspective of the AI pin, by Duane Benson from All About Circuits\n\n  * Limitless AI pendent\n\n### Subscribe to Greg\u2019s Substack\n\nLaunched 2 months ago\n\nWriting what I learn about as an engineer in my field\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Humane's AI Pin - Today's General Magic?\n\ngregtidanian.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThe Best Startup Books You've Never Heard Of\n\nThe hidden gems that provide great advice as well as anecdotes that backup\ntheir guidance.\n\nApr 1 \u2022\n\nGreg\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Best Startup Books You've Never Heard Of\n\ngregtidanian.substack.com\n\nMy CES 2024 Experience\n\nI was fortunate enough to attend CES 2024 in Las Vegas with the startup I work\nat, Valkyrie Industries.
