These\nautoantibodies appear to bind to both human cells and common pathogens,\npossibly explaining the immune attacks on the brain and spinal cord that are\nthe hallmark of MS.\n\nThe findings were published in Nature Medicine on April 19.\n\nMS can lead to a devastating loss of motor control, although new treatments\ncan slow the progress of the disease and, for example, preserve a patient\u2019s\nability to walk. The scientists hope the autoantibodies they have discovered\nwill one day be detected with a simple blood test, giving patients a head\nstart on receiving treatment.\n\n\u201cOver the last few decades, there's been a move in the field to treat MS\nearlier and more aggressively with newer, more potent therapies,\u201d said UCSF\nneurologist Michael Wilson, MD, a senior author of the paper. \u201cA diagnostic\nresult like this makes such early intervention more likely, giving patients\nhope for a better life.\u201d\n\nLinking infections with autoimmune disease\n\nAutoimmune diseases like MS are believed to result, in part, from rare immune\nreactions to common infections.\n\nIn 2014, Wilson joined forces with Joe DeRisi, PhD, president of the Chan\nZuckerberg Biohub SF and a senior author of the paper, to develop better tools\nfor unmasking the culprits behind autoimmune disease. They took a technique in\nwhich viruses are engineered to display bits of proteins like flags on their\nsurface, called phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq), and\nfurther optimized it to screen human blood for autoantibodies.\n\nPhIP-Seq detects autoantibodies against more than 10,000 human proteins,\nenough to investigate nearly any autoimmune disease. In 2019, they\nsuccessfully used it to discover a rare autoimmune disease that seemed to\narise from testicular cancer.\n\nMS affects more than 900,000 people in the US. Its early symptoms, like\ndizziness, spasms, and fatigue, can resemble other conditions, and diagnosis\nrequires careful analysis of brain MRI scans.\n\nThe phage display system, the scientists reasoned, could reveal the\nautoantibodies behind the immune attacks of MS and create new opportunities to\nunderstand and treat the disease.\n\nThe project was spearheaded by first co-authors Colin Zamecnik, PhD, a\npostdoctoral researcher in DeRisi\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s labs; and Gavin Sowa, MD, MS,\nformer UCSF medical student and now internal medicine resident at Northwestern\nUniversity.\n\nThey partnered with Mitch Wallin, MD, MPH, from the University of Maryland and\na senior author of the paper, to search for autoantibodies in the blood of\npeople with MS. These samples were obtained from the U.S. Department of\nDefense Serum Repository, which stores blood taken from armed service members\nwhen they apply to join the military.\n\nThe group analyzed blood from 250 MS patients collected after their diagnosis,\nplus samples taken five or more years earlier when they joined the military.\nThe researchers also looked at comparable blood samples from 250 healthy\nveterans.\n\nBetween the large number of subjects and the before-and-after timing of the\nsamples, it was \u201ca phenomenal cohort of individuals to look at to see how this\nkind of autoimmunity develops over the course of clinical onset of this\ndisease,\u201d said Zamecnik.\n\nA consistent signature of MS\n\nUsing a mere one-thousandth of a milliliter of blood from each time point, the\nscientists thought they would see a jump in autoantibodies as the first\nsymptoms of MS appeared.\n\nInstead, they found that 10% of the MS patients had a striking abundance of\nautoantibodies years before their diagnosis.\n\nThe dozen or so autoantibodies all stuck to a chemical pattern that resembled\none found in common viruses, including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), which infects\nmore than 85% of all people, yet has been flagged in previous studies as a\ncontributing cause for MS.\n\nYears before diagnosis, this subset of MS patients had other signs of an\nimmune war in the brain. Ahmed Abdelhak, MD, co-author of the paper and a\npostdoctoral researcher in the UCSF laboratory of Ari Green, MD, found that\npatients with these autoantibodies had elevated levels of neurofilament light\n(Nfl), a protein that gets released as neurons break down.\n\nPerhaps, the researchers speculated, the immune system was mistaking friendly\nhuman proteins for some viral foe, leading to a lifetime of MS.\n\n\u201cWhen we analyze healthy people using our technology, everybody looks unique,\nwith their own fingerprint of immunological experience, like a snowflake,\u201d\nDeRisi said. \u201cIt\u2019s when the immunological signature of a person looks like\nsomeone else, and they stop looking like snowflakes that we begin to suspect\nsomething is wrong, and that\u2019s what we found in these MS patients.\u201d\n\nA test to speed patients toward the right therapies\n\nTo confirm their findings, the team analyzed blood samples from patients in\nthe UCSF ORIGINS study. These patients all had neurological symptoms and many,\nbut not all, went on to be diagnosed with MS.\n\nOnce again, 10% of the patients in the ORIGINS study who were diagnosed with\nMS had the same autoantibody pattern. The pattern was 100% predictive of an MS\ndiagnosis. Across both the Department of Defense group and the ORIGINS group,\nevery patient with this autoantibody pattern had MS.\n\n\u201cDiagnosis is not always straightforward for MS, because we haven\u2019t had\ndisease specific biomarkers,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have anything\nthat can give more diagnostic certainty earlier on, to have a concrete\ndiscussion about whether to start treatment for each patient.\u201d\n\nMany questions remain about MS, ranging from what\u2019s instigating the immune\nresponse in some MS patients to how the disease develops in the other 90% of\npatients. But the researchers believe they now have a definitive sign that MS\nis brewing.\n\n\u201cImagine if we could diagnose MS before some patients reach the clinic,\u201d said\nStephen Hauser, MD, director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and\na senior author of the paper. \u201cIt enhances our chances of moving from\nsuppression to cure.\u201d\n\nFor funding and disclosures, see the paper.\n\nOther UCSF authors are Ravi Dandekar, Rebecca D.
