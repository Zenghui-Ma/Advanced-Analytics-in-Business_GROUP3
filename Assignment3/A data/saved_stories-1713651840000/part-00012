See how records are made in 2024.\n\nStory by Rachel Lerman\n\nPhotography and videos by Kate Dearman\n\nApril 20, 2024 at 8:05 a.m.\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nA 12-inch vinyl record can hold about 44 minutes of music. But manufacturing\none can take multiple days \u2014 a complex but delicate process involving\nsapphires, rubies and silver.\n\nMusic fans may love the immediacy of streaming music, but that hasn\u2019t stopped\nthem from bringing vinyl records mainstream. Revenue from vinyl jumped 10\npercent to $1.4 billion in 2023, and outsold CDs for the second time since\n1987, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nArtists like Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kacey Musgraves are leaning in,\nreleasing vinyl albums with new colors, cover art and, sometimes, exclusive\ntracks.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, The Washington Post visited Nashville\u2019s United Record Pressing,\nwhich made the first Beatles single in the United States in 1963, to witness\nthe 2024 vinyl-making process and watch a Tyler, the Creator record get\npressed.\n\nFollow along and find out how records are made \u2014 from lacquer to label.\n\n### Making the \u2018DNA\u2019\n\nFirst, the artist records their album. Then a relay race begins. A sound\nengineer masters the digital files, sending a high-quality version of the\ntracks to the cutting engineer.\n\nA lacquer, a soft material similar to nail polish, is attached to an aluminum\nplate.\n\nAt United Record Pressing\u2019s facility, a stylus with a sapphire or ruby point\nvibrates with the sound of the music, and cuts the sound waves onto the\nlacquer, creating the grooves that allow you to hear music.\n\n\u201cThe cut is almost like DNA,\u201d said Matt Lindsey, United Record Pressing\u2019s\nchief technology officer. \u201cIt\u2019s specific and unique to that music content\nonly.\u201d\n\nA plating technician then drills the lacquer to create a hole in the middle,\nand scores the edges so an electrical current can carry through the material.\n\n### Silver \u2018spray paint\u2019\n\nLong before the vinyl record is made, the lacquer has to be carefully cleaned\nand rinsed before it is \u201csilvered\u201d \u2014 sprayed with a liquid silver solution.\nThe liquid silver makes the lacquer disc electrically conductive, so it can be\ncopied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a spray paint booth,\u201d Lindsey said. The tool used for silvering is\nbasically the same thing as a spray paint head, he said.\n\nThe disc is mounted to be put into a nickel plating bath where it will be\ncopied.\n\nThis disc is still not a record we buy \u2014 but it\u2019s getting closer.\n\n### Peeling off the copies\n\nNext come large chemical baths with electricity running through them, where\nthe silvered lacquer disc is submerged.\n\n\u201cIts like a cooking a really slow temperature meat,\u201d said Dustin Blocker,\nchief creative officer of vinyl manufacturing company Hand Drawn Records, in\nDallas. Dissolved pellets of nickel in the bath are attracted to the silvered\ndisc and conform to the shape and grooves of the lacquer.\n\nAbout 12 hours later, the nickel creates a mirror image copy of the lacquer\ndisc. \u201cThe longer you can roast it, the better that copy is going to be,\u201d said\nBlocker, who is also president of the Vinyl Records Manufacturing Association.\n\nThat mirror image copy is peeled from the lacquer disc \u2014 and copied again.\n\nThis critical process eventually creates metal copies called \u201cstampers,\u201d used\non the pressing machine to create an actual vinyl record that can be sold.\n\n\u201cWe try to make that stamper as closely resembling the grooves of that lacquer\nas possible,\u201d Lindsey said.\n\nBut first, the stampers must be prepared so they will fit in the pressing\nmachine.\n\nTheir centers are punched out, and edges are formed using a machine.\n\nA final stamper looks like a metal-plate, mirror-image version of a vinyl\nrecord. Its ridges will create the record\u2019s grooves, which ultimately allow\nmusic to play.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### A \u2018giant waffle maker\u2019 for records\n\nAt last, it\u2019s finally time to press the record \u2014 the complex process is\nnearing an end.\n\nThe actual material you feel on a vinyl record is PVC, or polyvinyl chloride,\nwhich often comes in the form of small pellets.\n\nThe PVC is fed into a part of the record pressing machine where it is melted\nat 250 degrees into a hockey-puck-like shape.\n\nThe puck, with a consistency like taffy, gets sent to the hydraulic press.\nThere, the machine squishes the two stampers \u2014 for the A side and B side of a\nrecord \u2014 applying heat with high pressure steam and forcing the puck to\nconform to their shape.\n\nThink of it as a \u201cgiant waffle maker,\u201d said Jenn D\u2019Eugenio, president and\nfounder of Austin-based Women in Vinyl. This part only takes about 20 to 30\nseconds, she said.\n\nA quick 10-second water cooling in the press forces the record to hold its\nshape.\n\nThe imprinted vinyl record is next trimmed, cooled and packaged for music\nlovers.\n\nUnited Record Pressing has different machines to make various sizes of\nrecords, including a 7-inch machine, shown pressing an Elvis record, and a\n12-inch machine, shown pressing a 2017 Tyler, the Creator record, \u201cFlower\nBoy.\u201d Colored PVC is used to make records in vibrant colors, a trend that has\ngotten more popular as artists experiment with different versions of their\nalbums.\n\nThe cost of making one record varies in the industry depending on the size of\nthe manufacturer and the packaging, but could be between $6 and $9, Blocker\nsaid.\n\nAs demand surges, some record pressing plants, like United Record Pressing,\nhave significantly expanded their operations. The company, which is marking\nits 75th anniversary this year, expanded its plant starting in 2016, moving\nfrom a 25,000-square-foot plant to a 155,000-square-foot facility. It now has\n66 pressing machines, triple the number of presses than when CEO Mark Michaels\nbought the company in 2007, and has the capacity to press up to 80,000 records\nper day.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeventeen years ago, Michaels thought he was buying a business that would stay\nfairly niche.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would die, but I didn\u2019t think it would go crazy with\ngrowth,\u201d he said. \u201cIts gone from kind of a forgotten industry to something\nthat drew more intention, more investment and has become increasingly\nsophisticated.\u201d\n\n##### About this story\n\nDesign and development by Courtney Beesch and Tyler Remmel.
