Its ability to efficiently calculate\npolynomial multiplication using the convolution theorem with a quasi-linear\ncomplexity instead of when implemented with Fast Fourier Transform-style\nalgorithms has made it a key component in modern cryptography. FFT-style NTT\nalgorithm or fast-NTT is particularly useful in lattice-based cryptography. In\nthis short note, we briefly introduce the basic concepts of linear, cyclic,\nand negacyclic convolutions via traditional schoolbook algorithms, traditional\nNTT, its inverse (INTT), and FFT-like versions of NTT/INTT. We then provide\nconsistent toy examples through different concepts and algorithms to\nunderstand the basics of NTT concepts.\n\nNote: This is a partial re-publication of the concepts part of the paper:\n\"Conceptual Review on Number Theoretic Transform and Comprehensive Review on\nIts Implementations\", DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3294446 The original paper\nconsists of the NTT concepts and a comparison between its hardware\nimplementation, while this paper only contains the concept part.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nCategory\n\n    Foundations\nPublication info\n\n    Published elsewhere.
