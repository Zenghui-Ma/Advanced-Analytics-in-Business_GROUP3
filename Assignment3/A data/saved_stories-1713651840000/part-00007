While she said there are some guardrails in place, Makanju\nwarned of the \u201cliar\u2019s dividends\u201d where the public becomes so distrustful of\nall content that they no longer know what to believe as the truth.\n\n\u201cWe need to strike a balance between generating awareness that [deepfakes]\nexist and overstating the case of nothing is real anymore, and people can\u2019t\ntrust their eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
