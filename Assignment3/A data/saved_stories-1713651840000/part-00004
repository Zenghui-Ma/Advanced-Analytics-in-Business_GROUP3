Recent research has shown that the work from home (WFH) and\nhybrid work models have had large positive impacts on the economy. WFH will,\nin my opinion, have a greater influence on economic development in the next\nfew decades than AI.\n\n####\n\nWork from Home Research\n\nDuring the pandemic, many firms changed their work model from a primarily\noffice-centric model to WFH. Both firms and workers discovered that WFH is a\nfeasible working method, and to this day, there is still a significant number\nof people working either fully remote or in hybrid work set-ups. As can be\nseen in the following chart, it appears this new form of work organization is\nhere to say.\n\nThe addition of WFH as a form of work organization has naturally led to many\nquestions about whether it is beneficial. We will focus on 4 key issues that\nhave been present in the WFH discussions:\n\n  * WFH and productivity;\n\n  * WFH and innovation;\n\n  * WFH and labor opportunities; and\n\n  * WFH and its impact on geography.\n\n####\n\nProductivity\n\nThere have been a lot of concerns around worker productivity regarding WFH.\nWhen referring to productivity, we are interested in the question of whether\nWFH workers generate more or less \u2018output\u2019 per hour. There has been an influx\nof new research papers on this question and we have touched upon it in our\ndiscussion of the misinterpretation of the research by the Economist.\n\nMany articles and commenters point to headlines that show that worker\nproductivity is lower when working from home. However, the research on this\ntopic often focuses on very specific, repetitive tasks such as \u2018number of\ncalls per hour\u2019, \u2018number of typed words\u2019 or \u2018number of lines of code\u2019. In most\ncases, even if research finds that workers are \u2018less productive\u2019, the total\noutput (i.e. number of calls made) in a day is the same as when people worked\nin an office setting.\n\nTo investigate WFH productivity, Gibbs, Mengel and Siemroth (2021) studied\n10,000 employees in an IT company. Gibbs et al. were able to collect data on\nexactly what tools and software the employees were using on their computers,\nand thus were able to track when these employees were working. Gibbs et al.\nfound that WFH workers generally met all their targeted deadlines, but spent\nmore hours working. This suggests that \u2018productivity\u2019 when working from home\nis lower.\n\nInterestingly, lower productivity depended on the type of worker. Workers that\nhad children saw lower productivity than workers without children. Women also\nsaw larger productivity drops. However, workers that had been at the company\nfor a longer time were actually more productive in a WFH setting.\n\nIn contrast to Gibbs et al., research by Bloom, Liang, Roberts and Ying (2013)\nshowed that call center workers that went remote did 13% more work, of which 9\npercentage points was due to working more minutes per shift, as people were\nsick less often and took shorter breaks.\n\nAnother study by Emanuel and Harrington (2023) looked at the performance of\ncall center workers at one of the largest companies in the US. At this firm,\nprior to the Covid pandemic, some call center workers worked from an office\nwhile others worked from home. Using call log data and workers\u2019 schedules,\nEmanuel and Harrington were able to track how many calls per hour workers were\nresponding to, while controlling for factors such as spending time on work\ntraining or other company tasks.\n\nDuring the Covid pandemic, all workers were forced to work from home. The\nworkers that used to work in the office, were now also working from home.\nCompared to their office level, the number of calls they took per hour dropped\nby 4%. However, one of the reasons for this fall in productivity was\nattributed to an operational reason \u2013 it was tougher for workers to connect to\ntheir managers or receive assistance from others in dealing with challenging\ncalls, resulting in more time spent per call. Nonetheless, overall customer\nsatisfaction did not change when workers moved to remote work.\n\nSeparately, Dutcher and Saral (2022) studied how team productivity may be\nimpacted by work from home and found unexpected results. Using an experimental\nset up, participants were randomly assigned to either work from a location of\ntheir choice or in the laboratory. In the first round of the experiment, each\nparticipant performed a series of transcription tasks for five minutes, for\nwhich they got paid a per completed task rate (piece rate pay). In the next\ntwo rounds, each participant was assigned to a team of three workers. Prior to\nthe beginning of each of the rounds, the participants were told that they\nwould be working with two remote workers in one round and two \u2018office\u2019 (i.e.\nin the laboratory) workers in the other round.\n\nEach participant would also choose how many of their tasks to contribute to\ntheir \u2018own account\u2019 or to a \u2018team account\u2019. For the tasks in their \u2018own\naccount\u2019, they would be paid the same piece rate as before. For the tasks in\nthe \u2018team account\u2019, the pay per task was higher. The caveat, however, was that\nin the team account the pay would be based on the participant that contributed\nthe least amount of tasks. Thus, if you do 10 tasks, and contribute all 10 to\nthe team account, while one of your team members who also does 10 tasks, but\ncontributes 5 tasks, you would receive pay only for the 5 tasks. Thus, how\nmany tasks you contribute to the \u2018team account\u2019 depends on how many tasks your\nfellow team members will complete and contribute to the team account.\n\nDutcher and Saral found that \u2018office\u2019 workers believed that the remote workers\nwould contribute fewer tasks, and, therefore, the \u2018office\u2019 workers chose to\ncontribute less of their tasks to the team account. The overall team\nperformance was dragged down not because remote workers were not contributing\ntheir effort (their tasks), but by \u2018office\u2019 workers that put in less \u2018team\u2019\neffort, because they thought remote workers would be \u2018lazier\u2019. This suggests\nthat team productivity can be influenced by presumptions of the work effort of\nremote workers.\n\nFrom the academic research on this topic of productivity and WFH, we can so\nfar conclude a few things:\n\n  1. Overall output per worker has stayed the same when working from home or from an office.\n\n  2. Productivity may or may not decrease. However, whether productivity is a relevant measure can be questioned as workers still produce the same output.\n\n  3. Productivity may also be influenced by the perceptions between remote and office-based workers.\n\n  4. Better knowledge of the firm processes and access to colleagues appears to matter in making WFH more productive.\n\nIt is important to reiterate that the option of working from home on a large\nscale has only been available for several years, while the office-based model\nhas been around for many decades. Thus, without any significant adaptation of\nwork places to this new reality, it appears that the WFH option has no adverse\neffects on output. Once we improve the WFH model, it is not inconceivable that\nproductivity could unambiguously become higher than in offices.\n\n####\n\nInnovation\n\nFrey and Presidente (2023) analyzed how remote work impacts the development of\ndisruptive discoveries. Looking at research teams that used to work from the\nsame location, but were split into working away from each other, Frey and\nPresidente found that, on average, the probability of the team producing\ndisruptive research1 fell by 10%.2 However, when Frey and Presidente looked at\nthe data only after 2010, it turns out there was no difference in the\nprobability of creating disruptive research whether working in person or\nremotely. There actually may have even been an increase in innovation when\nworking remotely. The intuition as to why remote work became just as effective\nas colocation after 2010 is quite simple: we have developed many technologies\nsuch as Zoom, Teams, Dropbox that significantly improved remote work\nproductivity.3\n\n####\n\nLabor Impacts\n\nRemote work has dramatically changed the job landscape for two groups: people\nwith disabilities and people that take care of dependents, especially mothers.\nAs established in a report by the Economic Innovation Group, people with\ndisabilities were significantly more likely (by 3.5 percentage points) to find\nemployment in 2022 (after the Covid pandemic) than in 2019 (before the\npandemic). At the same time, people without disabilities, at the time of the\nreport, had a lower likelihood of being employed in 2022 than in 2019.4\n\nRegarding mothers, Harrington and Kahn (2023) studied the employment outcomes\nof WFH on working mothers. In industries where a large share of workers were\nWFH, the gap in employment between working mothers and working women without\nchildren reduced.5 Moreover, the incomes of mothers increased by 1.3\npercentage points relative to other women in the workforce.\n\nHarrington and Kahn hypothesize the reason that we may be observing this\npattern is due to the change in the behavior of firms towards mothers\nrequesting WFH. Prior to the pandemic, WFH may have sent a signal to the firm\nthat the mother will commit less effort to the firm, and thus firms chose to\ninvest less in mothers\u2019 skill development (such as training or giving them few\nopportunities). In jobs where this investment is crucial to performance, such\nas finance and marketing industries, mothers had to basically choose to either\ncommit to going to the office or exiting their job. With the recent increase\nin WFH due to the pandemic, it turns out firms were wrong in believing working\nmothers would not put in the effort. Thus, firms started employing mothers\nthat prefer a WFH setup.\n\nThe labor developments of the option of WFH appear to have two major\ncontributions to the wider economy:\n\n  1. It increases the available opportunities to individuals that were previously unfairly disadvantaged in the labor force. This also increases total available labor and increases labor\u2019s diversity which is unambiguously a good thing for the economy (and the individuals involved).\n\n  2. The option for mothers (and fathers) to WFH, without completely sacrificing their careers, allows them to commit more time to their children. Research has shown that parental time is an important input in the development of children (Del Boca, Flinn and Wiswall, 2013; Del Bono, Fracesconi, Kelly and Sacker, 2016). Moreover, since mothers are now able to earn more, this is another source of additional monetary investment in their children.\n\n####\n\nAltering Geography\n\nWFH has also started to transform our urban organization. As we extensively\nsuggested in our previous article on determinants of house prices, WFH may\nimprove urban affordability. Brueckner, Kahn and Lin (2023) have shown both\ntheoretically and empirically that high productivity cities (high income) saw\nprice and rent drops due to WFH, while low productivity cities saw price\nincreases, as people could move to these \u2018cheaper\u2019 cities without foregoing\ntheir higher income of the more \u2018expensive\u2019 city. Moreover, prices within\ncities flattened \u2013 there was less price dispersion based on the distance from\nthe city center (which is where jobs are typically located) due to WFH, with\nsuburbs becoming more expensive and city cores becoming cheaper.\n\nGill, Hensvik and Skans (2023) looked at the impact of WFH on restaurants in\nresidential areas and found that after Covid pandemic, their sales grew\nrelatively more than that of restaurants in the city core. Moreover,\nrestaurant workers in residential areas saw their pay grow by $117 per month\nmore than the income of restaurant workers in the commercial-office areas.\nThis was driven by the fact that they worked longer hours actually, implying\nthere is more business for these residential restaurants.\n\nThe results of these two studies are not surprising. De-linking jobs from land\nwill have profound impacts on how we decide where to live. Cities will change\nbecause of WFH, as we already see many offices closing or standing vacant.\nOffice vacancy rates in the US are at 20%, which was last seen in 1979. This\nwill increase residential housing supply in the long run, as land that was\npreviously used for offices can now be converted into housing. Moreover,\npeople may now be able to optimally choose whether they prefer a city or a\ndifferent lifestyle without having to consider the local job market. This may\nresult in economic growth for new regions in countries, potentially at an\nexpense to the current economically-developed areas.6\n\n####\n\nThe WFH Revolution\n\nWe are just at the beginning of the WFH work organization revolution. Research\nhas already shown that WFH has profound impacts on the economy:\n\n  * It has enabled more people to find work and given them more work flexibility, including less time spent on commuting;\n\n  * It has reduced the \u2018motherhood\u2019 penalty, allowing women to both work and raise children, which will have long run positive economic outcomes;\n\n  * It may have opened new avenues for collaboration and innovation;\n\n  * It has transformed our decisions of where to live and where businesses open (residential areas vs city cores).\n\nAs our WFH-related technologies improve and work-organization continues to\nintegrate WFH, we should expect to see continued progress in the above listed\ndimensions. Younger generations that grow up with the WFH option will also be\nable to better adapt to this reality. This does not mean that WFH will, or\nshould, replace other forms of work organization. Office-based and colocation\nmodes will still be valuable. The right balance between WFH and office-based\nwork, along with improved worker training, will be struck in the future,\nincreasing both output and worker well-being. This will result in a better\nallocation of resources which will translate into economic growth.\n\nMy prediction that WFH will have a bigger impact than current AI is not based\non the fact that I don\u2019t believe AI will have significant benefits.7 It\u2019s more\nthat WFH is more akin to the economic shifts we saw with women entering the\nlabor force due to both improvement in women\u2019s rights and the development of\nhome appliances. Women entering the labor force made a profound change on the\neconomy, as the labor force doubled in a short span of time. The changes to\nthe economy that\u2019ll be brought up by WFH will be similar in nature, albeit\nlikely on a smaller scale.\n\nThere is a lot of excitement around AI, and how it might change the future. We\nneed to get as excited about the changes WFH will bring to the global economy.\n\nShare\n\n####\n\nInteresting Reads from the Week\n\n  1.

(July 15, 2023) \u2013 the Economist covered\nseveral work from home studies. The conclusions the Economist drew from them,\nhowever, were quite wrong. What did these studies actually say, and why work\nfrom home might be the optimal form of work.\n\nChatGPT and AI - Predictions on Labor and the Macroeconomy (April 3, 2023) \u2013\nwith many predicting AI technology will revolutionize work, how can we use\neconomic models and frameworks to think through the implications of this new\ntechnology, and why many predictions in the media are contradictory.\n\nSurvivorship Bias and Opinions (September 24, 2023) \u2013 we are typically unaware\nof how survivorship bias can influence our perception of the world. Not only\ndo we often see perspectives that \u2018survived\u2019, but we also make assumptions\nfrom our own experiences.\n\n1\n\nDisruptive research was measured by looking at citation patterns. A research\npaper typically cites other work. If a research paper (call it Research Paper\nA) cited a set of other papers (Research Paper B), but then future research\npapers (Research Paper C), cited Research Paper A but not Research Paper B,\nResearch Paper A would be considered \u2018disruptive\u2019.\n\n2\n\nThis result, that innovation dropped due to remote work, was heavily discussed\nin the media when it was reported in another paper.\n\n3\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that this improvement in disruptive innovation has\noccurred. As highlighted by WFH researcher Nick Bloom, the average office\ndistance between research team members has increased from 100km to a 1000km\nover the last 60 years.\n\n4\n\nThis difference suggests that it was not an economy wide effect, i.e. it was\neasier for everyone to become employed regardless of disability status, but\nrather the changes between 2019 and 2022 gave people with disabilities a\nhigher probability to become employed.\n\n5\n\nFor a 0.6 percentage point increase in the share of workers (with a particular\ncollege degree) that work from home, the gap in employment level between\nworking mothers and working women without children reduced by almost 0.8\npercentage points.\n\n6\n\nThe impacts could even be felt across countries if firms allow employees to\nwork from abroad. In the Fray and Presidente study on disruptive innovations,\nmany researchers already work across borders.\n\n7\n\nSome of my thoughts on how to predict the impact of AI can be found here.\nInterestingly, AI might even make WFH better, as AI might make WFH workers\nmore productive.\n\n### Subscribe to Nominal News\n\nLaunched a year ago\n\nApplication of economic research to real issues\n\n8 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n5 Restacks\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Work from Home Will Have a Bigger Impact on the Economy than AI\n\nwww.nominalnews.com\n\n4\n\nShare\n\n4 Comments\n\nThomas L.
