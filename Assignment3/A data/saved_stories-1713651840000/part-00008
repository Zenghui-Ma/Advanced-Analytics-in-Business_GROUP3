This biased emotion processing may\nunderlie core depression symptoms, including persistent feelings of sadness\nand a reduced capacity to experience pleasure. The neural mechanisms\nresponsible for this biased emotion processing remain unknown. Here we had a\nunique opportunity to record stereotactic electroencephalography signals in\nthe amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) from 5 patients with treatment-\nresistant depression (TRD) and 12 patients with epilepsy (as control) while\nthey participated in an affective bias task in which happy and sad faces were\nevaluated. First, compared with the control group, patients with TRD showed\nincreased amygdala responses to sad faces in the early stage (around 300 ms)\nand decreased amygdala responses to happy faces in the late stage (around 600\nms) following the onset of faces. Furthermore, during the late stage of happy-\nface processing, alpha-band activity in the PFC as well as alpha-phase locking\nbetween the amygdala and the PFC were significantly greater in patients with\nTRD compared with the control group. The increased amygdala activation during\nthe early stage of sad-face processing suggests an overactive bottom-up\nprocessing system in TRD. Meanwhile, the reduced amygdala response during the\nlate stage of happy-face processing could be attributed to increased top-down\ninhibition by the PFC through alpha-band oscillation, which may be relieved\nfollowing deep brain stimulation in the subcallosal cingulate and the ventral\ncapsule/ventral striatum.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### The relationship between emotional regulation and hemispheric\nlateralization in depression: a systematic review and a meta-analysis\n\nArticle Open access 16 April 2022\n\nNatia Horato, Laiana A.

Georg Northoff\n\n## Main\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by excessive low mood and a\nreduced capacity to experience pleasure. According to Beck\u2019s cognitive model\nof depression, the biased acquisition and processing of information have a\ncentral role in the development and maintenance of depression^1,2. Numerous\nstudies have shown that individuals with depression tend to have a negative\nbias across various cognitive domains, including perception^3,4, attention^5\nand memory^6. For example, individuals with depression tend to interpret\nneutral faces as sad, and happy faces as less happy^7. Understanding the\nneural mechanism responsible for the biased processing of emotional stimuli in\ndepression might bring important clinical benefits, including predicting,\ndetecting and treating depression.\n\nThe biased processing of emotional stimuli in depression has been linked to\ndysfunction in the amygdala^8,9, the prefrontal cortex (PFC)^10,11, the dorsal\nanterior cingulate^12,13 and their connections^14,15. Researchers have\nproposed that cognitive biases in depression are due to maladaptive bottom-up\nprocesses that can alter perceptions of the environment and social\ninteractions^16,17. Consistent with this hypothesis, functional MRI (fMRI)\nstudies have indicated that individuals with depression show potentiated\namygdala reactivity to sad faces and reduced responsiveness to happy faces,\neven in the absence of conscious awareness of the picture, suggesting\nautomatic mood-congruent cognitive biases in depression^18,19. However, a\ncorrelation between this automatic amygdala response and current depression\nseverity was observed only when processing happy faces, but not sad faces^18.\nOne possibility is that there are separate neural mechanisms that increase the\nsalience of negative stimuli and decrease the salience of positive or\nrewarding stimuli in depression. The reduced responsiveness of the amygdala to\nhappy faces in individuals with depression could be due to the overregulation\nof the amygdala by the PFC^16,20,21. Consistent with this hypothesis, an fMRI\nstudy using dynamic causal modelling found increased suppressive influences\nfrom the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex to the amygdala during classification\nof happy faces in depression^22. However, in other fMRI studies, individuals\nwith depression showed a widespread reduction in the functional connectivity\nbetween the amygdala and the PFC^14,23. In some studies, researchers even\nproposed that decreased PFC activity reduces nucleus accumbens and amygdala\nreactivity in people with depression, which, in turn, contributes to the\ninability to adaptively alter reward-seeking behaviour^24,25,26. Owing to the\npredominant use of methods with either high spatial and poor temporal\nresolution (for example, fMRI) or high temporal and poor spatial resolution\n(for example, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography) in\nprevious studies, the neural mechanism responsible for the biased processing\nof emotional stimuli in depression is far from fully understood. Here we use\nhuman intracranial stereotactic EEG (sEEG) recordings with high spatial and\ntemporal resolution to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that\ncontribute to the selective processing towards negative and away from positive\nstimuli in individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).\n\n## Results\n\nWe recorded local field potentials from the PFC (total of 180 contacts in the\nTRD group and 119 contacts in the control group) and the amygdala (36 contacts\nin the TRD group and 52 contacts in the control group; Table 1 and Fig. 1b) in\n5 patients with TRD and 12 patients with epilepsy while they participated in\nthe affective bias task in which happy and sad faces are rated (Fig. 1a).\nPatients with epilepsy are here viewed as the control group, because they\nrepresented a convenience cohort who have electrodes implanted inside the\nbrain and do not have TRD.\n\nTable 1 Number of recording contacts in each patient\n\nFull size table\n\nFig. 1: Experiment design and recording contact distribution.\n\na, Affective bias task. The stimulus set includes morphed faces from maximal\nemotional intensity to neutral (100% sad, 50% sad, 30% sad, 10% sad, neutral,\n10% happy, 30% happy, 50% happy and 100% happy). Participants were asked to\nrate the emotional intensity of each stimulus presented on the screen by\nclicking a location on the slider bar. b, Spatial distribution of recording\ncontacts across 5 patients with TRD and 12 control patients in the MNI space.\nTop: coronal view. Bottom: inferior view. Contacts within the PFC are black\nand contacts within the amygdala are blue. L, left; R, right. Only contacts in\nthe PFC and the amygdala are shown.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Temporal dynamics of amygdala responses in TRD\n\nGiven the central role of the amygdala in detecting and interpreting emotion\ninformation, we first examined the intracranial event-related potential (iERP)\nin the amygdala while participants rated sad and happy faces. The left, right\nand bilateral amygdala iERP responses to emotional faces from the two groups\nare shown in Fig. 2a. In each group and each condition, there is a large\nnegative potential peaking around 300 ms followed by a small positive\npotential. We define the duration of the large negative potential as the early\nstage of amygdala response and the small positive potential as the late stage\nof amygdala response (Fig. 2b). In all conditions (sad and happy), the early\nstage of amygdala response lasts longer in the TRD group compared with control\ngroup. Then, we calculated the peak amplitude of each stage in each group and\neach condition. We combined results from the left and right amygdala because\nsimilar results were obtained. The peak amplitude of the early stage was\nsignificantly larger in the TRD group compared with the control group during\nsad-face processing (Fig. 2c; TRD \u221212.9 \u00b1 1.7; control \u22127.5 \u00b1 1.1; t_86 =\n2.695, P = 0.009), but not during rating happy faces (Fig. 2c; TRD \u221211.0 \u00b1\n1.3; control \u22128.4 \u00b1 1.1; t_84 = 1.567, P = 0.121). Moreover, the peak\namplitude of the late stage was significantly smaller in patients with TRD\ncompared with the control group in the happy-face condition, but not in sad-\nface condition (Fig. 2c; happy faces: TRD 1.9 \u00b1 1.2; control 7.6 \u00b1 1.0; t_84 =\n3.610, P = 0.001; sad faces: TRD 7.6 \u00b1 1.0; control 6.7 \u00b1 1.0, t_86 = 0.651, P\n= 0.517). Thus, compared with the control group, patients with TRD showed\nincreased amygdala response to sad faces at an early latency and decreased\namygdala response to happy faces at a late latency.\n\nFig. 2: Amygdala iERP response to sad and happy faces.\n\na, Amygdala iERPs from 5 patients with TRD (20 contacts in left amygdala and\n16 contacts in right amygdala) and 12 control patients (34 contacts in left\namygdala and 18 contacts in right amygdala) to sad and happy faces were\naveraged across contacts.

The whiskers indicate 1.5 \u00d7 the interquartile range up to the\nminimum and maximum, and the points indicate outliers. The peak amplitude of\nthe early stage was significantly larger in the TRD group compared with the\ncontrol group during sad-face processing (t_86 = 2.695, P = 0.009). The peak\namplitude of the late stage was significantly smaller in patients with TRD\ncompared with the control group in the happy-face condition (t_84 = 3.610, P =\n0.001). *P < 0.05 (two-sided unpaired t-tests).\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\n### TRD shows greater alpha-band power in PFC at the late stage\n\nThe altered amygdala response we observed in patients with TRD could be due to\nthe regulation from the PFC. Previous EEG studies have reported altered\ncortical brain network in the alpha frequency band in MDD^27. Here we examined\nwhether alpha-band power (8\u201312 Hz) in the PFC, which may reflect excessive\ninhibitory processes^28,29,30,31,32, is enhanced or reduced in TRD at the\nearly or late stages. A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed\nsignificant main effects of emotion category (sad versus happy, F_(1,297) =\n17.67, P < 0.001), time window (early versus late, F_(1,297) = 29.51, P <\n0.0001) and patient group (TRD versus control, F_(1,297) = 8.230, P = 0.0044).\nThe significant interactions of time window by patient group (F_(1,297) =\n16.98, P < 0.0001) indicated that group difference was not the same at\ndifferent time windows. Subsequently, Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test showed\nsignificant differences between the TRD and control groups at the late stage\nof happy-face (adjusted P < 0.0001) and sad-face (adjusted P = 0.0325)\nprocessing (Fig. 3a). In summary, our results showed that there is no\ndifference in PFC alpha-band power between the TRD and the control groups at\nthe early stage. However, at the late stage, patients with TRD showed\nsignificantly greater alpha-band power in the PFC than the control group, no\nmatter which emotional faces (sad or happy) were processed. The distribution\nof alpha-band power at the late stage in each group is shown in Fig. 3b.\n\nFig. 3: Alpha-band activity.\n\na, Averaged alpha-band power in the PFC across 180 contacts in the TRD group\nand 119 contacts in the control group.

To study this\nhypothesis, we measured changes in the phase-locking value (PLV) of alpha\noscillations between the amygdala and the PFC during sad-face and happy-face\nprocessing, which is a measure of connectivity between two regions. Only a\nsubset of patients (N_TRD = 5, N_control = 8) with at least one contact in\nboth the amygdala and the PFC were involved in this data analysis. The TRD\ngroup showed a greater PLV during happy-face trials than the control group\nfrom 608 ms to 792 ms (Fig. 3c; cluster-based permutation test with a cluster\nthreshold P < 0.05). No time cluster expressing a significant group difference\nwas observed in the sad-face condition (Fig. 3c). In addition, we calculated\nthe mean PLV within the late stage of happy-face processing, and the results\nshowed that the alpha-band PLV between the PFC and amygdala is significantly\nhigher in the TRD group than in the control group (Fig. 3d; unpaired t-test,\nt_11 = 3.953, P = 0.0023). To exclude the possibility that the increased PLV\nin the TRD group is due to the larger number of contacts in the TRD group than\nin the control group, we matched the number of contacts in the two groups and\ncalculated the PLV as before. Specifically, we randomly selected 5 contacts in\nthe amygdala and 11 contacts in the PFC in each patient with TRD to reduce the\nnumber of total contacts involved in the PLV analysis. The same results were\nobserved after matching the number of contacts in the TRD and the control\ngroup (Extended Data Fig. 1).\n\nIn summary, our results revealed separate neural mechanisms for the biased\nprocessing of emotional stimuli in TRD (Fig. 4). When individuals with TRD\nprocess sad faces, they show a larger amygdala iERP response at the early\nstage than control individuals. While processing happy faces, patients with\nTRD show a decreased amygdala iERP response, increased alpha-band power in the\nPFC and enhanced alpha-band synchrony between these two regions at the late\nstage, compared with the control group.\n\nFig. 4: Summary of the results in patients with TRD.\n\nThe arrows indicate higher or lower signal in the TRD group than in the\ncontrol group.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Deep brain stimulation altered the neural responses to emotional stimuli\nin the TRD group\n\nAll five patients with TRD were asked to perform the affective bias task again\nafter receiving deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subcallosal cingulate\n(SCC) and the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) (Fig. 5a). We recorded\nand analysed local field potentials from sEEG contacts in the PFC and amygdala\nas before. First, amygdala iERP responses to sad and happy faces were\nsignificantly increased after DBS in a late time window (Fig. 5b; sad, 563\u2013713\nms; happy, 598\u2013796 ms; cluster-based permutation test with cluster threshold P\n< 0.05). The shape of the early-stage amygdala iERP response was not changed\nby DBS. Second, the alpha-band power in the PFC was significantly reduced\nafter DBS in both the early and late stages when patients with TRD process\nhappy faces (Fig. 5c; TRD pre-DBS happy early versus TRD post-DBS happy early,\nadjusted P < 0.001; TRD pre-DBS happy late versus TRD post-DBS happy late,\nadjusted P < 0.001). Interestingly, patients with TRD did not show changed\nalpha-band power in the PFC at any stage in the sad-face condition (Fig. 5c;\nTRD pre-DBS sad early versus TRD post-DBS sad early, adjusted P = 0.993; TRD\npre-DBS sad late versus TRD post-DBS sad late, adjusted P = 0.9474). Third, in\nthe happy-face condition, the PLV was reduced to an intermediate pattern\nbetween TRD pre-DBS and the control group. Overall, after DBS in the SCC and\nVC/VS, the amygdala iERP response, PFC alpha-band power and the PLV between\nthe amygdala and PFC during the processing of happy faces in patients with TRD\nlooked more like those observed in the control group.\n\nFig. 5: Neural responses altered by DBS.\n\na, Schematic of DBS leads placement in 5 patients with TRD. b\u2013d, Data from the\ncontrol group are shown again here as a reference (grey), but not included in\nthe statistical analysis. b, Amygdala iERP responses to sad and happy faces\nwere averaged across contacts for each group (TRD pre-DBS, control and TRD\npost-DBS). The pink horizontal bar below means significant difference between\nTRD pre-DBS and TRD post-DBS. The shaded area indicates s.e.m. c, Averaged\nalpha-band power in the PFC across contacts. A three-way ANOVA revealed\nsignificant main effects of DBS (pre versus post, F_(1,179) = 20.14, P <\n0.0001), significant interactions of DBS effect by emotion category (F_(1,179)\n= 26.69, P < 0.0001) and stage (F_(1,179) = 9.209, P = 0.0028). Sidak\u2019s\nmultiple comparisons test showed significant differences between TRD pre-DBS\nand TRD post-DBS at the early (adjusted P < 0.0001) and late (adjusted P <\n0.0001) stages of happy-face processing. *Adjusted P < 0.05. Data are\npresented as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Each dot indicates a single contact (N_TRD = 180;\nN_control = 119). d, Averaged time courses (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.) of alpha-band PLV\nchanges from baseline across participants (TRD pre-DBS, control and TRD post-\nDBS).\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\n## Discussion\n\nWith the help of the excellent spatial and temporal resolution of sEEG, we\nobserved that increased amygdala responses to sad faces emerged at an early\nstage (around 300 ms), while decreased amygdala responses to happy faces\nemerged at a late stage (around 600 ms). Importantly, during this late stage\nof decreased amygdala responses to happy faces, we found increased alpha-band\nactivity in the PFC, as well as greater alpha-phase locking between the\namygdala and the PFC in patients with TRD compared with the controls. After\nthe delivery of stimulation to two hubs that connect cortical and subcortical\nnetwork regions relevant to the expression of depressive symptoms, the\natypical amygdala and PFC activity, along with their connections while rating\nhappy faces in patients with TRD looked more like those observed in the\ncontrol group. Thus, our results provide important direct electrophysiological\nevidence for the neural mechanisms underlying the biased processing of\nemotional stimuli in depression. The increased amygdala iERP response during\nthe early stage of rating sad faces suggests an overactive bottom-up\nprocessing system. While the reduced amygdala iERP response during the late\nstage of rating happy faces may be attributed to increased top-down inhibition\nby the PFC through alpha-band oscillation.\n\nThe amygdala has a critical role in emotion processing and response. It\ninteracts with a variety of cortical and subcortical areas, which together\nevaluate the salience of sensory stimuli and modify the response of the\namygdala^33. Numerous fMRI studies have shown that individuals with depression\nshow an increased amygdala response to sad faces and a decreased amygdala\nresponse to happy faces compared with healthy controls^8,19,34. Our iERP\nresults clearly showed that patients with TRD showed heightened and prolonged\namygdala activity in response to sad faces, compared with the control group.\nMore interestingly, the iERP traces from patients with TRD and the control\npatients are almost overlapping before 200 ms, suggesting no difference in the\ninitial response to sad faces in the amygdala. This finding aligns with the\ntheory that individuals with and without depression do not primarily differ in\ntheir initial response to negative events but in their ability to recover from\nthe ensuing negative affect^35. In addition, we also observed prolonged\nactivity in the amygdala during the early stage of happy-face processing,\nalthough without a significant change in amplitude compared with the controls.\nOverall, the longer-lasting amygdala response observed in our study could be\nrelated to the extended elaborative processing of emotional information in\ndepression^36.\n\nThe increased amygdala iERP we observed at the early stage during sad-face\nprocessing in the TRD group supports the hypothesis that increased amygdala\nactivity creates a bottom-up signal that biases negative information\nprocessing in higher cortical areas and can maladaptively alter perceptions of\nthe environment^19. The altered perception of negative information has been\nassociated with decreased cognitive control from the dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex^20,37,38. Another possibility could be that the reduced connectivity\nbetween the thalamus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex leads to a higher\nflow of information through the subgenual cingulate cortex. This, in turn,\nheightens the emotional impact of incoming stimuli for individuals with\ndepression^3,12. As individuals with depression often show an attentional bias\nfor sad stimuli^5, it is still unclear how the increased amygdala response to\nnegative stimuli is related to the inefficient attentional disengagement from\nnegative stimuli.\n\nIn the current study, patients with TRD show decreased amygdala response,\nincreased alpha-band power in the PFC and enhanced alpha synchrony between\nthese two regions at the late stage of happy-face processing, compared with\nthe control group. Thus, the reduced amygdala response to happy faces in the\nTRD group could be due to the inhibition from the PFC. Consistent with our\nfindings, an fMRI study examined the functional connectivity between the\namygdala and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex using dynamic causal modelling,\nand identified increased negative left-sided top-down orbitomedial prefrontal\ncortex\u2013amygdala effective connectivity in response to happy faces^22. The\nconnectivity results suggest increased inhibition of the left amygdala by the\nleft orbitomedial prefrontal cortex in response to positive emotional stimuli.\nIn addition, increased alpha-band power in the PFC of individuals with\ndepression has been reported in previous EEG studies^27,39,40. This heightened\nalpha activity may reflect excessive inhibitory processes, which could\ncontribute to the cognitive and emotional symptoms associated with depression.\nConsistent with this idea, a clinical improvement after antidepressant\ntreatments was also found to be associated with a decrease in PFC alpha-band\nactivity^41,42.\n\nWith the help of the high temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial EEG,\nour results support that separate neural mechanisms are responsible for the\nbiased negative and positive affective information processing in depression.\nThe observed effect of DBS also provides evidence for this hypothesis.\nSpecifically, after DBS in the SCC and VC/VS, both the alpha-band power in the\nPFC and the alpha-band PLV between the PFC and amygdala during happy-face\nprocessing were reduced. However, DBS has little effect on PFC alpha-band\npower and alpha-band PLV between the PFC and amygdala during sad-face\nprocessing. Consistent with our results, decreased positive emotion rather\nthan exaggerated responses to negative stimuli is thought to be a distinctive\nfeature of depression. For example, amygdala activity during happy-face\nprocessing or positive recall was negatively correlated with current\ndepression severity^18,43. But no significant correlation between amygdala\nactivity during sad-face processing and current depression severity was\nobserved in those studies. Also, it is worth noting that a negative processing\nbias also exists in high-risk populations of depression and individuals with\nanxiety^43,44. Similarly, some studies have proposed that amygdala\nhyperactivity during negative autobiographical recall is a trait-like marker\nof depression, while amygdala hypoactivity during positive autobiographical\nrecall is a state marker that emerges during active disease and returns to\nnormal with symptom remission^43.\n\nConverging evidence suggests an important role of amygdala in the recovery\nfrom MDD. In some studies, individuals with MDD have been trained to regulate\ntheir amygdala haemodynamic response during real-time fMRI neurofeedback\ntraining^45. After training, the amygdala haemodynamic response to positive\nmemories or happy faces was increased and depressive symptoms were reduced,\nsuggesting a recovery from depression. In patients with MDD after sertraline\ntreatment, hyperactivation of the amygdala to masked sad faces decreased and\nhypoactivation of the amygdala to masked happy faces increased^19. Consistent\nwith these findings, our results also showed that the processing bias of happy\nfaces looks more like the control group after DBS. Together with previous\nfindings, the decreased activation of the amygdala to positive stimuli may\nindicate clinical significance and some antidepressant drugs or cognitive\ntherapies exert their treatment effect by normalizing this emotional\nprocessing.\n\nIntracranial recordings in patients with TRD before and after DBS parameter\nexploration allowed this extraordinary opportunity to study the neural\nmechanism of biased processing of emotional stimuli in depression, but some\nlimitations must be acknowledged. For example, we use patients with epilepsy\nas the control group in our study because it is impossible to get sEEG data\nfrom healthy humans. Patients with epilepsy often show a range of depressive\ncomorbidities^46; however, none of the patients included in this study was\ndiagnosed with TRD. Although the 12 patients with epilepsy used as the control\ngroup showed a range of depression from minimal to severe, we have identified\na significant difference between the TRD and control groups. If there is a\ncontrol group in which all participants have completely no depression, we\nwould get same conclusion but with larger difference and stronger statistical\npower. Another limitation is that a conclusive behavioural result was not\nobtained due to the small number of patients with TRD involved in our study.\nUnlike intracranial EEG data in which multiple electrodes are placed inside\nthe brain to record electrical activity directly, an adequate sample size of\npatients is necessary for a conclusive behavioural result, especially when\ncomparing between groups. However, there is substantial behavioural evidence\nshowing that individuals with MDD show blunted responsiveness to happy faces\nand an increased tendency to interpret neutral faces as sad^47,48,49,50. The\nincreased amygdala iERP response to sad faces and decreased amygdala iERP\nresponse to happy faces observed in our study are consistent with these\npreviously reported negative cognitive bias in depression. The third\nlimitation is that the spatial coverage of electrodes in patients with TRD in\nthe frontal lobe is limited with respect to the epilepsy cohort due to\ndifferences in the surgical targets, driven uniquely by clinical purposes. As\na consequence, our ability to resolve the contribution of different PFC\nsubdivisions was not possible in the current study, and further evidence is\nneeded to pinpoint the exact source of the PFC inhibitory effects.\nNonetheless, our results investigated the functional profile of amygdala, PFC\nand their connectivity in affective processing and provide direct\nelectrophysiological evidence with high spatial and temporal resolution to\nunderstand the critical framework for the biased acquisition and processing of\ninformation, which has a primary role in the development and maintenance of\ndepression.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Participants\n\nData were obtained from 12 patients with epilepsy (7 female, 5 male, age\n19\u201357) and 5 patients with TRD (3 female, 2 male, age 32\u201356). Twelve patients\nwith epilepsy were undergoing sEEG monitoring at Baylor College of Medicine\nfor seizure localization before surgical resection. All participants with\nepilepsy completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms (Beck Depression\nInventory-II (BDI-II)^51) and their BDI-II scores show a distribution from\nminimal to severe depression (Extended Data Fig. 2). The average BDI-II score\nwas 21.17 \u00b1 11.7 (mean \u00b1 s.d.). Participants with TRD involved in this study\n(N = 5) were enroled in an early feasibility trial (ClinicalTrials.gov\nIdentifier: NCT03437928) of individualized DBS guided by intracranial\nrecordings^52. All five patients with TRD have a DSM-5^53 diagnosis of MDD as\ntheir primary diagnosis and failed to respond to a minimum of four adequate\ndepression treatments from at least two different treatment medication\ncategories (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant, monoamine\noxidase inhibitors, and so on). One week before operation in patients with\nTRD, MADRS (Montgomery\u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and HAM-D (Hamilton\nDepression Rating Scale) were administered by the clinician to assess the\nseverity of depression. All patients with TRD had a MADRS score above 27 and a\nHAM-D score above 20. Participants with history of psychosis, personality\ndisorder, recent suicide attempt or neurodegenerative disorders were excluded\nfrom recruitment. Each patient with TRD was implanted with ten temporary sEEG\nelectrodes for neural recordings and four permanent DBS leads for stimulation\ndelivery (DBS leads are shown in Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). sEEG\nelectrodes in patients with TRD were used to conduct a thorough search of\nstimulation parameter space to build a comprehensive understanding of the\npathophysiology of TRD, as well as the neural responses to stimulation\ntherapy^52. This clinical trial is funded by the NIH Brain Research Through\nAdvancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative (UH3 NS103549) and\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration (IDE number G180300). All the\nexperiments in this paper involving patients with epilepsy and patients with\nTRD were approved by the institutional review board at Baylor College of\nMedicine (IRB: H-43036, IRB: H-18112). Written informed consent was obtained\nfrom each participant. The patients were paid US$100 per day.\n\n### Electrode implantation and localization\n\nDBS leads (Cartesia, Boston Scientific) and sEEG electrodes (Depthalon, PMT)\nwere implanted using a robotic surgical assistant (Zimmer Biomet). The\nlocations of sEEG electrodes in patients with epilepsy were entirely based on\nmedical considerations (detection of the seizure foci). Each 0.8-mm-diameter\nsEEG electrode contains 12\u201316 independent recording contacts. Contacts (2 mm\nin length) are spaced 1.5 mm apart from one another, edge to edge. All\npatients with epilepsy involved in our study have at least one electrode in\nthe PFC or amygdala. Each patient with TRD had ten sEEG electrodes (five per\nhemisphere in the prefrontal and mesial temporal regions) and four DBS leads\n(VC/VS and SCC bilaterally). The surgery procedure and DBS leads information\ncan be found in a previously published study^52. Following surgical\nimplantation, electrodes were localized by co-registration of pre-surgery\nanatomical T1 MRI scans and post-implantation computed tomography scans using\nFreeSurfer Version 6 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). Electrode positions\nwere manually marked using BioImage Suite^54. iELVis^55 was used to overlay\nelectrode location into the MRI. Electrodes were then assigned to the PFC and\namygdala by independent expert visual inspection. We projected electrode\npositions onto Montreal Neurological Institute-152 template brain (MNI) space\nand displayed on the cortical surface of FreeSurfer \u2018fsaverage\u2019 brain for\nvisualization in Fig. 1b.\n\n### Affective bias task\n\nParticipants in our study were asked to rate emotional human face photographs,\nwhich were displayed on a Viewsonic VP150 monitor with a resolution of 1,920 \u00d7\n1,080, positioned 57 cm from the participants. Happy, sad and neutral face\nexemplars (6 identities each; 3 male, 3 female) adapted from the NimStim Face\nStimulus Set^56 were morphed using a Delaunay tessellation matrix to generate\nsubtle facial expressions ranging in emotional intensity from neutral to\nmaximally expressive in steps of 10%, 30%, 50% and 100% for happy and sad\nfaces, respectively (Fig. 1a). The experiment was programmed in MATLAB R2019a,\nusing Psychtoolbox-3^57.\n\nIn each trial, a white fixation cross was displayed on a black background for\n1,000 ms (jittered \u00b1 100 ms) and then a face and a rating prompt appeared\nsimultaneously on the screen, positioned on the left and right sides,\nrespectively (as illustrated in Fig. 1a). Participants were asked to indicate\ntheir rating by clicking a specific location on the slider bar using a\ncomputer mouse. The ratings were recorded using a continuous scale that ranged\nfrom 0 (\u2018Very sad\u2019) to 0.5 (\u2018Neutral\u2019) to 1 (\u2018Very happy\u2019). Stimuli were\npresented in a blocked design in which all happy faces (plus neutral) appeared\nin one block while all sad faces (plus neutral) appeared in a separate block.\nThere were 30 trials in each block (6 trials for each intensity level).\nParticipants completed three alternating happy and sad blocks. The order of\nhappy and sad blocks was counterbalanced across participants. Patients with\nTRD underwent sEEG research for 10 days in the epilepsy monitoring unit and\nthey performed the affective bias task twice after surgical implantation, at\nday 1 or day 2 (before DBS parameter exploration) and day 8 or day 9 (after\nDBS parameter exploration). Patients with epilepsy completed the task during\ntheir in-patient stay (at least 2 hours after any seizure activity was\ndetected). Trials with obvious wrong clicks (for example, 100% happy faces\nwere labelled very sad: 1.5% in control group; 1.4% in TRD group), which\nindicated that the patients were distracted from doing the task, were excluded\nfrom data analysis.\n\n### Data acquisition and preprocessing\n\nIntracranial EEG data were recorded during affective bias task using Cerebus\ndata acquisition system (Blackrock Neurotech). All neural signals were\nrecorded at a 2,000 Hz sampling rate (online band-pass filter 0.3\u2013500 Hz) with\na 256-channel amplifier and referenced to a contact in the white matter. Some\nruns of patient DBSTRD010 were collected at 30 kHz for reasons pertaining to\nother studies and were downsampled to 2,000 Hz. A photodiode was placed in the\nlower right-hand corner of the screen to mark the trial onset and its analogue\nvoltage response was recorded by the data acquisition system to ensure precise\nsynchronization. Electrode contacts and epochs contaminated with excessive\nartefacts and epileptiform activity were removed from data analysis by visual\ninspection. After that, the continuous intracranial EEG data in each electrode\ncontact was notch-filtered at 60 Hz, re-referenced to the common average\nreference and segmented from \u2212500 ms to 1,000 ms relative to stimulus onset.\nNeutral face epochs in each block were removed from data analysis.\nIntracranial EEG data were analysed using MNE-Python^58 v1.6\n(https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) and MATLAB R2023a.\n\n### Quantification and statistical analysis\n\n#### Event-related potentials\n\nThe segmented data were band-pass filtered from 1 Hz to 30 Hz using a finite\nimpulse response filter (MNE-Python^58). iERPs were calculated for each\ncondition (happy and sad), each group (TRD, control) and each contact by\naveraging the filtered epochs and normalizing them to the mean signal of\nbaseline period (\u2212500 ms to 0 ms relative to stimulus onset). The iERP time\ncourses were averaged across contacts within the left amygdala, right amygdala\nand bilateral amygdala for each condition (Fig. 2a). The data from two\ncontacts in patient Dep3 in happy blocks was excluded from time course and\namplitude analysis as an extreme outlier (>8 s.d. away from the mean). On the\nbasis of the averaged amygdala iERP waveform across contacts, we defined the\nduration of the large negative potential as the early stage of amygdala\nresponse and the small positive potential as the late stage of amygdala\nresponse. Specifically, the duration of the early and late stages of amygdala\nresponse are defined as same polarity time points surrounding the peak of\nnegative potential and positive potential, respectively (Fig. 2b). The peak\namplitude of each stage was calculated as the average amplitude within a 150\nms time window of the peak (Fig. 2c). Group differences in peak amplitude were\ntested with two-tailed unpaired t-test.\n\n#### Power analysis\n\nFor each recording contact, alpha-band power was estimated for the early stage\nand the late stage. We band-pass filtered the data (8\u201312 Hz, IIR filter),\napplied the Hilbert transform to extract analytic amplitude envelope, squared\nthe results and normalized them by calculating percent change from pre-\nstimulus baseline (\u2212500 ms to 0 ms). The results shown in Fig. 3a were\naveraged across all the contacts for each group and each condition. We\nperformed three-way ANOVA (emotion category \u00d7 time window \u00d7 patient group) on\nthe alpha-band power data. Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used to\nestimate the differences between the TRD and control groups.\n\n#### Inter-regional phase synchrony\n\nThe PLV^59 was calculated for each contact pair between the PFC and amygdala.\nOnly a subset of patients with at least one contact in both the amygdala and\nthe PFC were involved in data analysis (N_TRD = 5, N_control = 8). The average\nBDI-II score of the control group was 14.00 \u00b1 4.23 (mean \u00b1 s.d.). The\npreprocessed data were alpha-band filtered (8\u201312 Hz) using a finite impulse\nresponse filter (order, 4 cycles of the desired signal). Then Hilbert\ntransform was applied and the PLV was calculated for each contact pair and\nnormalized to the baseline (\u2212500 ms to 0 ms). The results shown in Fig. 3c\nwere averaged across participants. For each condition (sad and happy), we\nstatistically compared the PLVs between the TRD and control groups using a\ncluster-based permutation test (N = 10,000, cluster P < 0.05, Bonferroni\ncorrected). We also compared the mean PLV of happy-face trials during the late\nstage (TRD, from 563 ms to 740 ms; control, from 453 ms to 765 ms) between the\nTRD and control groups (unpaired t-test).\n\n### DBS stimulation\n\nThe DBS leads were positioned to the target region (SCC and VC/VS) using\npreviously described methodology based on patient-specific diffusion-weighted\nimaging data^60. DBS parameter exploration was initiated 3 days after surgery\n(surgery day is day 0) in patients with TRD as described in the clinical\nprotocol (Food and Drug Administration IDE number G180300). We delivered\nstimulation to the target regions using different parameter sets (Cerestim,\nBlackrock Microsystems) from day 3 to day 8 or day 9. We tested a wide range\nof parameter space by varying stimulation target (left SCC, right SCC, left\nVC/VS, right VC/VS), frequency (6 Hz, 50 Hz, 130 Hz), amplitude (2 mA, 5 mA)\nand pulse width (50 \u03bcs, 100 \u03bcs, 180 \u03bcs). We also varied the contact\nconfiguration (that is, the combination of DBS contacts through which\nstimulation was delivered) by separately testing the bottom bullet-shaped\ncontact, top ring contact and three \u2018stacks\u2019 of segmented contacts in the\nmiddle two levels on the VC/VS leads (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for a picture\nof DBS lead^61 and an example stimulation parameter set). For the SCC leads,\nwe additionally tested the middle two segmented levels. We tested all\ncombinations of these parameters across the four DBS leads^52. After DBS\nparameter exploration, patients with TRD were asked to perform affective bias\ntask again at day 8 or day 9, during which all the stimulation was turned off.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data that support the key findings are available on Open Science Framework\nat https://osf.io/93wf2/ (ref. ^62).

Yellow shade area indicates\nthe time window in which responses to each stimulus type (sad and happy faces)\nare significantly different between TRD and control group with a cluster\nthreshold of p < 0.05. (b) During the late stage of happy face processing, TRD\npatients display stronger PLV between PFC and amygdala than control patients\n(t_11 = 3.094, p = 0.0102). Data are presented as mean values \u00b1 SEM. Each dot\nmeans a single participant. * p < 0.05 (two-sided unpaired t tests). PLV,\nphase locking value. N_TRD = 5, N_control =8.\n\nSource data\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Depression severity based on BDI-II score.\n\nBDI-II scores across the 12 epilepsy patients exhibit a distribution from\nminimal to severe depression.\n\nSource data\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 DBS lead and stimulation parameter.\n\n(a) Contact arrangement for the Boston Scientific directional 8-contact lead.\n(b) An example of deep brain stimulation parameter set. The blue squares\nindicate the combination of DBS contacts through which stimulation was\ndelivered.\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n### Reporting Summary\n\n## Source data\n\n### Source Data Fig. 2\n\nStatistical source data.\n\n### Source Data Fig. 3\n\nStatistical source data.\n\n### Source Data Fig. 5\n\nStatistical source data.\n\n### Source Data Extended Data Fig. 1\n\nStatistical source data.\n\n### Source Data Extended Data Fig. 2\n\nStatistical source data.\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
