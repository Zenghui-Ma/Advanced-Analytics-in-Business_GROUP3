This paper concludes that\nPinocchio could only sustain 13 lies in a row before the maximum upward force\nhis neck could exert cannot sustain his head and nose. The head\u2019s overall\ncentre of mass shifts over 85 metres after 13 lies, and the overall length of\nthe nose is 208 metres.\n\n#### Keywords\n\nBook; Film; Mechanics; Material properties; Pinocchio\n\n#### Full Text:\n\nPDF\n\n#### References\n\nDisneyWiki, \u201cPinocchio,\u201d 2013.
