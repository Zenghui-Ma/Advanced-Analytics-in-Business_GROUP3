I wrote about this in-depth at Forge.\n\nI also recently heard Paul Ford and Rich Ziade describe the office as a tool,\nwhich reminded me of a story from my student days, about how the library was a\ntool for me to work through burnout and study:\n\nBetween my freshman summer and my sophomore year in college, I experienced my\nfirst\u2014and maybe worst\u2014serious burnout. As I was working through it and\nrecovering, and figuring out a more sustainable method of working and\nstudying, I noticed that a lot of my friends purposely went to the library to\nstudy.\n\nThis was a habit I didn\u2019t have. I didn\u2019t like the library much at all. The\nbathrooms were gross, the food situation was inconvenient, and it would take\nme at least 20 minutes to commute there and often another 10 to find a decent\nspot. My roommate in first year, also a good friend, seemed to be able to\nstudy at home just fine\u2014with Messenger tools open, music playing, and such. I\ntried doing the same, but it just didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nSo, desperate times called for desperate measures. Studying at home wasn\u2019t\nworking for me like it did for my roommate, so against my preferences, I\nstarted commuting to the library. I noticed the nicest library, focused on\narts and humanities, was particularly social, so I usually avoided that\none\u2014and instead I went to the science library.\n\nThat habit completely changed the experience of studying. First, I realized\nthat a lot of people studied really hard. I would often go near the opening\nhour, to spare myself the time of having to find a seat, and see people there\nbefore me. The library was extremely quiet, so I also stayed quiet and opened\nmy books. It felt normal that I should be there; it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I would\neventually run into friends there and we\u2019d save each other seats. I knew I was\nexpected at the library, which meant I should probably show up.\n\nAt home, I would easily spend an hour or two on social media and YouTube\ninstead of studying. But because there were so many people studying seriously\nat the library, I\u2019d feel embarrassed if they saw me doing that\u2014so being at the\nlibrary also curbed my tendency to procrastinate on the internet.\n\nWhile studying at home felt like pulling teeth, it felt completely effortless\nwhen I got to the library. If I studied at home it would take a few hours, and\nI\u2019d feel completely exhausted after. If I studied at the library, I\u2019d get the\nsame amount done in an hour or two, and I\u2019d feel satisfied and energized. I\nwould be in good shape to go to the gym, or catch up with a friend I ran into,\nor something else.\n\nGoing to the library solved the vast majority of my problems. I would get\nthrough my next two years in college and graduate with honors. It turns out\nthat getting my shoes on and out the door to the library was way more\neffective than trying to pull out a textbook and flip it open at home.\n\nAs a student, the library was a tool for me to study with practically no\nwillpower needed, and to build a peer group.\n\nNowadays, I still often rely on places as I would rely on tools for leverage.\nThe library is still a tool for me to write and work. The Figma office is a\ntool for me to work. The gym is a tool for me to exercise. My home is a place\nfor me to relax, not a place for me to work.\n\nWhenever I feel like I\u2019m thrashing on the keyboard at home, and panic at how\nlittle I got done, I stop. I take a breath. I walk over to another\nplace\u2014downstairs to the library, to a coffee shop, or to another workspace\u2014and\nthe work comes out almost effortlessly.\n\nSee also habit fields and working by hand.\n\nHerbert Lui\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\nAround the World, Creativity, Figma, Life\n\n\u2190 It\u2019s still hard\n\n\u2192 Lightning in a bottle\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nProudly Powered by WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
