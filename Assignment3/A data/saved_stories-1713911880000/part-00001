Indigenous leaders are calling\nfor a moratorium before it's too late.\n\nEmilie Holtet / NTB / AFP via Getty Images\n\nMaria Parazo Rose Spatial Data Analyst\n\nPublished\n\n    Apr 22, 2024\n\nTopic\n\n    Climate + Global Indigenous Affairs Desk\n\nShare/Republish\n\n    \n\nCopy Link Republish\n\nCopy Link Email SMS Twitter Facebook\n\nRepublish Reddit LinkedIn\n\nThis story is published as part of the Global Indigenous Affairs Desk, an\nIndigenous-led collaboration between Grist, High Country News, ICT, Mongabay,\nNative News Online, and APTN.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Tom Goldtooth has listened to conversations about the\nnegative impacts fossil fuels and carbon markets have on Indigenous peoples.\nOn Wednesday, Goldtooth and the Indigenous Environmental Network, or IEN,\ncalled for a permanent end to carbon markets. Beyond being an ineffective tool\nfor mitigating climate change, the organization argues; they harm, exploit,\nand divide Native communities around the world.\n\nThe recommendation was delivered to a crowd of Indigenous activists,\npolicymakers, and leaders at the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, or\nUNPFII, and is the most comprehensive moratorium on the issue the panel has\never heard. If adopted, the position would pressure other United Nations\nagencies \u2014 like the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC \u2014\nto take a similar stance. The heightened urgency stems from the COP29\ngathering planned later this year, when provisions in the 2015 Paris Climate\nAgreement on carbon market structures are expected to be finalized.\n\n\u201cWe are long overdue for a moratorium on false climate solutions like carbon\nmarkets,\u201d said Goldtooth, who is Din\u00e9 and Dakota and executive director of\nIEN. \u201cIt\u2019s a life and death situation with our people related to the\nmitigation solutions that are being negotiated, especially under Article 6 of\nthe Paris Agreement. Article 6 is all about carbon markets, which is a\nsmokescreen, which is a loophole [that keeps] fossil fuel polluters from\nagreeing to phase out carbon.\u201d\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Tamra\nGilbertson, the organization\u2019s climate justice program coordinator and\nresearcher, said a false climate solution is anything that looks like a tool\nfor reducing emissions or fighting climate change but allows extractive\ncompanies to continue profiting from the fossil fuels driving the crisis.\n\n\u201cCarbon markets have been set up by the polluting industries,\u201d Gilbertson\nsaid. \u201cThe premise of carbon markets as a good mitigation outcome or a good\nmitigation program for the UNFCCC is in and of itself a flawed concept. And we\nknow that because of who\u2019s put it together.\u201d\n\nThe carbon market moratorium the network called for would end carbon dioxide\nremoval projects like carbon capture and storage; forest, soil, and ocean\noffsets; nature-based solutions; debt-for-nature swaps; biodiversity offsets;\nand other geoengineering technologies.\n\nThis year\u2019s moratorium recommendation builds on a similar proposal the IEN\noffered at last year\u2019s forum, when it called for a stop to carbon markets\nuntil Indigenous communities could \u201cthoroughly investigate the impacts and\nmake appropriate demands.\u201d That call led to an international meeting in\nJanuary, where Native experts discussed the impacts a green economy has and\nwould have on their communities. Ultimately, the participants produced a\nreport detailing how green economy projects and initiatives can create a new\nway to colonize Indigenous Peoples\u2019 lands and territories.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nDar\u00edo Jos\u00e9 Mej\u00eda Montalvo, of the Zen\u00fa Tribe in Colombia, participated in the\nJanuary meeting and has chaired a previous UNPFII. He highlighted the report\nduring a U.N. session last week.\n\n\u201cThe transition toward a green economy [keeps] starting from the same\nextractivist-based logic that prioritizes the private sector, which is guided\nby national economic interests of multinationals, which ignores the fights of\nIndigenous people, the fight against climate change, and the fight against\npoverty,\u201d Montalvo said, according to a U.N. translation of a speech he\ndelivered in Spanish.\n\nDario Jose Mejia Montalvo speaks during an interview with AFP at the Amazon\nDialogues Seminar on August 6, 2023. Evaristo Sa / AFP via Getty Images\n\nGoldtooth and Gilbertson say that, while the January report established wider\nconsensus around the negative impacts of the green economy, the IEN felt that\nthe report\u2019s recommendations were unclear and did not go far enough to\ndiscourage the growth of carbon markets \u2014 which is why the organization is\ncalling for a permanent moratorium.\n\n\u201cWe have to do everything that we can from every direction we possibly can in\nthis climate emergency that we\u2019re in, because we don\u2019t have a lot more time,\u201d\nGilbertson said. If carbon markets are enshrined in Article 6 of the Paris\nAgreement as they are currently written and become a more powerful\ninternational network, \u201cwe are in a whole new era of linked-up global carbon\nmarkets like we\u2019ve never seen before. And then we\u2019re stuck with it.\u201d\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries submit plans detailing how they will\nreduce emissions or increase carbon sequestration. Article 6 provides pathways\nfor nations to cooperate on a voluntary basis and trade emissions to achieve\ntheir climate goals. More specifically, paragraph 6.4 would create a\ncentralized market and lead to large-scale implementation of emission\nreductions trading. The nuances of these structures and how carbon markets are\npresented in Article 6 has far-reaching impacts: A report released in November\nby the International Emissions Trading Association, or IETA, showed that 80\npercent of all countries indicate they will or would use carbon markets to\nmeet their climate goals.\n\nIn its current form, carbon offset projects as described in Article 6 of the\nParis Agreement would further threaten Indigenous land tenure and access to\nresources. If finalized in November, pilot projects are expected to start as\nsoon as January 2025.\n\nAt this year\u2019s forum, organizations like the United Nations Development\nProgram, Climate Focus, Forests Peoples Programme, and Rainforest U.S.\ndiscussed new initiatives to protect Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights within a\ncarbon market. In particular, there\u2019s increased attention on policies that\nwould more effectively incorporate free, prior, and informed consent, or FPIC,\ninto carbon offset operations. But Kimaren Riamit, executive director of\nILEPA-Kenya, an Indigenous-led nonprofit, said the foundation that must be\nestablished even before FPIC is better recognized Indigenous self-\ndetermination \u2014 agency for tribes to decide for themselves if they want to\nengage in carbon market projects at all.\n\n\u201cFPIC without enablers of self determination is useless because what do you\ngive consent over when your land rights are not there? What do you give\nconsent of if you are not part of the decision governance arrangement?\u201d said\nRiamit, who is of the Maasai tribe in Kenya. Enablers of self-determination\ninclude protections for Indigenous land sovereignty and land tenure security.\n\nRiamit says that, in carbon market projects, free, prior, and informed consent\nhas become a strategic tool and a confusing exercise in disseminating\ninformation rather than a way of obtaining meaningful consent from tribes.\nThere must be a deliberate and full disclosure to tribes of what they are\nagreeing to when engaging in a carbon market project, and time for them to\ndigest the information, consult internally, provide feedback, and \u2014 critically\n\u2014 \u201cbe able to say no.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s notable to Riamit that carbon offset companies don\u2019t advocate strongly,\nif at all, for improved self-determination of the Indigenous communities they\nwork with.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t sharpen a knife to slaughter themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
