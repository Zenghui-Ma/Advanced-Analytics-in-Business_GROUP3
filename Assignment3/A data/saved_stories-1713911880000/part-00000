Can it recover?\n\nNews\n\nBy Ben Turner\n\npublished yesterday\n\nAntarctic sea ice has been disappearing over the last several summers. Now,\nclimate scientists are wondering whether it will ever come back.\n\nA small boat glides around patches of sea ice in the water off Deception\nIsland in Antarctica. Sea ice in the region grows from a minimum in summer to\na maximum in winter, but in the last several years, the sea ice extent has\nbeen shrinking in summer.

The South\nPole's midnight sun appears to hover in place, never dropping below the\nhorizon for weeks between November and January.\n\nBut the Antarctic\u2019s timelessness is an illusion. Only a decade ago, on summer\nnights across the coast, the sun would glide ever so slightly over the ocean,\ndusting its ice floes in golden light.\n\nYet today, much of this sea ice is nowhere in sight. And scientists are\nincreasingly alarmed that it may never come back.\n\n\"Antarctica feels very distant, but the sea ice there matters so much to all\nof us,\" Ella Gilbert, a polar climate scientist at the British Antarctic\nSurvey, told Live Science. \"It's a really vital part of our climate system.\"\n\nUntil recently, Antarctic sea ice fluctuated between relatively stable summer\nminimums and winter maximums. But after a record minimum in 2016, things began\nto shift. Two record lows soon followed, including the smallest minimum ever\nin February 2023 at just 737,000 square miles (1.91 million square\nkilometers).\n\nAs winter began in March of that year, scientists hoped the ice cover would\nrebound. But what happened instead astonished them: Antarctic ice experienced\nsix months of record lows. At winter's peak in July, the continent was missing\na chunk of ice bigger than Western Europe.\n\n\"We all thought that the minimum was as bad as it was going to get; it was\n2023, not 2070,\" Ariaan Purich, an Antarctic climate researcher at Monash\nUniversity in Australia, told Live Science. \"So when winter came, we were in\ndisbelief.\"\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nNow, in 2024, the sea ice extent has reached another near-record low: just\n766,400 square miles (1.985 million square km) on Feb. 20.\n\nRelated: '2023 just blew everything off the charts': Antarctic sea ice hits\ntroubling low for third consecutive year\n\nA profound \"regime shift\" has taken place in the Antarctic, and climate\nscientists are racing to understand what will come next.\n\n\"When you push any part of the climate system, it has ripple effects that are\nfelt all over the world \u2014 not necessarily immediately, but many years down the\nline,\" Gilbert said. \"So by pushing the system more and more and more, we're\nmaking those ripples bigger and bigger. And eventually, we're all going to\nfeel them.\"\n\n## The ocean's heartbeat\n\nWhen summer turns to winter in the Antarctic, sea ice expands from its minimum\nof around 1 million square miles (3 million square km) to 7 million square\nmiles (18 million square km), covering 4% of Earth's surface in irregular,\nporcelain-white tiles.\n\nMost of this sea ice grows in winter during the weeks-long polar night, upon\nareas of open water on the floating ice shelf that wraps around the continent.\nBuffeted by fierce winds from inland, the seawater holes, or polynyas, inside\nthe floating ice shelf freezes while being sprinkled with snow, building the\nsheet piece by piece.\n\nThe coastal ice mosaic serves a variety of purposes. First, this moat of sea\nice keeps warming seawater from the continent's increasingly precarious land\nice, protecting its hanging glaciers. The sea ice surface also reflects some\nof the sun's energy back into space in a process known as the albedo effect.\n\nIn the winter, Antarctica's sea ice cover expands dramatically from its\nminimum in summer, covering the ocean in irregular white tiles. These bright\nwhite tiles play a key role in regulating the Antarctic's ecosystem. (Image\ncredit: Patrick J. Endres via Getty Images)\n\nThese floating platforms also play a key role in the Antarctic ecosystem,\nproviding a habitat for creatures such as penguins and krill. Krill feast on\nphotosynthetic algae that grow around the platforms, and their poo locks away\ncarbon dioxide that then falls to the ocean floor.\n\nSea ice also helps to drive the conveyor belt of ocean circulation. As sea ice\nmelts, cold water cascading from the continental shelf drives the deep water\nfarther down and out, fueling a circumpolar stream that drives all of the\nworld's ocean currents. In fact, 40% of the global ocean traces its origins to\nthe Antarctic coastline, making it vital in regulating regional climates\nacross the planet.\n\nSeen this way, the rhythmic expansion and contraction of the ice sheet are\nlike a heartbeat, pushing nutrients, oxygen and heat around the world and\ndrawing carbon dioxide down into the deep ocean, where roughly 30% of carbon\nemissions are trapped for hundreds of years.\n\nFor most of recorded history, the ocean's \"heartbeat\" \u2014 and its impact on\ncarbon cycling and ocean circulation \u2014 was fairly steady. But then it skipped\na beat.\n\n## Off the charts\n\nEarth's sea ice is charted each year by the satellite record, which has\nmeasured sea ice fluctuations at both poles since 1979.\n\nThe Arctic's future has always been simple and bleak: a steady plunge in ice\ncoverage by more than 12% each decade.\n\nYet, at the opposite end of the planet, the Antarctic appeared to be beating\nthe odds. Until 2015, the Antarctic's ice extent didn't just hold fast \u2014 it\ngrew slightly and, in fact, hit an all-time high in 2014. This means that when\nthe precipitous fall came in 2016, scientists weren't sure if they were\nobserving a fluke event or an ominous, fundamental shift.\n\n\"It's possible that what's happened over the last seven years just might\ncontinue,\" Martin Siegert, a glaciologist who led an investigation of the\nAntarctic's dwindling sea ice, told Live Science.\n\nA key contributor to the Arctic's rapid melting is a process called surface\nalbedo feedback. When sea ice melts, it uncovers darker waters that absorb\nmore of the sun's rays. This vicious inversion of the albedo effect has\ntransformed the Arctic from a refrigerator to a radiator, and it now warms\nfour times faster than the rest of the world.\n\n\"If we start losing sea ice annually and the same process occurs in the\nAntarctic as it does in the Arctic, then the Antarctic will warm at an\naccelerated rate.\u201d It will be a disaster for the planet,\" Siegert said.\n\nBefore 2016, scientists held out faint hope that Antarctica's complex system\nwas temporarily stabilizing the global climate. Now, that hope has faded.\n\nThick sea ice fringing the continent of Antarctica. Climate scientists are\nworried that the lows in sea ice seen in the last several years may be the\nbeginning of a regime change that could have dramatic impacts on the climate.\n(Image credit: Raimondo Restelli / 500px via Getty Images)\n\nIn a September 2023 paper, Purich and her colleague Edward Doddridge found the\nfirst clue that the shift in the Antarctic sea ice system wasn't just a freak\nevent: In 2015, the Southern Ocean began warming at depths of 330 to 660 feet\n(100 to 200 meters), and has stayed warm ever since.\n\nRelated: 'Unprecedented,' 'Gobsmacked', 'Unbelievable': Changes in\nAntarctica's sea ice could have dramatic impacts, says climate scientist\nEdward Doddridge\n\nAs sea ice loss tends to occur in regions of high ocean warming, the latter\nhas changed the way the atmosphere and the ocean interact to form ice,\nshifting the Antarctic system into a new state. It was this change, Purich\nsaid, that caused last year's record low.\n\nAnd the new Antarctic is behaving differently. Before the apparent shift,\nthere was no connection between the sea ice found at the summer minimum and\nthat at the winter maximum. Now, the two are strongly linked.\n\n## What comes next\n\nThe immediate impacts of declining Antarctic sea ice are already here. For\nexample, the 2022 dip caused mass die-offs of thousands of emperor penguin\nchicks in Western Antarctica, with scientists expecting to find even more\ndeaths from 2023. Also in 2022, Eastern Antarctica experienced its biggest\nheat wave ever recorded, with temperatures climbing up to 72 F (40 C) above\nnormal.\n\nRelated: Hundreds of emperor penguin chicks spotted plunging off a 50-foot\ncliff in 1st-of-its-kind footage\n\nMoreover, the deep ocean currents surrounding Antarctica, which have already\nslowed by 30% since the 1990s, are predicted to slow by a further 40% by 2050.\n\nDespite the accelerated response caused by reverse albedo feedback, scientists\nare careful not to call the Antarctic sea ice decline an irreversible tipping\npoint.\n\n\"If it cooled down a bit, [sea ice] could freeze again,\" Purich said.\n\nHowever, she notes that the bigger worry is that a lack of sea ice could\ntrigger other, lasting tipping points across the region.\n\n\"In the absence of sea ice, the ocean swell can break apart ice shelves faster\nthan they otherwise would,\" Purich said. \"Once the shelves have broken away,\nthe land ice they're supporting can slide into the ocean.\"\n\nIf the West Antarctic Ice Sheet alone were to break up and melt into the sea,\nit would elevate global sea levels by approximately 11 feet (3.4 m).\n\nThe weakening of the Antarctic-driven ocean circulation could also hasten the\ncollapse of key ocean currents, such as the Atlantic meridional overturning\ncirculation (AMOC), which helps maintain temperate climates in the Northern\nHemisphere.\n\nRecently, worrying studies have pointed to a downturn in AMOC's strength. If\nthe ocean current were to weaken as much as it did during the last Ice Age,\nfor instance, temperatures in Europe and North America could drop by as much\nas 9 F (5 C) within a decade.\n\nThe timing and impacts of these secondary tipping points have become vital\nquestions. Yet despite agreement around the noticeable impact of climate\nchange, Antarctica's complexity, the dearth of historical data, and\ndifficulties obtaining funding to collect it make precise predictions\nchallenging.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014World's biggest iceberg 3 times the size of New York City is finally escaping\nAntarctica after being trapped for almost 40 years\n\n\u2014Collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is 'unavoidable,' study finds\n\n\u2014Antarctic sea ice reached 'record-smashing low' last month\n\n\"The Antarctic is difficult. It's hard to model; it's very hard to measure.\nIt's hard to even get there,\" Caroline Holmes, a polar researcher at the\nBritish Antarctic Survey, told Live Science. \"But there's a lot of research\nmomentum at the moment to say, look, we need to do more.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the obvious prescription for our ailing planetary systems\nstill applies: urgent and deep cuts to global CO2 emissions, Siegert said.\n\n\u201cThe only way forward is to decarbonize, and decarbonizing as soon as possible\nmeans we\u2019ll not see the worst possible outcomes.\u201d Siegert said.\n\nBen Turner\n\nStaff Writer\n\nBen Turner is a U.K. based staff writer at Live Science.

The clue is in the words \"above\nnormal\". The absolute temperature was about \u22129.4\u00b0C. The anomaly is reported to\nbe 30 to 40 delta-\u00b0 C. The Celsius scale goes as about 1.8 degrees change per\ndegree Fahrenheit. 40 * 1.8 = 72, so a 40\u00b0 C change in temperature is about\n72\u00b0F change.

When you're doing a relative temperature change you leave that out. 72F x\n5/9 = 40C. For example, lets say the temperature went up 72F from -40F (-40C).\nThe new temperature would be 32F. Using the previous formula, 32 = C x 1.8 +\n32. C = 0, which is a change of 40C from the previous temperature.\n\nReply\n\n  * Broadlands\n\n\"....and drawing carbon dioxide down into the deep ocean, where roughly 30% of\ncarbon emissions are trapped for hundreds of years.\" So... isn't that a good\nthing?
