Discord servers, YouTube channels, and Instawitches show\nthat magic is more popular than ever. We enjoy performances where skilled\nmagicians make lemons or elephants appear and disappear before our eyes. Not\nmany academic philosophers discuss magic, however, five centuries ago,\nprominent Renaissance philosophers, such as Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499),\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463\u20131494), and Giordano Bruno (1548\u20131600),\nwrote extensive treatises on the topic. They conceived of magic as the ability\nto work wonders, and as such it merited close philosophical attention.\n\nIn Wonderstruck, I treat magic (like science and religion) as a cognitive\ntechnology that harnesses our sense of wonder. Magic connects to wonder in two\nways. First, it is the ability to do wondrous things, and hence a kind of\npower. The word \u201cmagic\u201d derives ultimately from the Proto-Indo European word\nfor \u201cpower.\u201d Second, magic is passive: it denotes our amazement at wonders we\ndon\u2019t fully understand. The word thaumaturgy ultimately derives from the Greek\nroot thaumazein, which means to wonder. Magic relies on both these aspects:\nactive power and passive wonder.\n\nConsider a magic trick such as the cups and balls, which is cross-culturally\nwidespread and was already mentioned in a letter by Seneca. A ball seemingly\nvanishes from the magician\u2019s closed fist to reappear under a cup. This is\nrepeated until eventually, the magician makes a lemon or some other object\nappear (in lieu of a ball) under one of the cups. This trick relies on object\npermanence, our ability to track occluded objects. The magician uses\nmisdirection (demonstrating the cup is empty) to maneuver the ball under it.\nWe are also beguiled because we attribute intentionality to hand gestures. The\nsleight of hand used is the French drop, where an object is seemingly\ntransferred while remaining in its original position. At a neural level, there\nis a clear difference between surprise and wonder: a surprise action, such as\na hand swiping a coin away, elicits a different response from a magical\naction, where a coin disappears into thin air. Adam Smith already theorized\nabout this difference between surprise and wonder in his History of Astronomy\n(1795): we expect the ball to disappear and reappear in the cups and balls\nmagic trick; we are not surprised, but we \u201cwill still wonder, though\nforewarned of what we are to see.\u201d\n\nWhile it is tempting to focus on sleight of hand as the essential part of\nstage magic, magical performances are a more encompassing art that strive to\ncreate beauty and a compelling narrative. As stage magician and philosopher\nLarry Hass explains, witnessing magic can be empowering because as the\naudience you get to share in the idea that we can achieve the impossible.\nStage magician Teller describes magic as a kind of playful epistemology, \u201cthe\nheaviest philosophical ideas you can possibly have, dealt with in the silliest\nway.\u201d\n\nBut magic is more than diversion. In fact, historians, anthropologists, and\nphilosophers have speculated that magical practices lie at the origin of\nscience. Consider a philosopher such as Giordano Bruno. According to Frances\nYates\u2019s classic monograph Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (1964), he\nwas not burned at the stake for his acceptance of heliocentrism but because he\ndabbled in hermetic magic. For Bruno, there was no clear dividing line between\nearly science and magic. Consider his definition of natural magic from his On\nmagic (1584):\n\n> Magic refers to what happens as a result of the powers of attraction and\n> repulsion between things, for example, the pushes, motions and attractions\n> due to magnets and such things, when all these actions are due not to active\n> and passive qualities but rather to the spirit or soul existing in things.\n> This is called \u201cnatural magic\u201d in the proper sense.\n\nAccording to Bruno, magicians, alchemists, and other dabblers directly\nmanipulate natural materials and observe the effects of their manipulations.\nLike many other Renaissance magicians, Bruno saw magic as entirely natural:\nphenomena such as magnetism and electricity were bizarre but not of\nsupernatural origin. By contrast, natural philosophers tried to airbrush\nstrange phenomena away. The origin of science, accordingly, lies in\nrecognizing that strange phenomena are natural and that we can gain control\nover them.\n\nIn addition to Yates, philosophers such as Neurath saw magic as a precursor to\nscience. Otto Neurath (1882\u20131945) is now best known as one of the co-founders\nof the Vienna Circle (Wiener Kreis) in 1924, and of the associated\nphilosophical movement known as logical positivism. His philosophy of science\nis intimately related to his cosmopolitan, progressive political ideas.\nNeurath wanted to present an ideological alternative to the fascism which was\ngrowing in his home country Austria in the 1920s. To stop the far right, he\nargued that we should aim for clarity of thought, practicality, and improving\nthe lives of people who were hard-hit by the financial crisis of the 1920s. In\ntheir 1929 Vienna Circle manifesto, he, together with Hans Hahn and Rudolph\nCarnap insisted that \u201cthe scientific world-conception knows no unsolvable\nriddle.\u201d Their vision of science was connected to their concern with\ncollective human life, including improving the lives of the working class,\npublic education, and social reform. They presented magic as the intellectual\nancestor of science: we should be \u201creturning, after a metaphysical interlude,\nto a unified picture of this world which had, in a sense, been at the basis of\nmagical beliefs, free from theology, in the earliest times.\u201d\n\nNeurath believed that magic as a human practice is rooted in the same\ncommonsensical, practical thinking that motivates modern science. Science is\nnot elitist, but the opposite: it is a range of practices that people use to\nhelp improve their lives. He saw working-class people as resembling Indigenous\npeople, striving to solve concrete problems that their natural and social\nenvironments pose. As he explains in Empirical sociology (1931) magicians,\nlike scientists, try to find causal connections in opaque phenomena:\n\n> What we have of systematic and orderly action and speech thus seems to go\n> back to primeval systematic orderliness as found in magic. The scientific\n> tendency to link everything with everything else, to regard nothing as\n> indifferent, clearly already belonged to the age of magic.\n\nUnfortunately, the Vienna Circle was forced to stop its activities in a\ngrowing climate of fascism and eventually the murder of one of its members\n(Moritz Schlick). But Neurath points out an important aspect of magic: magic\nshows our ambition to deal with the wondrous and not shy away from it, to find\nconnections in a causally opaque universe, and to come up with practical\nsolutions based on those connections.\n\nMagic shows how wonder and power are in a dynamic relationship: we are\nconfronted with wonders we can\u2019t explain, but we try our best to figure them\nout. When you watch a magic show, you can\u2019t but help wonder at the secrets\nbehind each sleight of hand, and a big subgenre of magical performance\nconsists of revealing how classic tricks are accomplished. Wonder is thus not\nthe endpoint of knowledge, but a starting point. As Adam Smith puts it, \u201cWho\nwonders at the machinery of the opera-house who has once been admitted behind\nthe scenes? In the wonders of nature, however, it rarely happens that we can\ndiscover so clearly this connecting chain.\u201d Thus, wonder prompts us to\ncontinue to look for hidden connections and to try to untangle how things are\ndone.\n\nHelen De Cruz is the Danforth Chair in the Humanities and professor of\nphilosophy at Saint Louis University.
