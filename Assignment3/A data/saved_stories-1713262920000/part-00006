The company had\nexperimented with charging a $1 annual subscription fee for users in the\nPhilippines and New Zealand to be able to post and interact with other users\non X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cNot-a-Bot\u201d terms and conditions page was included in the changes flagged\nby the automated account. The new policy states that new accounts must pay a\n\u201csmall annual fee\u201d before being able to post, like, bookmark, or reply to\nother tweets. However, new accounts will be able to follow other accounts and\nbrowse the platform for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA representative for X did not immediately return Quartz\u2019s request for\ncomment.\n\nThe new policy comes as X faces backlash over its inability to stop the flood\nof spam accounts that link to pornographic content and fake products. Earlier\nthis month, Musk kicked off a \u201csystem purge\u201d of bot and troll accounts on the\nplatform, although it\u2019s unclear how successful the effort was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nX has failed to limit bots before, despite Musk\u2019s declaration that \u201cwe will\ndefeat the spam bots or die trying\u201d before he bought Twitter for $44 billion\nin 2022.\n\nThe new fee is also likely a push by X to make some cash as the company\ncontinues to lose value. The social media giant has shed at least 71% of its\nvalue since Musk acquired it, according to mutual fund giant Fidelity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDozens of advertisers\u2014including Comcast, Apple, and The Walt Disney\nCompany\u2014pulled their spending on X last November after reports that their\ncompanies\u2019 ads were appearing next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech. The\ncompany lost $1.5 billion in ad revenue in 2023 because of the onslaught of\ndepartures. Musk later told advertisers to \u201cgo f[*]ck [themselves]\u201d during an\ninterview with the New York Times.\n\nDoubleVerify, which provides brand-safety measurement ratings for digital\nplatforms to major advertisers, apologized last week for incorrectly\ndisplaying X\u2019s Brand Safety Rate for nearly five months. The rating measures\nhow frequently ads appear beside content that met advertiser-approved metrics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Oct. 24, 2023, to March 14, DoubleVerify\u2019s dashboard provided incorrect\ndata. In some cases, the firm showed scores as low as 70%. However, X\u2019s actual\nrates were 99.99%, according to DoubleVerify.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
