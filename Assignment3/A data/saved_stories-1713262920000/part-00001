I always enjoy reading other people\u2019s discussions of their writing\nprocess, so I thought it would be worthwhile to explain mine.\n\nFirst, some background. In school I was a competent but unspectacular writer\n(my verbal SAT score was a full 100 points lower than my math score). Like\nmost millennials, I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life in a sea of text (reading\nonline, writing emails, instant messages, gaming chats, and so on), but\n\u201cserious\u201d writing has never been particularly compelling to me, and major\nwriting projects always took a lot of willpower to do. Prior to Construction\nPhysics, I had done very little writing in my adult life: I spent most of my\ncareer as an engineer, which required little to no writing, and while every so\noften I would start a blog or write a forum post, I never maintained it as a\nhabit. I\u2019m not like Scott Alexander or Freddie deBoer, writers who can crank\nout huge amounts of high-quality text like it's a bodily function. Writing\ndoes not come particularly naturally to me, and my process reflects that.\n\nThere are, broadly, two types of posts I write (with significant overlap). The\nfirst are explanation-driven posts, where I try to explain some given topic.\nMore often than not, the impetus is to explain something to myself: I feel\nlike I don\u2019t understand a topic, and use writing as a way to work through an\nunderstanding of it. I started Construction Physics as a project to try and\nunderstand why construction productivity never seemed to increase, and though\nits scope has expanded to include infrastructure and industrial technology,\nlearning how something works is still a major driver. A deficiency that I\u2019ve\nturned into an advantage is that I get confused easily, and need a very clear,\nstep-by-step explanation of something before I understand it. This often\nresults in a written explanation that other people find useful. \u201cHow the Gas\nTurbine Conquered the Electric Power Industry\u201d and \u201cWhat Happened to the US\nMachine Tool Industry?\u201d are recent examples of this sort of post.\n\nIn some explanatory posts, the impetus for writing is that while I understand\nsomething, I get the impression that most other people don\u2019t. \u201cOn Klein on\nConstruction,\" \u201cOn Yglesias on Manufactured Homes,\" and \u201cHow Valuable are\nBuilding Methods that use Fewer Materials\u201d are examples. But even these posts\ngenerally require me to research a topic further before I can write about it.\nFor \u201cOn Yglesias on Manufactured Homes,\" for instance, I needed to better\nunderstand things such as how much manufactured home mortgage lending occurs\nand the rules for treating manufactured homes as property.\n\nThe second type of post I write is exploratory, rather than explanatory. I\nfind some dataset or collection of information that I think will be\ninteresting to explore, and I write up what I find while exploring it. \u201cWhen\nDid New York Start Building Slowly?\u201d and \u201cThe Worst US Bridges are Getting\nFixed\u201d are examples of this type of post. I started with a dataset (the\nNational Bridge Inventory and the CTBUH\u2019s skyscraper database, respectively)\nand just poked around to see if there was anything interesting to find.\n\nThese categories will often overlap: I\u2019ll be interested in understanding\nsomething, and do so by exploring some dataset (or multiple datasets). The\n\u201cDoes Construction Ever Get Cheaper\u201d post is an example of this, where I\nstarted with the question and was able to work my way towards an answer by\nfinding several good historical construction cost indexes.\n\n####\n\nStep 1: Research\n\nPosts often require quite a bit of research and reading to do. As time has\ngone on and I\u2019ve increasingly moved into topics that I don\u2019t have a background\nin, the research burden has risen. Ideally, if I\u2019ve chosen a narrow enough\ntopic, I can simply read everything of relevance ever written about it. This\nmight seem impossible to do in a short amount of time, but surprisingly little\ngets written about a lot of the topics I\u2019m interested in, and it's often more\nfeasible than you might think. Some of my best posts, such as the story of\ntitanium, the history of mobile homes, and building the Empire State Building\nwere ones where I was able to read or skim essentially every major text on the\ntopic. In cases where I can\u2019t read every major source, I try to get to the\npoint where I\u2019m hitting diminishing returns and each new source just covers\nmaterial that I\u2019ve already read elsewhere.\n\nSources used for the gas turbine post. I was not able to read everything ever\nwritten about this topic.\n\nThe sorts of sources I use vary. In some cases, there will be a major work or\ntwo (a book, or a PhD dissertation) that covers the topic very thoroughly, and\nI can just read those and a small number of supplementary sources. The \u201cWhy\nDid We Wait So Long For Wind Power\u201d series is an example of this type of post:\nthe lion\u2019s share of the information came from a single book. (If a source is\ndefinitive and interesting, I\u2019ll sometimes turn it into a book review post.)\nBut more often than not I need to piece together an explanation from many\nseparate sources. The gas turbine post and the Rise of Steel posts required\nlots of individual sources. Sometimes I\u2019ll misjudge the \u201csize\u201d of an\nexplanation and find myself faced with an enormous literature that I struggle\nto pare down. The Birth of the Grid series is an example of this (often a\nmultipart post is an indication that I\u2019ve misjudged the scope of my topic and\nhave gotten myself into trouble). The ideal topic is one where the existing\nliterature is extensive enough that there\u2019s value in synthesizing it, but not\nso extensive that I can\u2019t read all or most of it in a short amount of time.\n\nThere\u2019s no particular magic to the research process. Just lots and lots of\nsearching on Google/Google Scholar/Google Books for relevant topics, keywords\nand questions until I feel like I\u2019ve cracked open the literature and found the\nmajor relevant works. I\u2019ll often do a lot of searching before doing much\nactual reading, by opening up dozens of new tabs for anything that looks like\nit might be relevant and sifting through them (and then doing more searches as\nI find new relevant considerations, new keywords and search terms, or am\npointed to new sources that I haven\u2019t yet seen).\n\nI can usually tell once I\u2019ve \u201cbroken in\u201d to the literature and found most of\nthe relevant references, and I will keep hammering on searches until I do.\nWhile I don\u2019t have much natural inclination towards writing, I do have one for\ninternet research, and it takes little willpower for me to research a topic as\ndeep as I feel like I need to go. Despite the internet being ubiquitous for\ndecades, very few people have internalized that they truly have access to all\nthe information in the world, and that if an answer to a question exists, its\navailable somewhere on the internet if you're willing to look hard enough:\neither it\u2019s on some electronic document, or in a book that modern e-commerce\nhas made trivial to acquire, or in the mind of an expert whose email you can\nprobably find. I will keep pushing on a topic until I feel like I've exhausted\nmy options, and it's rare that I learn about a potentially useful book or\nreference and am not able to get it.\n\nFor access to sources, I have an alumni login for my college library, which\nallows me to access most academic papers, dissertations and the like. If that\ndoesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll turn to Sci-Hub, Libgen, Internet Archive and the like. I\nlike having physical copies of books (and often I\u2019ll want some book that's out\nof print), so I also buy a lot of books on Amazon. Early on I would hem and\nhaw about purchasing a book for a post, but now I basically buy any book I\nthink might be useful, which amounts to several hundred books per year.\n\n####\n\nStep 2: Reading and thinking\n\nAt the end of the research process, I end up with a big pile of relevant\nsources. I do not read particularly fast, but I am very good at skimming: I\ncan hunt through a large text quickly, ignore most of the information that\u2019s\nnot relevant to my purposes, and hone in on the important bits. And because I\noften revisit topics (or use one post as a springboard into further, similar\nposts) I often find that sources cover material I'm already familiar with and\ncan skip. With the US Steel post, for instance, I was already very familiar\nwith the steel industry because of my previous posts on the topic, which made\nresearching easier.\n\nAs I\u2019m reading, I\u2019m highlighting anything that is relevant to the topic, or\nthat just seems interesting. Sometimes I will copy and paste these bits into a\nbig scratch document, but often I\u2019ll just mentally keep track of what the\ninteresting bits are and what document they\u2019re in. As I\u2019m doing this, I\u2019m also\ngenerating thoughts and ideas in response to what I\u2019m reading: relationships\nto things I\u2019ve read elsewhere or written about previously, organizing concepts\nthat some detail is an example of, themes I see repeated, and so on. Like the\nhighlights, sometimes I\u2019ll put these down into the scratch document, but just\nas often I simply keep track of them in my head. I tend to get some of my best\nideas at night right before bed (I find being tired makes the associations\ncome a little more freely), which I write down by sending myself an email from\nmy phone. I\u2019m something of a slow thinker, so it often takes a few days of the\nresearch marinating in my head before I have any interesting ideas about it\n(one reason it takes me about a week to write a post).\n\nIf I\u2019m writing about a topic that I don't have much direct experience with,\nI'll sometimes supplement reading with a discussion with an expert or experts,\nwho can redirect me if I'm off-track or point me to useful literature and\nproper keywords. These folks are also often gracious enough to read through a\ndraft of a post and point out any mistakes I might have made.\n\n####\n\nStep 3: Compression and structure\n\nAfter I\u2019ve read through the various sources on a topic, I have a collection of\nfacts and details I think are interesting and relevant, and a collection of\nthoughts and ideas that the reading has inspired, either in a scratchpad\ndocument or just in my head. The next step in the process is to compress this\nmass of facts, details and ideas, by finding a simple structure that\nsummarizes and explains it. This may be a concise history of the topic\ncovering the bits that I think are relevant, it may be a simple explanation of\nthe patterns in the data, and so on. Here I find it helpful to imagine a\nconversation: I\u2019ve just read an enormous amount on a topic (or made an\nenormous number of graphs, if it's a data-driven, exploratory post). How would\nI explain the basic ideas in what I\u2019ve read to an intelligent non-expert? The\nfact that I get easily confused is once again beneficial here \u2013 it\u2019s very\nobvious to me if some explanation doesn\u2019t make sense or feels incomplete.\n\nThis typically results in a short document, around 800 words in length, that\nlays out the basic structure of the post, but doesn\u2019t include much if any\ndetail. I put a lot of emphasis on getting this structure correct: with the\nright structure, everything else will fall into place nicely (and a good\nstructure will make ideas clear even if the prose isn\u2019t especially strong).\nBut no amount of writing talent or finely crafted prose can rescue a bad\nstructure.\n\n####\n\nStep 4: Draft\n\nOnce I have the structure, I\u2019ll then flesh it out into a full draft, adding\nspecific details and examples, turning placeholder explanations into full\nexplanations, and so on. This takes the 800 word structure and turns it into a\n2500-4500-word (on average) first draft. If my topic is too large for a single\npost, it becomes obvious at this stage, and I think about where it makes sense\nto split it into multiple posts. At this stage I am NOT trying to make the\nprose sound good, I am not thinking about phrasing, or word choice, or\nanything that\u2019s typically associated with \u201cgood writing.\" I\u2019m ONLY trying to\nget all the relevant ideas and details onto the page, in the right order. I\ntry to make sure that any given idea is backed up with specific examples and\nevidence; flitting from idea to idea and building up long chains of reasoning\nwithout bothering to support them with examples and evidence along the way is\na good way to be completely full of shit.\n\nHere again, I\u2019ll make use of a fictional conversation with an intelligent non-\nexpert: if I was explaining this particular aspect of the idea to someone, how\nwould I support my point in a convincing way? What would I say, and what order\nwould I say it? In general I find \"If you were going to explain this to\nsomeone standing in front of you, what would you say? Ok, write that.\" a very\nuseful writing algorithm, both because it makes it easy to decide what to say,\nand it makes it clear whether an explanation is good or not.\n\nAt this stage, whether I\u2019ve done a good job capturing the essence of a topic\nwith the structure I created in step 3 will become obvious. A good structure\nis a strong structure that can support the \u201cweight\u201d of lots and lots of\nrelevant detail. Any fact that feels germane should have an obvious place to\nslot in, and adding a new detail shouldn\u2019t disrupt anything that\u2019s already\nthere. If the structure is correct, there won\u2019t be an issue if I find a new\nsource with new information late in the process. If I find myself finding\nfacts, details, and ideas that don\u2019t \u201cfit,\" it\u2019s an indicator that there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with the basic structure and I need to rework it. This doesn\u2019t\nhappen especially often now, but is something I struggled with early on.\n\n####\n\nStep 5: Editing and posting\n\nOnce the draft is written, I go back through and edit it. This is when I try\nand make things \u201csound good\u201d: cleaning up phrasing, tweaking word choice,\nrearranging sentences and paragraph structure, and so on. Ideally I would do\nmultiple editing passes, but often I only have time for one. Once I've done my\nedits, it goes to the IFP editor for a second round of editing, and then gets\nposted to Substack. I don\u2019t have a buffer of posts, so when they're done is\nwhen they go out.\n\n####\n\nTools and miscellanea\n\nThe tools I use are not especially interesting. Most of my work is done in a\nweb browser. I use Microsoft Edge, because it allows me to stack tabs\nvertically, and organize them into groups (last time I looked other browsers\ndidn't have this option, but Safari maybe does now?) I only mention browser\nchoice at all because I regard vertical, grouped tabs as absolutely critical\nfor getting any serious work done. I typically have 100+ tabs open at any\ngiven time, a few dozen for each topic in the research stage, and the only\nreason it's not more is because eventually my computer runs out of memory and\ncan\u2019t open any more PDFs. It feels like there should be a way of working\neffectively that doesn\u2019t require so many open tabs, but I find it very useful\nto have every reference open in front of me so I can quickly jump between\nthem.\n\nSome of the tabs I currently open for a topic I\u2019m researching\n\nI use Zotero for a reference manager - every important reference gets added to\nmy Zotero library, and each topic I write about gets its own tag. This isn\u2019t\nespecially useful for writing the post itself (since I basically just keep\nevery source open in its own browser tab until the post is done) but it's very\nuseful if I revisit a topic. I spent a long time resisting Zotero because I\ndon\u2019t like the way it stores PDFs, but I can\u2019t imagine not using it now.\n\nFor note-taking and scratchpad work I use Obsidian. I\u2019ve tried quite a few\ndifferent tools for this (Evernote, Roam, Notion, Onenote, even text editors\nlike Notepad++), and have landed on Obsidian because it has the basic\nfunctionality I want: snappy performance, can handle text and images, can\nquickly and easily navigate between different documents, decent search, and\n(most importantly) it isn\u2019t a piece of shit. Each post gets its own scratch\ndocument in Obsidian, which I use to hold any facts and thoughts I feel need\nkeeping track of. I also use Obsidian to write the first short structure\ndocument. I don\u2019t use any of Obsidian\u2019s cross-tagging or \u201ctools for thought\u201d\nfeatures (and I suspect that most people who invest a lot in using them are\nsort of wasting their time).\n\nFor writing the draft, I use google docs. I\u2019ve tried a few other word\nprocessors (such as Scrivener) but found them worse than google docs for\ninternet writing. With internet writing it's very useful to write in a browser\nso I can easily move images around; if I want to put images into a document\nand then paste the whole thing into the Substack editor, it\u2019s very easy if the\nwriting is already in the browser, but very hard if I\u2019m writing offline in\nsomething like Scrivener or Word. For data analysis, I almost always just use\nExcel (even for things I probably shouldn\u2019t), though I'm now making occasional\nuse of ChatGPT + Python for tasks where Excel would struggle.\n\nI will sometimes use ChatGPT for research, but not often. If I need to learn\nthe basics of some well-understood topic, ChatGPT is sometimes helpful, but\noften it has a hard time. For instance, on the gas turbine post, I needed to\nlearn the basic physics of how various engine cycles worked. ChatGPT was\nhelpful for this, but it still struggled with many of the questions I wanted\nanswered (it had a very hard time giving a good explanation of the\nrelationship between compression ratio and compressor efficiency, for\ninstance). And for more complex topics where there's not an already-existing,\ncorrect answer, it does even worse. It's not useless, but right now it doesn't\nseem appreciably better than just basic search.\n\nI have not found ChatGPT to be especially useful for pointing me towards\nuseful references. For a while I was trying Elicit as a literature search\ntool, but it was never especially useful for the sorts of things I research\n(it seems much more medicine and biology focused), and it has steadily gotten\nworse as they\u2019ve commercialized it.\n\nThis writing process is not particularly fast. A good writing day is one where\nI produce around 2000 words, though I\u2019m generally happy with anything over\n1500. I can generally write (or do writing-like tasks such as editing) for\nabout 4 hours a day; empirically, words produced after that inevitably end up\ngetting tossed out and aren\u2019t useful. There are sort of conflicting trends at\nwork here - over time I\u2019ve gotten better at squeezing out more words in a day,\nbut I\u2019ve also increasingly been writing about topics outside my experience and\nexpertise, which slows me down (since it requires consulting sources as I go\nalong). So the 2000 words a day level has remained roughly constant. This\nmeans a long post might take 4-6 days to write and edit, not including the\ntime spent researching.\n\nI used to struggle with working on more than one writing project at a time - a\nsingle topic would occupy my thoughts to such an extent that there wasn\u2019t room\nfor anything else. Over time I\u2019ve gotten better at this (partially because\nswitching to vertical, grouped tabs reduced the mental overhead of keeping\ntrack of sources), and I can now have several different ideas simmering\nsimultaneously. But it's still best if I can sort of \"live\" in a topic for a\nwhile and let it completely occupy my thoughts before I write a post on it.\nOnce the draft is done, the topic often seeps out of my head as I turn my\nattention to a new one. I\u2019ll sometimes disappoint people who ask me about a\ntopic I wrote about many months ago and discover that my knowledge of it isn\u2019t\nencyclopedic.\n\n####\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is the process I use to write every post on this Substack (as well as any\noutside writing I do). I would not necessarily recommend it to anyone else - I\nthink of it mostly as an algorithm for mechanically generating a steady stream\nof writing that takes maximum advantage of my strengths (such as internet\nresearch) and minimizes the amount of actual \u201cwriting\u201d required. At every\nstep, I have the luxury of ignoring almost all aspects of the writing process:\nwhile I\u2019m writing the structure I don\u2019t need to think about details or prose,\nwhile I\u2019m writing the draft I don\u2019t need to think about structure, word\nchoice, or phrasing, while I\u2019m editing I don\u2019t need to think about anything\nexcept phrasing and clarity, etc. Different people with different strengths\nmight be better served by a very different process. But for me, it seems to\nwork well.\n\n### Subscribe to Construction Physics\n\nBy Brian Potter \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nEssays about buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology.\n\n114\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How I Write Posts\n\nwww.construction-physics.com\n\n22\n\nShare\n\n22 Comments\n\nMCLFeb 19Thanks Brian!
