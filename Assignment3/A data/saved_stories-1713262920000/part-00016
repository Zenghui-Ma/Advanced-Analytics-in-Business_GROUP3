FinalWire Ltd., makers of AIDA64, confirmed to Der8auer\nthat Lamptron is bundling free invalid AIDA64 keys with its products and has\nbeen doing so for some time. FinalWire has requested that Lamptron stop this\nshady practice, but it has not. Der8auer suspects that Lamptron is using some\nsort of key generator to generate fake AIDA64 keys that will validate, but\nonly on select versions of the software.\n\nThe German overclocker first discovered Lamptron's shady tactics through one\nof his employees who heard about Lamptron AIDA64 product keys not working on a\nforum two years ago. Deciding to see if this was true or not, Der8auer pulled\nout a \"free\" AIDA64 key from his Lampton ST060 air cooler to see if it would\nwork.\n\nHe found that the key works as advertised. The box says the AIDA64 key is a\n\"free version and does not support online upgrades.\" Plugging the key into\nAIDA64 activates the product without any issues. However, updating AIDA64\ncaused the key to become invalid (just as the box info says).\n\nAfter contacting FinalWire, the AIDA64 makers confirmed that Lampton's \"free\"\nAIDA64 keys are invalid and illegal. It reports that Lampton registered as a\nreseller two years ago but only placed a single order for AIDA64 Extreme.\nFinalWire finally reveals that it is unclear if Lampton ever bundled valid\nlicenses with its devices.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\n\"We understand your concerns regarding the \"FREE VERSION\" license included\nwith the cooler. Unfortunately, we've discovered instances of Lampton bundling\ninvalid AIDA64 licenses with their products. When we became aware of this, we\nimmediately contacted Lamptron and requested they cease this practice.\nAlthough they registered as a reseller two years ago and placed a single order\nfor AIDA64 Extreme, it's unclear if they ever bundled valid licenses with\ntheir devices.\"\n\nDer8auer tested several other Lampton AIDA64 keys from several other products\nand discovered that all of them were invalid. Some of them were labeled as\ndifferent versions as well, including AIDA64 Extreme and AIDA64 Business, even\nthough Lampton only officially bought AIDA64 Extreme at one time.\n\nLampton is using its free AIDA64 keys to power its LCD displays. The company's\ndisplays don't have any software included and thus requires 3rd party software\nto operate. AIDA64 has a feature that allows users to make their own OSD\nspecifically for secondary hardware monitoring displays.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

But if it continues to provide these keys against FinalWire's\nwishes, the company is obviously at continuous risk of serious consequences.\n\nAaron Klotz\n\nFreelance News Writer\n\nAaron Klotz is a freelance writer for Tom\u2019s Hardware US, covering news topics\nrelated to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.\n\nSee more Cooling News\n\nMore about cooling\n\nBest AIO Coolers 2024\n\nBest CPU Coolers 2024: AIO and Air Coolers\n\nLatest\n\nRaspberry Pi brings GitHub's Octocat to life, with tentacles that wiggle\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\n4 Comments Comment from the forums\n\n  * peachpuff\n\nChinese company?\n\nReply\n\n  * thestryker\n\n> peachpuff said:\n>\n> Chinese company?\n\nChinese company who bought a Western company's name!
