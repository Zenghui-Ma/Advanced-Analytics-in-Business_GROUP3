Use that code format for logs, code, config, etc. Keep each type\nof sample separate, or at least spaced out well enough, with a comment to show\nwhat it is.\n\n### Example\n\n    \n    \n    # dmesg log with error [331337.438088] hub 4-0:1.0: 2 ports detected [331337.465300] ACPI: bus type thunderbolt registered [331337.612428] thunderbolt 0000:08:00.0: 0: DROM device_rom_revision 0x0 unknown [331337.613424] thunderbolt 0-0: ignoring unnecessary extra entries in DROM [331342.334285] ieee80211 phy0: brcmf_inetaddr_changed: fail to get arp ip table err:-52 [331357.956017] xhci_hcd 0000:3e:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3cold to D0, device inaccessible [331357.956034] xhci_hcd 0000:3e:00.0: Controller not ready at resume -19 [331357.956035] xhci_hcd 0000:3e:00.0: PCI post-resume error -19! [331357.956037] xhci_hcd 0000:3e:00.0: HC died; cleaning up # partial results from lspci 00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 100 Series/C230 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #1 (rev f1) 00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 100 Series/C230 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #2 (rev f1)\n\n## Reproducible Issue\n\nWhere possible create a minimal reproduction of the issue. This lets people\ntry recreate the issue with your config and prevents you from leaking secrets\nthat might need to stay secret.\n\nUnless you are certain the problem exists in just one file, make people's\nlives easier by giving as much info as possible.\n\nThe best way to do that is a cut down, reproducible sample.\n\n## Explain Environment\n\nExplain the environment you are running in, it may well be an environmental\nissue you are facing. Things like what hardware, software and config (where\nyou can) it's running - i.e. Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfcd85 on a\nlaptop running Debian 11.7 stable, an AWS VM `m7g.large` running Amazon Linux,\netc.\n\n## Make it Quick & Easy for People\n\nBe conscious of the amount of time people have to spend to get up to speed.\nThis ties in with the reproducible sample. Don't post a link to an instruction\nyou followed. If you do that and nothing else you are expecting people to read\nthrough that article which takes precious time. Even after reading it, unless\nthere is an obvious mistake in the article, it may not assist you as chances\nare you've done something different to the article. Maybe you missed a step,\nmaybe you made a typo, used different hosting options, used different versions\nof software. Feel free to add that you followed an article, but don't expect\npeople helping you to have to read that article before getting started.\n\n## Explain Your Steps so Far\n\nState what you have tried and what you think it might be, there is nothing\nless rewarding than helping someone who's tried nothing for themselves and\ngiven up.\n\n## Provide Useful Information\n\nIf someone is helping you, please reply with more than just \"that doesn't\nwork\". Show how you followed their advice and what the result was. If you\naren't paying in cash for the help, pay in effort, show people you've done as\nthey asked and the exact result of what happened.\n\n## Make Single Changes\n\nChange one thing at a time. If more than one person responds, don't apply more\nthan one suggestion at a time. You need to see what each change does. The\nexception is when you are explicitly told to apply more than one fix as they\ncan see you have more than one issue. Even then though, it's just good\npractice to make a single change and see what it does.\n\n  * Help & Support\n\n0 comments\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nP4X-639 Ltd Trading as Rawkode Academy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\u00a9 Rawkode Academy, 2023\n\nbottom of page\n\n", "frontpage": false}
