They suggested\nthe 787's carbon-composite skin is nearly impervious to metal fatigue that\nweakens conventional aluminum fuselages.\n\nRelated Story: Another Boeing whistleblower says he faced retaliation for\nreporting 'shortcuts'\n\nRelated Story: A Boeing whistleblower raises fresh concerns about the 787, and\nthe FAA investigates\n\nTheir comments during a lengthy media briefing served as both a response to\nnews reports last week about the whistleblower's allegations and a preemptive\nstrike before he testifies to a congressional panel on Wednesday.\n\nThe whistleblower, Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, said excessive force was\napplied to fit panels together on the 787 assembly line, raising the risk of\nfatigue, or microscopic cracking in the material that could cause it break\napart.\n\nThe Boeing officials described how sections of a fuselage are brought\ntogether, shims are added to fill gaps, holes are drilled and cleaned, and\nfasteners attached to apply \"pull-up force\" that 99% of the time results in\nmargins no greater than .005 inches (0.127 millimeters) apart \u2014 the width of a\nhuman hair, they said. A gap problem was discovered in 2019 between two\npanels, which led to design and assembly changes, they said.\n\nBoeing conducted testing replicating 165,000 flights with no findings of\nfatigue in the composite structure, Steve Chisholm, Boeing's vice president of\nstructural engineering, said. The average 787 makes 600 flights a year, he\nsaid.\n\nThe company said planes already in use are proving safe. Chisholm said 671\nDreamliners have undergone the intensive inspections for 6-year-old planes and\neight have undergone 12-year inspections with no evidence of fatigue in the\ncomposite skins.\n\nCracks have been found on metallic parts, including a piece above where the\nwings join the fuselage, and Boeing issued inspection guidelines for those\nparts, the officials said.\n\nThe 787 Dreamliner is a two-aisle plane that has often been used on\ninternational flights since its debut in 2011. The composite material makes\nthe plane lighter, contributing to better fuel efficiency.\n\nA series of battery fires briefly grounded the planes. Deliveries of the\naircraft have been stopped at times because of questions about gaps between\nfuselage panels that were wider than Boeing's standards allowed, the use of\nunapproved titanium parts from a supplier in Italy, and flaws in a pressure\nbulkhead.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration must inspect and approve each 787 that\nrolls off the assembly line before it can be flown to an airline customer.\n\nRelated Story: How bad is Boeing's 2024 so far? Here's a timeline\n\nThe whistleblower Salehpour claims that after he raised safety concerns about\nthe 787, Boeing transferred him to work on an older widebody plane, the 777.\nHe told the Seattle Times that he saw workers jumping on fuselage panels to\nget them in alignment, which Boeing disputes.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the FAA is investigating Salehpour's claims.\nThe FAA, while not commenting specifically on Salehpour, said it investigates\nall safety reports.\n\nBoeing says it is \"fully confident\" in both planes.\n\nSalehpour is the latest in a line of Boeing whistleblowers to come forward,\noften alleging retaliation for raising safety concerns. The company said it\nencourages employees to speak up about problems.\n\nLisa Fahl, the vice president of engineering for Boeing airplane programs,\nsaid employee reports have \"exploded\" \u2014 with as many reports in January and\nFebruary as were filed in all of 2023 \u2014 \"which is what we want.\"\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
