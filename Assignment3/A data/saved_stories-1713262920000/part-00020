Some scholars predicted that national\ncultures would converge by adopting social values typical of Western\ndemocracies. Others predicted that cultural differences in values would\npersist or even increase over time. We test these competing predictions by\nanalyzing survey data from 1981 to 2022 (n = 406,185) from 76 national\ncultures. We find evidence of global value divergence. Values emphasizing\ntolerance and self-expression have diverged most sharply, especially between\nhigh-income Western countries and the rest of the world. We also find that\ncountries with similar per-capita GDP levels have held similar values over the\nlast 40 years. Over time, however, geographic proximity has emerged as an\nincreasingly strong correlate of value similarity, indicating that values have\ndiverged globally but converged regionally.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Increase in concerns about climate change following climate strikes and\ncivil disobedience in Germany\n\nArticle Open access 04 April 2024\n\nJohannes Brehm & Henri Gruhl\n\n### The process and mechanisms of personality change\n\nArticle 15 March 2024\n\nJoshua J.

Different national cultures place different degrees of emphasis\non the collective vs. the individual^1, openness vs. obedience^2,3, and faith\nvs. skepticism^4. Understanding this variation has become a central goal in\nthe scientific study of culture, since social values shape international\nconflict, economic climate, and law. Studies seek to identify historical\norigins of cultural differences in values^5,6,7 and estimate how values have\nchanged across cultures in modern history^8,9. A fundamental question for this\nresearch is whether social values are converging or diverging across cultures.\nGlobalization and imperialism have homogenized many forms of culture,\nincluding language^10 and religion^11. Have values also converged across\ncultures in recent history, or have they remained an area of persistent or\neven increasing cultural divergence?\n\nTraditional modernization theories famously predicted a convergence in social\nvalues. Inspired by the philosophies of Marx and Hegel, modernization\ntheorists suggested that the end of the Cold War and the rise of globalization\nwould catalyze the worldwide spread of a \u201cuniversal civilization\u201d with liberal\nand individualizing values that emphasize the primacy of personal rights and\nfreedoms^12,13,14,15. Others suggested that the global diffusion of\nindustrialization would break down traditional culture and replace it with\n\u201cmodern\u201d class structures and values^16,17. These perspectives shared an\nassumption of unilineal modernization: that modern technology and\nglobalization should lead world cultures to increasingly resemble democratic\nWestern nations.\n\nScholars became more skeptical of these theories as cultural conflicts emerged\nacross the globe throughout the 21st century. New theoretical models arose\nduring this time, with varying levels of overlap with the older theories.\nInglehart\u2019s postmaterialist thesis suggested that globalization alone does not\nlead to cultural convergence, but that economic development in particular\ninduces a shift from values prioritizing group obedience to values\nprioritizing self-expression and individual autonomy^9,18. Welzel labeled\nthese latter values as \u201cemancipative,\u201d and proposed a \u201chuman empowerment\u201d\nsequence in which wealth and security encourage cultures to espouse more\nemancipatory values, which in turn foster participatory democracy^8.\nEmancipative values bear a conceptual overlap and statistical correlation with\nindividualizing values. Both emphasize the autonomy and needs of the\nindividual over those of the group^8. The post-materialist thesis therefore\nreproduces the assumption that cultural convergence will inherently be in the\ndirection of Western individualism, but adds the caveat that this convergence\nrequires economic prosperity and financial security.\n\nOther theories broke further from modernization theories. Eisenstadt\u2019s\nmultiple modernities thesis proposed that economic development would not be a\nWesternizing force, but would set national cultures on unique paths towards\nmodernization^19,20. Tomlinson similarly argued that globalization might\npromote states in the developing world to actively develop and reinforce\ndistinct national identities rather than Westernize^21. Huntington went one\nstep further, predicting that post-Cold War globalization would lead to a\nresurgence of cultural divides based on religious and linguistic differences\nassociated with historical civilizations^22.\n\nTogether, these theories offer a spectrum of competing hypotheses. From one\nperspective, high- and low-income countries should be experiencing a gradual\nconvergence of values brought on by globalization. From another perspective,\nthis convergence might only characterize countries that have become wealthier\nover time. And from the other extreme, countries should be diverging in their\nvalues, and this divergence might even be sharpest among high-income\ncountries.\n\nEvolutionary models also offer mixed predictions for value convergence. These\nmodels state that cultural differences can arise from socioecological\npressures involving subsistence style^23, population pressure^7, resource\nscarcity^2, climate^24, and pathogen load^25,26. Cultural values and norms\noften promote behavior that is adaptive in light of these pressures^27.\nSometimes these values and norms emerge over long periods of history, but they\nalso can change quickly^25,26, which evolutionary psychologists have termed\n\u201cevoked culture\u201d^28,29.\n\nGiven the co-evolution between culture and ecology, one might expect that\nvalues should converge if people\u2019s environments have also become more similar.\nIn some specific ways, environments do seem to be more similar. The decline of\nbiodiversity and the diffusion of new technology mean that people around the\nworld consume the same foods and use the same products with greater ease than\never before^21,30. However, because socioecological diversity is\nmultidimensional and hard-to-quantify, the question of whether there has been\na definitive trend toward environmental homogeneity remains open. Even if\nthere is a trend towards environmental homogeneity, it could be affecting\ncountries in the same regions more than countries across the globe^31. Studies\nhave found that countries in the same trading blocs have developed more\nsimilar economic, demographic, financial, and political characteristics over\ntime, whereas countries from different trading blocs have not become more\nsimilar^32.\n\nThe influence of Western mass media may be the most intuitive force of\ncultural convergence. Social learning is the dominant method through which\nhumans transmit cultural values and norms^33, and the diffusion of films,\ntelevision, the internet, and educational materials have made it easier to\nlearn about the United States that any other country^34. A recent analysis\nfound that educational attainment correlated with cultural similarity to the\nUnited States across the world, suggesting educational attainment may\npropagate Western values^35. Yet there is less evidence that non-educational\nmass media is a Westernizing force. Some countries specifically ban or\nregulate Western media^36,37. Even when foreign media is unregulated, people\noften prefer national and regional content^38. And when people do consume\nforeign media, there is no clear evidence that it leads them to accept foreign\nvalues. Studies that use media as an intervention tool to change norms in non-\nWestern cultural groups have been careful to work with local organizations to\nproduce culture-specific productions instead of emulating Western media^39,40.\nA mass media perspective, like an ecological perspective, offers no clear\npredictions for whether national cultures are converging or diverging in their\nvalues.\n\nThe World Values Survey (WVS) has become the proving ground for hypotheses\nabout contemporary value change^41. The WVS is a multi-panel survey of 450,869\ndemographically representative people across 105 countries, with multiple\nwaves of data from 76 of these countries (406,185 people). The first timepoint\n(wave) of this survey took place in 1981, and the seventh timepoint completed\ndata collection in 2021. Few studies have examined every WVS timepoint, but\nmany have analyzed changes in the mean level of key values or value dimensions\nacross subsets of timepoint and countries^32,42,43,44,45. Some studies have\nargued for global trends on specific values. One analysis documented a global\nrise of individualism^46. Another study reported that emancipative values are\ndiffusing around the world, but this diffusion has been more rapid in liberal\ndemocracies than in other government types^47. Other research has focused on\nspecific world regions. For example, membership within the European Union\n(E.U.) is associated with greater value similarity with other E.U. countries\nover time but also with value divergence from Central Asian countries^45,48.\nThe most thorough analysis to date compared responses on three WVS\nquestionnaires across 18 countries at two timepoints (1990s vs. 2010s)^49. It\nreported a worldwide shift among these countries towards cultural traits\ntypical of rich Western individualist countries, but also heterogeneity in\neffect sizes across the questionnaires. Together, these studies provide\ninsights into contemporary changes in specific social values or among small\nsamples of countries but few conclusions about worldwide trends towards value\nconvergence vs. divergence across a large and heterogeneous pool of countries.\n\nIn this work, we develop a general method to test whether social values have\ndiverged or converged across the 76 countries that have provided multiple\nwaves of WVS data. Instead of focusing on the mean levels of particular values\nover time, as in most prior studies, we create metrics that explicitly measure\nvariation in values (see Table 1). These measures are meant to represent the\nsame outcome\u2014convergence vs. divergence of values across world nations.\nHowever, they vary in their level of analysis. The first measure, \u201cvalue\nvariation,\u201d focuses on divergence at the level of the WVS item whereas the\nsecond measure, \u201cvalue distinctiveness,\u201d focuses on divergence at the country\nlevel. Table 1 describes both measures and defines a third measure called\n\u201cwithin-country heterogeneity,\u201d which we use in secondary analyses to\nrepresent the homogeneity vs. heterogeneity of values within a nation. We\ndefine all three measures here so that readers can distinguish between them in\nour presentation of results.\n\nTables 1 Descriptions of key measures\n\nFull size table\n\nOur main analyses test whether value variation and value distinctiveness are\nincreasing or decreasing over time. Increases indicate value divergence, and\ndecreases indicate value convergence. We try to test this relationship as\nrigorously as possible. For example, we include several robustness checks to\nensure that the results are not driven by the way we normalize the items or\nthe sampling strategy of the WVS. In our main text, we complement our primary\nanalyses by analyzing different subsets of countries and by exploring\ngeopolitical variables that can explain country-level clustering based on\nvalue similarity. Supplemental analyses show that results replicate with\ndifferent approaches to normalizing means for items that have different\nresponse scales and across demographically weighted and unweighted country-\nlevel scores. Our materials and methods summarize our analysis procedure, and\nthe Supplementary Methods have an \u201cextended\u201d materials and methods section\nwith more detail.\n\nHere we use this approach to show that values have diverged across national\ncultures over time. This value divergence mainly characterizes a growing gap\nbetween high-income Western countries and the rest of the world on\nemancipative values. We also find that worldwide value divergence has been\naccompanied by value convergence among countries in the same region.\n\n## Results\n\n### Value divergence at the item level\n\nWe first examined general trends towards value convergence or divergence using\nour value variation measure, which allowed us to estimate effects at the item\nlevel. Our results strongly supported value divergence. A mixed effects model\nwith value variation nested in the 40 items found that timepoint has been\nsignificantly associated with greater value variation, b = 0.004, SE = 0.0007,\nt(239) = 5.12, p < 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.17, 95% CIs [0.002, 0.005]. We\nreplicated this result using a different approach in which we correlated\ntimepoint with value variation separately for each of the 40 value items. Of\nthe 40 values, we found that 27 have diverged over time, with a positive\nmedian correlation of 0.28 between timepoint and value variation, t(39) =\n3.30, p = 0.002, M_diff = 0.28, 95% CIs [0.11, 0.45]. Coefficients associated\nwith each item are displayed in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1: Change in global value variation (SD of normalized country means) for\neach of the 40 WVS items in our analysis.\n\nEach bar represents a correlation coefficient between timepoint and value\nvariation for a given value (value labels are listed on the y-axis). Positive\nbars indicate that value variation is rising, and that values are diverging.\nNegative bars indicate that value variation is falling, and values are\nconverging. The fill color indicates the absolute value of the correlation of\neach item with Welzel\u2019s index of emancipative values^8; brighter bars\ncorrelate either highly positively or negatively on this index.\n\nFull size image\n\nHave certain kinds of values diverged more than others? To test this question,\nwe measured how much each item related to Welzel\u2019s dimensions of \u201csacred vs.\nsecular\u201d values and \u201cemancipative vs. obedient\u201d values^8,27. Welzel developed\nthese dimensions to differentiate between values that uphold or reject\ntradition and religion (sacred-secular values) from those that foster or\nrestrict the freedom of the individual from the group (emancipative-obedient\nvalues)^8. We found that a broad set of items loaded on the secular-sacred\ndimension, ranging from the justifiability of cheating on taxes (0.46), to the\nconfidence in churches (0.46), to the justifiability of euthanasia (0.37). A\nnarrower set of items loaded on the emancipative-obedient dimension. Of the\nexamples above, only justifiability of euthanasia loaded above 0.35 (0.44).\n\nWe found that the rate of value divergence correlated with loading on the\nemancipative-obedient dimension, r(38) = 0.54, p < 0.001, but not the sacred-\nsecular dimension, r(38) = 0.19, p = 0.237. This is clearly visible in Fig. 1.\nThe 7 items with the highest divergence scores each have high loadings on the\nemancipative-obedient dimension. These values were (1) justifiability of\nhomosexuality, (2) justifiability of euthanasia, (3) importance of obedience\nof children, (4) justifiability of divorce, (5) justifiability of\nprostitution, (6) justifiability of suicide, and (7) justifiability of\nabortion. National cultures are diverging the most on their tolerance of\nindividual expression versus emphasis on group obedience. Supplementary Fig. 1\nreproduces Fig. 1 with shading based on secular-sacred instead of\nemancipative-obedient loading.\n\nOur approach allowed us to understand the nature and magnitude of divergence\non emancipative values. From the first to the last timepoint, value variation\nacross countries increased 141% for justifiability of homosexuality, 94% for\njustifiability of prostitution, 61% for justifiability of euthanasia, and 42%\nfor importance of childhood obedience (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2: Divergence of key values over time.\n\nA Value variation (SD of the global distribution of normalized country means)\nat each WVS timepoint for the 7 items which have diverged most over time. Item\nlabels are at the top of the figure. Bars are shaded by timepoint. B\nNormalized mean endorsement of the same 7 items by timepoint, with separate\nlines for continents. All items are coded so that higher scores reflect higher\nloadings on the index of emancipative values.\n\nFull size image\n\nDivergence on emancipative values is increasingly distinguishing Western\ncountries from non-Western ones. Consider the case of Australia and Pakistan.\nThe first time Australians were surveyed in the WVS, 39% of participants cited\nchildhood obedience as an important quality in children, and participants\nrated divorce as more unjustifiable than justifiable (0.45). When Pakistanis\nwere first surveyed, their responses were not so different: 32% cited\nchildhood obedience as an important childhood quality and participants rated\ndivorce as more unjustifiable than justifiable (0.10). Over time, however,\nthese views diverged. The last time that they were surveyed, only 18% of\nAustralians compared to 49% of Pakistanis cited childhood obedience as an\nimportant quality, and Australians viewed divorce as much more justifiable\n(0.74) than Pakistanis (0.15). From the 1980s to the 2020s, similar fault\nlines emerged between Western and non-Western countries.\n\nRises in value variation for the 7 most divergent items are displayed in Fig.\n2A. The clearest rises in value variation come from timepoints 1\u20135 and plateau\nacross timepoints 5\u20137. Figure 2B illustrates changes over time in the means of\nthese 7 values, which are aggregated to the continent level and coded such\nthat higher values mean more emancipative values. This plot shows that\nOceanic, European, North American, and South American countries have\nprogressively endorsed more emancipative values, whereas endorsement of these\nvalues has been stable across Asian and African countries. Divergence on some\nvalues is driven by countries moving in opposite directions, as in the case of\nAustralia vs. Pakistan on the value of childhood obedience (see Supplementary\nTable 16 for other examples). Other values diverged because their mean rate of\nendorsement changed in some countries but remained the same in others. We\nprovide detailed methodological details about these items and countries in our\nSupplementary Information (e.g., Supplementary Tables 2\u20135).\n\n### Value divergence at the country level\n\nWe next replicated and extended these findings using our country-level value\ndistinctiveness measure, in which we calculated each country\u2019s deviation from\nthe global median of each value. We first regressed this distinctiveness score\non timepoint in a mixed effects model with observations nested in values,\ncountries, and continents. This approach helped us account for the non-\nindependence of countries within the same continent in our data analysis.\nValue distinctiveness has been rising over time, b = 0.003, SE = 0.0005,\nt(9290) = 4.98, p < 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.05, 95% CIs [0.002, 0.004],\nindicating that countries have diverged in their values. We replicated this\neffect while controlling for spatial autocorrelation more continuously using\nan approach similar to the one we used to calculate value distinctiveness, b =\n0.003, SE = 0.0005, t(9351) = 5.18, p < 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.05, 95% CIs\n[0.002, 0.004] (see Supplementary Methods for details). This continuous method\nfurther addressed the concern that our results might have been biased by\ninterdependence of datapoints, often called \u201cGalton\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nAnother concern is that these findings might be confounded with cohort\neffects, meaning that value divergence has resulted in changes in the WVS\nsampling strategy over time. If the cohorts of the WVS are becoming\nincreasingly diverse, then the mean level of value distinctiveness would rise\neven if countries\u2019 values stayed consistent over time. We took several steps\nto address this concern. First, we used centering to separate each country\u2019s\ngeneral value distinctiveness across all waves (representing a cohort effect)\nfrom its change over time from wave to wave (representing a longitudinal\neffect). A model including both variables found that the longitudinal effect\nwas significant, b = 0.003, SE = 0.0006, t(10,520) = 4.92, p < 0.001,\n\\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.04, 95% CIs [0.002, 0.004], but the cohort effect was not, b =\n0.002, SE = 0.003, t(49.82) = 0.68, p = 0.503, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.02, 95% CIs\n[\u22120.004, 0.009].\n\nSecond, we recomputed value variation and replicated our models among\nsubsamples of countries that had less turnover and hence less susceptibility\nto cohort changes. We replicated value divergence among the 54 countries that\nparticipated in at least 3 waves, b = 0.003, SE = 0.0006, t(8599) = 4.82, p <\n0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.05, 95% CIs [0.002, 0.004], the 32 countries that\nparticipated in at least 4 waves, b = 0.003, SE = 0.0006, t(6145) = 4.12, p <\n0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.05, 95% CIs [0.001, 0.004], and the 18 countries that\nparticipated in at least 5 waves, b = 0.003, SE = 0.0007, t(4059) = 3.73, p <\n0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.05, 95% CIs [0.001, 0.004]. These results provided\nfurther evidence that value divergence is not an artifact of changing sampling\nstrategy over time, but arose from national cultures changing in diverging\ndirections over time.\n\nThird, we replicated the finding in sample with no turnover in sample\ncomposition\u2014a subset of 33 countries that provided data in the 1990s, 2000s,\nand 2010s, which were the three decades with the greatest WVS coverage. Value\ndistinctiveness was higher in the 2000s, b = 0.01, SE = 0.003, t(78) = 4.05, p\n< 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.29, 95% CIs [0.007, 0.02], and the 2010s, b = 0.01,\nSE = 0.003, t(78) = 2.66, p = 0.010, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.19, 95% CIs [0.002,\n0.02], compared to the 1990s. However, we found no significant difference\nbetween the 2000s vs. 2010s, b = \u22120.004, SE = 0.003, t(39) = \u22121.41, p = 0.167,\n\\\\(\\beta\\\\) = \u22120.10, 95% CIs [\u22120.01, 0.002]. This decade-based analysis\nprovides evidence for value divergence even when we fix the country sample\nover time. It also suggests that value divergence has been non-linear. In our\nSupplementary Methods, we evaluate different non-linear models of value\ndivergence. These models suggest that the pace of value divergence has\ngradually slowed over time, rather than halting at a particular point.\n\nAnalyzing value distinctiveness across countries also allowed us to estimate\nwhich countries have become most dissimilar from the rest of the world.\nInglehart\u2019s post-materialist thesis suggests that high-income countries may\nhold especially distinctive values, at least in the domain of morality and\ntolerance. However, a range of other geopolitical variables could also lead\ncultures to adopt distinctive social values, including wealth inequality^50,\ndistance from the equator^51, globalization^19, and the presence of a liberal\ndemocracy^47. We accessed data on these geopolitical metrics over time, and\ntested whether they could predict which countries were more distinctive and\nwhich countries were less distinctive. We retained the random effects\nstructure from our previous mixed effects models to fit these results without\nviolating any model assumptions.\n\nIn our regression analysis, GDP per capita was the only variable that\nsignificantly predicted value distinctiveness (see Table 2), b = 0.08, SE =\n0.01, t(600.59) = 8.05, p < 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.18, 95% CIs [0.06, 0.10],\nwith the positive coefficient indicating that higher-income countries have\nmore distinctive values than lower-income countries. No other predictors\nreached significance (ps > 0.05). In our Supplementary Table 8, we show that\nother geopolitical variables are not significantly linked to value\ndistinctiveness, even when we remove GDP per capita from the model.\n\nTable 2 Associations with value distinctiveness in multiple regression\n\nFull size table\n\nFurther analyses found that the association between GDP per capita and value\ndistinctiveness varied across world region. Wealth was associated with value\ndistinctiveness among European countries, b = 0.08, SE = 0.02, t(18.76) =\n3.63, p = 0.002, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.18, 95% CIs [0.04, 0.12]. However, in a\nregression model where we interacted GDP per capita with continent dummy-\ncodes, we found that, compared to Europe, the effect of GDP per capita was\nsignificantly weaker in Asia, b = \u22120.10, SE = 0.04, t(16.66) = \u22122.84, p =\n0.011, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = \u22120.23, 95% CIs [\u22120.16, \u22120.04], and Africa, b = \u22120.21, SE\n= 0.10, t(122.60) = \u22122.13, p = 0.036, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = \u22120.50, 95% CIs [\u22120.40,\n\u22120.02]. The association between GDP per capita and value distinctiveness was\nnon-significant in both Africa, b = \u22120.14, SE = 0.10, t(109.20) = \u22121.38, p =\n0.171, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = \u22120.32, 95% CIs [\u22120.32, 0.06], and Asia, b = \u22120.02, SE =\n0.03, t(16.24) = \u22120.78, p = 0.448, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = \u22120.05, 95% CIs [\u22120.08, 0.03].\nThese continent comparison models were based on smaller subsets of countries,\nwith 48 countries in the Europe vs. Asia comparison (simulated power = 80.20%)\nand 36 countries in the Europe vs. Africa comparison (simulated power =\n98.00%). Readers should therefore interpret these findings with more caution\nthan the tests that included the full sample of countries. Supplementary Table\n13 summarizes the complete set of coefficients for these models. Our\nSupplementary Methods provide more details about the power analysis\nsimulations.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates many of the findings that we have presented in a single\nplot, with countries ordered along the y-axis based on their continent and on\ntheir level of value distinctiveness within continents. The x-axis illustrates\neach country\u2019s value distinctiveness score at the first WVS timepoint and the\nfinal WVS timepoint, and each country\u2019s GDP per capita is shown on the left of\nthe y-axis. In this visualization, it is clear that most countries have\ndiverged from the rest of the world, with more distinctive values at the final\nvs. the first timepoint. Second, in Western regions but not non-Western\nregions, divergence has been most stark for high-income countries.\n\nFig. 3: Value distinctiveness of each country over time.\n\nValue distinctiveness is the distance between values in a given country and\nthe global median. Countries are organized by continent, and within continent,\nby value distinctiveness at the final timepoint in which the country reported\ndata. Yellow (blue) nodes represent countries whose distinctiveness scores\nhave increased (decreased) over time. Gray nodes represent value\ndistinctiveness at the first timepoint. The GDP Per Capita of each country\n(measured at the final timepoint for each country) is displayed to the left of\nthe plot.\n\nFull size image\n\nThese findings suggest a provocative possibility: rises in global wealth may\nbe responsible for the worldwide divergence of values. Most countries have\nbecome wealthier over time\u2014Western countries but also many non-Western\ncountries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea^52. This means that most\ncountries were poorer in the earlier (vs. later) waves of the WVS. Western\nnations in these early waves held more emancipative values than non-Western\nnations, but not by a large degree. As time passed, rising wealth led Western\ncountries to adopt more emancipative values, but it did not have the same\neffect for most non-Western countries. These trends led to a growing gap\nbetween high-income Western countries and the rest of the world.\n\nConsider Hong Kong and Canada, where GDP per capita has followed a similar\ntrend, but values have diverged. Both countries had a GDP per capita of\napproximately $25,000 in 2000, which doubled to approximately $50,000 by\n2020^53,54. Over the same time interval, beliefs that homosexuality was\njustifiable rose in Canada from 0.49/1.00 to 0.74/1.00. Perceived\njustifiability of homosexuality also rose in Hong Kong, but only from\n0.29/1.00 to 0.44/1.00. This means that the gap in means between Hong Kong and\nCanada increased by 50% during this period. One of the fastest-changing values\nin Hong Kong during this time was belief in children\u2019s work ethic. From 2000\nto 2021, the percent of Hong Kong participants who mentioned responsibility as\nan important childhood quality rose from 19% to 52%, whereas it fell from 53%\nto 47% in Canada.\n\nThis example shows that wealth can sometimes lead to region-specific effects\non values. If rising wealth fosters emancipative values in some regions but\nnot in others, this could explain why Western democracies have developed more\ndistinct values over time. This would be consistent with Eisenstadt, whose\n\u201cmultiple modernities\u201d thesis states that countries follow their own\ntrajectories of modernization^19. It is also consistent with Huntington\u2019s\nobservations that rising wealth and influence in East Asia could lead to a re-\naffirmation of traditional Confucian values^22. Factors such as migration,\npolitical change, and decolonialization could also contribute to these trends.\nFor example, sovereignty over Hong Kong transitioned from the United Kingdom\nto China in 1997, which may have affected people\u2019s values. More research is\nnecessary to determine the causal relationship, if any, between wealth and\nvalue change.\n\n### Within-country heterogeneity and value distinctiveness\n\nIn our next analysis, we explored whether value distinctiveness across\ncountries was correlated with the heterogeneity of values within countries. In\nother words, are countries where citizens disagree on values more like the\nrest of the world than countries where citizens have more homogeneous values?\n\nWe calculated within-country heterogeneity using the same approach that we\nused to calculate value distinctiveness. But instead of taking the difference\nof country means from the global mean across values, we took the deviation of\nindividual ratings from the country mean. Higher levels of within-country\nheterogeneity therefore represent a country with high levels of disagreement\namong its citizens. For example, high within-country heterogeneity in the\nUnited States might arise because liberal and conservative Americans hold very\ndifferent values. In exploratory analyses, we analyzed whether within-country\nheterogeneity was also rising across time, signaling a divergence within\ncountries. However, we did not find general trends in this measure. Within-\ncountry heterogeneity seems to be rising among some countries and falling\namong others (see Supplementary Methods).\n\nHowever, we did find that within-country heterogeneity was closely linked to\nvalue distinctiveness. When we regressed value distinctiveness on within-\ncountry heterogeneity controlling for GDP per capita, Gini, globalization,\npolitical rights, and distance from equator, within-country heterogeneity\nrobustly and negatively predicted value distinctiveness, b = \u22120.06, SE = 0.01,\nt(8,032) = \u22124.45, p < 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = \u22120.07, 95% CIs [\u22120.09, \u22120.03]. In\nother words, countries where citizens agree more on values tend to be more\ndifferent from other countries. The other effects in this model remained\nunchanged. GDP per capita had a positive relationship and no other variables\nhad significant associations (see Supplementary Table 12). Figure 4 visualizes\nthe relationship between within-country heterogeneity and value\ndistinctiveness. Our Supplementary Methods reports timepoint specific models.\n\nFig. 4: Association between within-country heterogeneity and value\ndistinctiveness.\n\nThe best fit line comes from a general linear model estimate, and the shading\nrepresents the standard error centered around the best fit line. Data-point\nsize represents GDP per capita, and datapoint fill color represents whether\ncountry values have diverged (value distinctiveness has increased) or\nconverged (value distinctiveness has decreased) over time.\n\nFull size image\n\nThese results suggest that as countries develop more homogenous values, they\nmay increasingly splinter from viewpoints that are shared around the rest of\nthe world. This has happened in high-income Western nations like Sweden and\nNorway, where there is a higher consensus around emancipative values such as\njustifiability of divorce and abortion. But it has also happened in poorer\nnations such as China and Ghana, where consensus has formed on different\nvalues. In contrast, countries with heterogeneous values such as South Africa\nand India may struggle with internal division, but when averaging across their\nsubpopulations, these countries\u2019 values may resemble those of other countries.\n\n### What country characteristics predict value similarity over time?\n\nIn our final analysis, we explored which countries hold similar values to one\nanother. We first fit a principal components analysis (PCA) to detect\nunderlying dimensions in how the 40 values varied across nations. Two\nprincipal components (PCs) explained 80.70% of variation (see Materials and\nMethods). To understand the meaning of these dimensions, we regressed each\ndimension against previously developed dimensions of value variation: Welzel\u2019s\nsecular values and emancipative values, and Inglehart\u2019s 12-item post-\nmaterialist index. PC1 was strongly positively linked to emancipative values,\nb = 0.76, SE = 0.04, t(215.60) = 19.46, p < 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.77, 95% CIs\n[0.67, 0.84], and to secular values, b = 0.26, SE = 0.03, t(233.90) = 8.60, p\n< 0.001, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = 0.26, 95% CIs [0.20, 0.32]. PC2 had a smaller and less\nrobust relationship with secular values, b = \u22120.13, SE = 0.07, t(194.81) =\n\u22122.10, p = 0.042, \\\\(\\beta\\\\) = \u22120.13, 95% CIs [\u22120.27, 0.009]. No effects\ninvolving the choice index were robust (see Supplementary Methods for more\ninformation about these models).\n\nWe used these PCs as coordinates in a two-dimensional value space in which\ncountries with similar values are closer together than nations with different\nvalues (see Fig. 5). We next fit regression models for each timepoint to test\nwhether geopolitical characteristics could explain which countries were closer\ntogether in value space and which countries were further apart.\n\nFig. 5: Explaining value similarity across countries.\n\nA Wave 7 country values projected on a two-dimensional space derived from a\nPCA of all 40 values. Proximity in this space indicates value similarity, and\nlabel color indicates continent. B A reproduction of (A) with countries as\nnodes colored by continent (left) and GDP per capita (right). C The\nassociation between pairwise differences in five geopolitical variables and\nvalue distance across nations, which involved n = 11 countries at Time 1, n =\n20 countries at Time 2, n = 48 countries at Time 3, n = 37 countries at Time\n4, n = 52 countries at Time 5, n = 54 countries at Time 6, and n = 52\ncountries at Time 7. Each node represents a regression coefficient, and these\ncoefficients have been standardized so that they could be interpreted as\neffect sizes. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals centered around the\nregression coefficients.\n\nFull size image\n\nThese regressions found that wealth has been the strongest correlate of value\nsimilarity across nations over time. High-income countries share values with\nother high-income countries, and poor countries share values with poor\ncountries. This effect is visible in Fig. 5 (middle right), where high-income\ncountries like New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan are clustered\ntogether on the right side of the value space. We also note that the left side\nof the value space in Fig. 5 is denser than the right side, which replicates\nour prior analysis: high-income countries have developed more dissimilar\nvalues compared to the rest of the world, primarily because of their unique\nendorsement of emancipative values.\n\nWe also found that geographic proximity has become progressively more\ncorrelated with value similarity over time, with an effect size rising from\n0.16 (Timepoint 1) to 0.35 (Timepoint 7). This is visible in Fig. 5A: high-\nincome East Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore are closer together\nthan high-income Western nations like New Zealand and the Netherlands. The\nrising predictive power of geographic proximity suggests that values are\nconverging within regions but are diverging across regions.\n\nReligion has also emerged as a robust predictor of value similarity. Countries\nwith more similar religious profiles have more similar values, even\ncontrolling for their similarity in wealth, geographic position, and other\ngeopolitical features. This finding conceptually replicates a recent analysis\nthat found that co-religionists\u2014even those living in similar countries\u2014shared\nsimilar values^55. The fact that values are segregating along geographical and\nreligious fault-lines further supports Huntington\u2019s thesis that the 21st\ncentury would see a rise of ancestral cleavages in values. By the final WVS\ntimepoint, religious similarity and geographic proximity were stronger\ncorrelates of value similarity than having similar levels of inequality or\npolitical rights. Figure 5 plots out the associations of value similarity with\neach form of geopolitical similarity at each timepoint. Table 3 lists key\ncoefficients from the value similarity regressions.\n\nTable 3 Effects and Confidence Intervals from Clustering Analysis Regressions\n\nFull size table\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe find that values have diverged from 1981 to 2022 across 76 countries. Value\ndivergence appears to be strongest for values related to tolerance and\nopenness and can be explained by the rising difference between high-income\nWestern countries and the rest of the world. Regional value convergence has\naccompanied worldwide divergence, with geographically proximal countries\nadopting more similar values over time.\n\nOur Supplementary Methods present many robustness tests that replicate our key\nfindings with different sampling strategies, normalization procedures, and\ndemographic weighting. They also include an additional literature review that\nsummarizes previous research on modern cultural differences in values and\nother metrics of cultural distance in greater depth.\n\nThese robustness analyses lend more support to our conclusions, but there are\nstill important limitations to this study. First, we can only claim that\nvalues have diverged across the 40 items in our analysis. These items include\na wide range of different values. However, they are not an exhaustive list of\nvalues across countries, and our results could change if they were replicated\non a different set of items. Second, our samples are not perfectly\nrepresentative of populations in the countries that we have analyzed. The WVS\nattempts to emulate key dimensions of representativeness, but it may sometimes\nneglect responses from key demographics, such as indigenous populations. For\nthese reasons, it will be important to replicate our analyses in new datasets.\nFew datasets have data on social values that match the WVS, but this may\nchange as new cross-cultural surveys are launched and analyzed over time.\n\nWhile acknowledging these limitations, we also view our findings as\npotentially impactful from both a theoretical and practical standpoint.\nTheoretically, our findings suggest that globalization and intergroup contact\nalone are not sufficient to produce converging social values. Our findings\nalso suggest that the post-materialist hypothesis\u2014that wealth breeds\nemancipative values and tolerance^8,9\u2014may have stronger predictive power in\nsome regions than others. Our findings support key parts of other theories but\ndo not completely align with any single theory of culture and values. We\nobserve worldwide divergence of values accompanied by re-alignment of values\nalong regional and religious fault-lines, which is consistent with\nHuntington\u2019s civilizations thesis and more recent work on rises in\ngeopolitical regionalism from macroeconomics^56. We also find that this effect\nof wealth varies across Western and non-Western countries, consistent with\nEisenstadt\u2019s multiple modernities theory and with other studies that highlight\nAsia\u2019s unique modernization trajectory^57. It may be that our findings are\nspecific to a particular period of time following decolonization and the end\nof the Cold War (1981\u20132022) and that we would have found different results at\ndifferent periods of time. Only time will tell if our findings represent a\ngeneral cultural trend or a historically isolated phenomenon.\n\nValue divergence could also explain theoretical puzzles in the social\nsciences. For example, there is a popular theory that rising wealth^4 and\ntechnology^58 facilitate religious decline because they decrease existential\ninsecurity and relieve the economic pressure to have children^59. But this\nmodel does not explain why rising wealth has not brought religious declines in\nMiddle Eastern countries and has even correlated with rising religiosity in\nsome of these countries. One possibility is that these declines will happen\nwith time, especially with generational change. In other words, countries like\nSaudi Arabia and Qatar may not have been high-income long enough to experience\nsecularization. However, another possibility is that Islam has emerged as a\nkey part of Arabic post-colonial identity. Rising wealth and influence could\nhave led Arab countries to emphasize the religious part of their identity to\ndistinguish themselves from the West.\n\nOur findings answer some important questions about contemporary value change,\nbut they also pose new ones. Why has rising wealth led Western, but not non-\nWestern, nations to espouse more emancipative values? We believe that this\nrelationship might be embedded in ecological and cultural events throughout\nWestern history, including the advent of participatory democracy in Athens and\nearly Rome, enlightenment and post-enlightenment philosophy, the Catholic\nChurch\u2019s marriage and family polices^60, the French revolution, and the\nreformation^61. These phenomena may have gradually solidified a Western\nidentity focused on autonomy, primacy of individual rights over obligations to\nthe in-group, and tolerance for breaking norms^2,60,62. As the world has\nglobalized and Western nations have competed for resources on the world stage,\nthis identity may have crystalized even further. But this does not mean that\nwealth or globalization should have encouraged similar values in African, East\nAsian, or South Asian cultures. To the contrary, growing power and resources\nmay have prompted non-Western countries to affirm their own traditional\nvalues.\n\nPractically, value divergence has implications for political polarization and\nconflict across world countries. Russia has framed the recent war in Ukraine\nas a war against Western values^40. Chinese politicians have spoken against\ncountries that \u201cforcibly promote the concept and system of Western democracy\nand human rights\u201d^63. Western non-governmental organizations have faced recent\naccusations of seeding immorality and propagating Western imperialism^64, and\npublic opinion polling has found increasingly hostile attitudes towards\nWestern countries in the Middle East^65, Asia^66, and Africa^67. Our findings\ndo not shed light on the extent of the anti-Western sentiment or the exact\nnature of its antecedents and consequences. We do not know to what extent\ngovernments strategically propagate certain values to reinforce national\nidentities, as Tomlinson^21 would suggest. One goal of future research could\nbe to understand the extent that political elites have encouraged value\ndivergence among ordinary citizens.\n\nOur research also underscores the limitations of studying Westerners to make\nclaims about human psychology writ large. Cross-cultural scholars have pointed\nout that people from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic\n(WEIRD) countries have psychological traits that differ from the rest of the\nworld. This peculiarity presents an external validity problem for studies that\nrecruit mostly WEIRD subjects, and it also presents an intellectual problem\nfor cultural evolutionists who hope to explain regional variation. We show\nthat this problem has become more acute in the last forty years. WEIRD\nsubjects have become even more peculiar, at least in their social and moral\nvalues. This shift makes it more crucial than ever that behavioral scientists\ndevelop their theories using data from globally representative samples.\n\n## Methods\n\nHere we report key parts of our methodology and analysis plan. Our\nSupplementary Methods contain an extended materials and methods section with\nfurther information.\n\n### Ethics\n\nThe director of the Social and Behavioral Science IRB office at University of\nChicago determined that our research does not require IRB approval, since the\nnature of this research\u2014analyzing archival deidentified data\u2014does not quality\nas human subjects research.\n\n### The World Values Survey\n\nThe World Values Survey (WVS) is an international research program devoted to\nmeasuring the social, political, economic, and religious values of individuals\naround the world using regular surveys. The WVS website contains comprehensive\ninformation about its research procedures (https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org).\nThis includes information about translation procedures and fieldwork training.\nIn addition to publishing data each wave, the WVS publishes a time-series file\ncontaining data from all waves. The WVS has not surveyed the same people over\ntime in this file. Rather, each timepoint contains a demographically\nrepresentative snapshot of people in a country at a particular point in time.\nThe WVS also publishes a list of variables indicating which items are asked in\ndifferent waves, and a list of countries indicating which countries are\nsurveyed in each wave. The timeseries dataset is published in many different\nformats. We downloaded the Rdata format.\n\n#### Characteristics of countries\n\nWe focused on the 76 countries where the WVS has collected data for at least\ntwo waves, a necessary condition since we are interested in change over time.\nSupplementary Table 1 summarizes the age-sex composition of each country in\neach wave, with dashes indicating waves where a country was not included in\ndata collection. Samples are designed to be representative of people age 18\nand older residing within private residences in each country, regardless of\ncitizenship or language. The WVS employs probability sampling and stratified\nsampling to achieve these targets. They offer case weights to compensate for\nsmall deviations with respect to gender-age (self-reported), rural-urban, or\neducational attainment.\n\n#### Characteristics of Items\n\nThe WVS contains a heterogeneous set of items that change each year. Of the\n1,011 items included in the WVS timeseries file, most were only included in a\nminority of waves. We focused on the items that were asked in all seven waves,\nand specifically on items that could be construed broadly as values. In total,\nwe selected 40 items for analysis. Our extended Supplementary Methods\nsummarize how we selected these items and excluded others. In Supplementary\nTable 2, we provide the item identification number, item label, and the scale\nthat participants used to respond to the item. Readers can access the complete\nitem wording for each item by downloading one of the PDF questionnaires for\nany wave from the WVS website.\n\nOne of the scales in our analysis involved the qualities that respondents felt\nto be important for children to learn. For these items, respondents were not\nallowed to select more than 5 items. However, during data processing we\nrealized that this rule was not always followed. To keep the questionnaire\nformat consistent across countries and waves, we excluded all respondents (n =\n20,380; 5% of the total sample) who had selected more than 5 important\nchildhood qualities. This decision did not affect our results. All results\nreplicated with and without excluding participants who had not followed the\ninstructions.\n\n### Exogenous variables\n\nWe collected data on exogenous variables illustrating the geopolitical\nconditions of countries over time. We sought to match all exogenous variables\nas closely as possible to the year of WVS data collection, so we downloaded\ntime-varying estimates of these variables. We provide the source and access\nURL for each variable here. Our extended materials and methods provide more\ninformation about each variable.\n\n#### GDP per capita\n\nWe accessed GDP per Capita (current USD) from the World Bank. The access URL\nis https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD.\n\n#### Gini\n\nWe accessed Gini coefficients from the World Inequality Database (WID). The\naccess URL is https://wid.world/data/.\n\n#### Globalization\n\nWe measured globalization using the widely used KOF index published by the\nSwiss Economic Institute. The access URL is\nhttps://www.theglobaleconomy.com/download-data.php.\n\n#### Political rights\n\nWe measured political rights using the \u201cPolitical Rights\u201d index published by\nthe Freedom House. We accessed this variable using the \u201cGlobal Economy\u201d\ndatabase. The access URL is https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/download-\ndata.php. We note that the Freedom House publishes two different indices: a\npolitical rights index and a civil liberties index. Both indices are coded on\na 7-point scale from 1 (Strong) to 7 (Weak). These correlated at 0.94 and\nshowed identical results, so we focused on the political rights index in our\nanalyses. We recoded the index so that higher values meant more political\nrights.\n\n#### Religious distance\n\nWe accessed data on the % of the population identifying as Hindu, Christian,\nMuslim, and Buddhist, and measured religious distance by summing the absolute\ndifference in % of people identifying with each religious group across pairs\nof countries. The access URL is https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/download-\ndata.php.\n\n### Analytic strategy\n\nThis section summarizes how we computed value variation and value\ndistinctiveness. Table 1 summarizes the meaning of these measures, along with\nwithin-country heterogeneity, which we describe in the main text.\n\n#### Item normalization\n\nSupplementary Table 2 shows that items were asked on different scales. Some\nitems involved binary responses (e.g., whether people mention not wanting to\nbe neighbors with someone from a specific group). Others were asked with\nLikert-type scales, such as the 1\u201310 scale that people used to rate whether\nbehaviors were morally justifiable. We normalized the item scales using min-\nmax normalization, which is a common approach in data science and machine\nlearning^68. Given a vector V = [v1, v2, ... vn], we can determine min_V as\nthe minimum value in the vector and max_V as the maximum value in the vector.\nWe can create our normalized vector, V\u2019 using:\n\n$${v}_{i}^{{\\prime} }=\\frac{{v}_{i}-{v}_{\\min }}{{v}_{\\max }-{v}_{\\min }}$$\n\n(1)\n\nIn other words, each element in the new vector is the result of subtracting\nthe minimum value of the original vector from that element, then dividing by\nthe range of the original vector (i.e., the difference between its maximum and\nminimum values). This procedure results in variables with ranges of 0\u20131, no\nmatter their original scales. As an alternative to min-max normalization, we\nalso considered a median split approach. We discuss the limitations of this\napproach in the Supplementary Methods, and show how our main findings\nreplicate with this approach.\n\n#### Calculating value divergence across items\n\nAfter the item-normalization procedure, we took the mean values of items for\neach country. This resulted in country-level means for each item at each\ntimepoint. As an exploratory analysis, we fit Pearson correlations between\ntimepoint and mean for each item, which indicates how values are changing over\ntime across all countries. Supplementary Table 3 lists the full set of trends\nin global mean endorsement of items over time.\n\nWe assessed value divergence across items by computing the standard deviation\nof country means at each WVS timepoint\u2014the measure of \u201cvalue variation\u201d that\nwe summarize in our introduction. We then estimated the linear trend in these\nSD values in a mixed effects model which we summarize in the main text, and\nalso across a set of Pearson correlations that we fit for each individual item\nand that we summarize in Fig. 1. In these models, positive coefficients\nrepresent value divergence, since the SD of country means is increasing over\ntime. In Supplementary Table 4, we report value divergence coefficients for\nfour different subsets of countries\u2014 countries which were included in at least\n2 WVS waves, 3 waves, 4 waves, and 5 waves. We conducted our analyses for\nthese different subsets of countries because we wanted to ensure that value\ndivergence was not due to changing WVS composition over time.\n\nWe calculated the relevance of each item to Welzel\u2019s emancipative and secular\ndimensions by taking the absolute value of the correlation between the item\nand each of the two dimensions to create continuous loading scores. Scores for\nboth dimensions are published as variables in the WVS dataset. The item\nmeasuring participants\u2019 view of \u201cunselfishness\u201d as an important child quality\nhad a loading of 0.01 on the emancipative values dimension and a loading of\n0.003 on the secular values dimension, suggesting it had low relevance for\nboth dimensions. In contrast, the item measuring participants\u2019 views on the\njustifiability of had a loading of 0.56 on the emancipative factor and a\nloading of 0.40 on the secular factor, reflecting higher relevance for both\nfactors. The dimensions correlate at r = 0.36 with each other, suggesting that\nsecular values tend to be more emancipative and that the two dimensions are\nnot redundant.\n\n#### Calculating value distinctiveness\n\nWe followed a multi-step process to calculate value distinctiveness for each\ncountry. First, we computed the global median score for each value at each\ntimepoint. For example, the median score for the item \u201cImportant Child\nQualities: Hard Work\u201d was 0.55 in the third WVS wave. Next, we computed the\nabsolute differences between each country\u2019s mean and the global median for\neach item. For example, the average response to the \u201cHard Work\u201d item in\nAlbania was 0.57, yielding an absolute difference of 0.02. Finally, we\naggregated across all of these absolute differences to obtain a \u201cvalue\ndistinctiveness\u201d score for each country. This process of computing value\ndistinctiveness D_i,j can be expressed as:\n\n$${D}_{i}=\\frac{\\mathop{\\sum\n}\\nolimits_{j=1}^{40}\\left|{n}_{i,j-{{{{{\\rm{median}}}}}}\\left({N}_{1,j},{N}_{2,j},{N}_{3,j}\\ldots\n{N}_{k,j}\\right)}\\right|}{40}$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere n_i,j represents the mean value j of a given country i. We used the\nmedian to compute the global value because it avoided outlier countries from\nhaving a large impact on the mean value.\n\nComputing value distinctiveness across timepoints allowed us to estimate which\ncountries have relatively unique values at any given time. In our main text,\nFig. 3 summarizes each country\u2019s value distinctiveness score in the first and\nlast wave that it was included in the WVS. Supplementary Fig. 2 visualizes\nvalue distinctiveness for each country in each WVS wave, and Supplementary\nTable 5 summarizes value distinctiveness for each country in each wave.\n\nIn addition to estimating the value distinctiveness of individual countries at\nspecific timepoints, we also analyzed general trends in value distinctiveness\nover time. Our reasoning was that, if countries are diverging in their values,\nthe average value distinctiveness coefficient would be increasing. This would\nindicate that countries are \u201cspreading out\u201d around the global medians of\nvalues. One limitation of this analysis is that the global midpoint is not\ntruly \u201cglobal\u201d\u2014it is only the average of the countries sampled by the WVS at a\nparticular point in time. If the WVS has become systematically more diverse in\nits sampling, then this could artificially create value divergence via a trend\nin sample heterogeneity. This is why we repeated all of our analyses for\nsubsets of countries that had participated in 2, 3, 4, and 5 WVS waves. It is\nalso why we conducted the decade-over-decade analysis in which we replicated\nthe finding when looking across a subset of 33 countries which provided data\nin the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s\u2014the three decades with the greatest WVS\ncoverage. Supplementary Table 6 summarizes value distinctiveness scores for\neach decade and for each country within the 33-country sample.\n\n#### Clustering methodology\n\nIn our final analysis, we sought to project countries onto an n-dimensional\nvalue space. Greater distance in this space between a pair of countries would\nrepresent a larger difference between the values of two countries. We could\nalso test which geopolitical variables were most strongly correlated with this\npairwise distance metric.\n\nThe first step in this process was to determine how many dimensions would\nappropriately capture sufficient variance across values. Supplementary Fig. 3\nillustrates the correlations between all 40 items in our dataset. There were\nclear covariances across sets of values, and so we reasoned that a small\nnumber of dimensions might explain considerable variation across values. To\ndetermine the optimal number of dimensions, we fit a Principal Components\nAnalysis (PCA) on the correlation matrix of values (the same matrix displayed\nin Supplementary Fig. 3). In this analysis, PC1 explained 65.4% of variation,\nand PC2 explained 15.3% of variation. No other dimension explained more than\n10% of variation, so we adopted a 2-dimension solution. Supplementary Fig. 3\nshows an elbow plot of variance explained by each PC, and the item loadings.\nWe projected countries onto a two-dimensional value space using these PC item\nloadings multiplied by the country\u2019s scores on each value. This procedure\ngenerated the plots displayed in Fig. 5.\n\nThe regression that we describe in our main text (see Table 2) was fit to a\ndataframe where rows represented pairs of nations, with columns indicating\neach nation in the pairwise comparison. Subsequent columns indicated Euclidean\ndistance in the two-dimensional value space, difference in GDP per capita,\ngeographical distance between nations, etc. We fit a cross-classified mixed\neffects model with random effects for each nation in the pairwise comparison,\nand fixed effects entered simultaneously to control for covariation between\ngeopolitical characteristics. We standardized all variables in the regression\nso that estimates were not influenced by the original measurement scales of\nthe geopolitical variables. More positive values in these fixed effects\nsuggest that countries with similar geopolitical characteristics also have\nmore similar values. For example, a positive effect of GDP per capita would\nsuggest that countries with very similar levels of wealth also have very\nsimilar social values. Changes over time in these coefficients would indicate\nthat a geopolitical variable is becoming better or worse at predicting which\ncountries had more similar values.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data are available on the open science framework at\nhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/F9BZ7. Data on values can also be publicly\ndownloaded from the World Values Survey at https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/.\nData on GDP per capita, annual GDP per capita growth, and the Gini coefficient\nwere retrieved from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/).
