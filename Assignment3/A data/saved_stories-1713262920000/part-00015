The\nstudy's co-authors also found that the event occurred in a dense star forming\nregion of its host galaxy as depicted by the background nebula. Credit: Aaron\nM. Geller / Northwestern / CIERA / IT Research Computing and Data Services\n\nIn October 2022, an international team of researchers, including Northwestern\nUniversity astrophysicists, observed the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever\nrecorded, GRB 221009A.\n\nNow, a Northwestern-led team has confirmed that the phenomenon responsible for\nthe historic burst\u2014dubbed the B.O.A.T. (\"brightest of all time\")\u2014is the\ncollapse and subsequent explosion of a massive star. The team discovered the\nexplosion, or supernova, using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\n\nWhile this discovery solves one mystery, another mystery deepens.\n\nThe researchers speculated that evidence of heavy elements, such as platinum\nand gold, might reside within the newly uncovered supernova. The extensive\nsearch, however, did not find the signature that accompanies such elements.\nThe origin of heavy elements in the universe continues to remain as one of\nastronomy's biggest open questions.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n\"When we confirmed that the GRB was generated by the collapse of a massive\nstar, that gave us the opportunity to test a hypothesis for how some of the\nheaviest elements in the universe are formed,\" said Northwestern's Peter\nBlanchard, who led the study.\n\n\"We did not see signatures of these heavy elements, suggesting that extremely\nenergetic GRBs like the B.O.A.T. do not produce these elements. That doesn't\nmean that all GRBs do not produce them, but it's a key piece of information as\nwe continue to understand where these heavy elements come from. Future\nobservations with JWST will determine if the B.O.A.T.'s 'normal' cousins\nproduce these elements.\"\n\n## Birth of the B.O.A.T.\n\nWhen its light washed over Earth on Oct. 9, 2022, the B.O.A.T. was so bright\nthat it saturated most of the world's gamma-ray detectors. The powerful\nexplosion occurred approximately 2.4 billion light-years away from Earth, in\nthe direction of the constellation Sagitta and lasted a few hundred seconds in\nduration. As astronomers scrambled to observe the origin of this incredibly\nbright phenomenon, they were immediately hit with a sense of awe.\n\n\"As long as we have been able to detect GRBs, there is no question that this\nGRB is the brightest we have ever witnessed by a factor of 10 or more,\" Wen-\nfai Fong, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern's\nWeinberg College of Arts and Sciences and member of CIERA, said at the time.\n\n\"The event produced some of the highest-energy photons ever recorded by\nsatellites designed to detect gamma rays,\" Blanchard said. \"This was an event\nthat Earth sees only once every 10,000 years. We are fortunate to live in a\ntime when we have the technology to detect these bursts happening across the\nuniverse. It's so exciting to observe such a rare astronomical phenomenon as\nthe B.O.A.T. and work to understand the physics behind this exceptional\nevent.\"\n\n## A 'normal' supernova\n\nRather than observe the event immediately, Blanchard, his close collaborator\nAshley Villar of Harvard University and their team wanted to view the GRB\nduring its later phases. About six months after the GRB was initially\ndetected, Blanchard used the JWST to examine its aftermath.\n\n\"The GRB was so bright that it obscured any potential supernova signature in\nthe first weeks and months after the burst,\" Blanchard said. \"At these times,\nthe so-called afterglow of the GRB was like the headlights of a car coming\nstraight at you, preventing you from seeing the car itself. So, we had to wait\nfor it to fade significantly to give us a chance of seeing the supernova.\"\n\nBlanchard used the JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph to observe the object's\nlight at infrared wavelengths. That's when he saw the characteristic signature\nof elements like calcium and oxygen typically found within a supernova.\nSurprisingly, it wasn't exceptionally bright\u2014like the incredibly bright GRB\nthat it accompanied.\n\n\"It's not any brighter than previous supernovae,\" Blanchard said. \"It looks\nfairly normal in the context of other supernovae associated with less\nenergetic GRBs. You might expect that the same collapsing star producing a\nvery energetic and bright GRB would also produce a very energetic and bright\nsupernova. But it turns out that's not the case. We have this extremely\nluminous GRB, but a normal supernova.\"\n\n## Missing: Heavy elements\n\nAfter confirming\u2014for the first time\u2014the presence of the supernova, Blanchard\nand his collaborators then searched for evidence of heavy elements within it.\nCurrently, astrophysicists have an incomplete picture of all the mechanisms in\nthe universe that can produce elements heavier than iron.\n\nThe primary mechanism for producing heavy elements, the rapid neutron capture\nprocess, requires a high concentration of neutrons. So far, astrophysicists\nhave only confirmed the production of heavy elements via this process in the\nmerger of two neutron stars, a collision detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2017.\n\nBut scientists say there must be other ways to produce these elusive\nmaterials. There are simply too many heavy elements in the universe and too\nfew neutron-star mergers.\n\n\"There is likely another source,\" Blanchard said. \"It takes a very long time\nfor binary neutron stars to merge. Two stars in a binary system first have to\nexplode to leave behind neutron stars. Then, it can take billions and billions\nof years for the two neutron stars to slowly get closer and closer and finally\nmerge.\n\n\"But observations of very old stars indicate that parts of the universe were\nenriched with heavy metals before most binary neutron stars would have had\ntime to merge. That's pointing us to an alternative channel.\"\n\nAstrophysicists have hypothesized that heavy elements also might be produced\nby the collapse of a rapidly spinning, massive star\u2014the exact type of star\nthat generated the B.O.A.T. Using the infrared spectrum obtained by the JWST,\nBlanchard studied the inner layers of the supernova, where the heavy elements\nshould be formed.\n\n\"The exploded material of the star is opaque at early times, so you can only\nsee the outer layers,\" Blanchard said. \"But once it expands and cools, it\nbecomes transparent. Then you can see the photons coming from the inner layer\nof the supernova.\"\n\n\"Moreover, different elements absorb and emit photons at different\nwavelengths, depending on their atomic structure, giving each element a unique\nspectral signature,\" Blanchard explained. \"Therefore, looking at an object's\nspectrum can tell us what elements are present. Upon examining the B.O.A.T.'s\nspectrum, we did not see any signature of heavy elements, suggesting extreme\nevents like GRB 221009A are not primary sources. This is crucial information\nas we continue to try to pin down where the heaviest elements are formed.\"\n\n## Why so bright?\n\nTo tease apart the light of the supernova from that of the bright afterglow\nthat came before it, the researchers paired the JWST data with observations\nfrom the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.\n\n\"Even several months after the burst was discovered, the afterglow was bright\nenough to contribute a lot of light in the JWST spectra,\" said Tanmoy Laskar,\nan assistant professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Utah and\na co-author on the study.\n\n\"Combining data from the two telescopes helped us measure exactly how bright\nthe afterglow was at the time of our JWST observations and allow us to\ncarefully extract the spectrum of the supernova.\"\n\nAlthough astrophysicists have yet to uncover how a \"normal\" supernova and a\nrecord-breaking GRB were produced by the same collapsed star, Laskar said it\nmight be related to the shape and structure of the relativistic jets. When\nrapidly spinning, massive stars collapse into black holes, they produce jets\nof material that launch at rates close to the speed of light. If these jets\nare narrow, they produce a more focused\u2014and brighter\u2014beam of light.\n\n\"It's like focusing a flashlight's beam into a narrow column, as opposed to a\nbroad beam that washes across a whole wall,\" Laskar said. \"In fact, this was\none of the narrowest jets seen for a gamma-ray burst so far, which gives us a\nhint as to why the afterglow appeared as bright as it did. There may be other\nfactors responsible as well, a question that researchers will be studying for\nyears to come.\"\n\nAdditional clues also may come from future studies of the galaxy in which the\nB.O.A.T. occurred. \"In addition to a spectrum of the B.O.A.T. itself, we also\nobtained a spectrum of its 'host' galaxy,\" Blanchard said. \"The spectrum shows\nsigns of intense star formation, hinting that the birth environment of the\noriginal star may be different than previous events.\"\n\nTeam member Yijia Li, a graduate student at Penn State, modeled the spectrum\nof the galaxy, finding that the B.O.A.T.'s host galaxy has the lowest\nmetallicity, a measure of the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and\nhelium, of all previous GRB host galaxies. \"This is another unique aspect of\nthe B.O.A.T. that may help explain its properties,\" Li said.\n\nThis work is based on observations made with the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space\nTelescope.\n\nBlanchard is a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA), where he studies superluminous supernovae and GRBs.
