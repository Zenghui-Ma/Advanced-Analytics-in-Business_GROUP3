Parks III, also known as\n\u201cCP3O,\u201d with operating a large-scale illegal \u201ccryptojacking\u201d operation. As\npart of the scheme, Parks defrauded two well-known providers of cloud\ncomputing services out of more than $3.5 million worth of computing resources\nin order to mine cryptocurrency worth nearly $1 million. Parks was charged\nwith wire fraud, money laundering and engaging in unlawful monetary\ntransactions in connection with the scheme. Parks was arrested on April 13,\n2024 in Nebraska and is scheduled to make his initial appearance in federal\ncourt in Omaha on April 16, 2024.\n\nBreon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York,\nJames Smith, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation,\nNew York Field Office (FBI), and Edward A. Caban, Commissioner, New York City\nPolice Department (NYPD) announced the arrest and charges.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, by hijacking cloud providers\u2019 computing power, Parks stole\nmillions worth of powerful computing resources to acquire cryptocurrency,\u201d\nstated United States Attorney Peace. \u201cThis Office will continue to prioritize\nprosecuting criminal actors who use new, sophisticated technology to engage in\nthe old scheme of fraud and deceit.\u201d\n\nMr. Peace expressed his appreciation to the FBI\u2019s New York Cyber Crimes Task\nForce (CCTF) and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of\nNebraska for their assistance on this case.\n\n\u201cCharles Parks, also known as CP3O, allegedly created a cryptojacking scheme\nto defraud prominent cloud service providers of millions and illegally mine\napproximately $1M in cryptocurrency for personal use. Criminals are becoming\nmore adept at manipulating digital tools and hiding behind advanced\ntechnology, which often causes significant financial damage to their victims.\nThe FBI is committed to the steadfast pursuit of those who attempt to develop\ninnovative techniques to commit crimes,\u201d stated FBI Assistant Director-in-\nCharge Smith.\n\n\u201cThis arrest illustrates the power of law enforcement joining forces with the\nprivate sector to identify and track down cybercriminals, and to put an end to\ntheir sophisticated thievery,\u201d stated NYPD Commissioner Caban. \u201cWhile the\nthreat landscape in this space is growing in complexity and depth, the NYPD\nand our federal partners continue to ably confront malicious actors even as\nthey adopt new tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cCryptojacking,\u201d also referred to as malicious cryptomining, is the\nunauthorized use or hijacking of another party\u2019s resources, such as\nelectricity, hardware or computing power to mine cryptocurrency. As alleged in\nthe indictment, from in or about January 2021 through August 2021, Parks\ncreated and used a variety of names, corporate affiliations and email\naddresses, including emails with domains from corporate entities he operated\ncalled \u201cMultiMillionaire LLC\u201d and \u201cCP3O LLC,\u201d to register numerous accounts\nwith the cloud providers and to gain access to massive amounts of computing\nprocessing power and storage that he did not pay for. Parks used those\nfraudulently obtained resources to mine various cryptocurrencies including\nEther (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Monero (XMR). Parks tricked the providers into\napproving heightened privileges and benefits, including elevated levels of\ncloud computing services and deferred billing accommodations, and deflected\ninquiries from the providers regarding questionable data usage and mounting\nunpaid subscription balances.\n\nParks converted and laundered the cryptocurrency proceeds through\ncryptocurrency exchanges, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, an online\npayment provider, and traditional bank accounts, in order to disguise the\naudit trail and disassociate the funds from the fraud. Parks also structured\nvarious money movements to avoid transaction reporting requirements under\nfederal law. After converting the ill-gotten cryptocurrency into dollars,\nParks used the proceeds of the scheme to make extravagant purchases, including\na Mercedes Benz luxury car, jewelry and first-class hotel and travel expenses.\n\nThe charges in the indictment are allegations, and Parks is presumed innocent\nunless and until proven guilty. If convicted, Parks faces a maximum sentence\nof 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on the wire fraud and money laundering charges and\n10 years\u2019 imprisonment on the unlawful monetary transactions charges.\n\nThe government\u2019s case is being handled by the Office\u2019s National Security and\nCybercrime Section. Assistant United States Attorneys Andrew Reich and Artie\nMcConnell are in charge of the prosecution.\n\nThe Defendant:\n\nCHARLES O.
