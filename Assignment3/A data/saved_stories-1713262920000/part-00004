When enough\nRivian drivers have used a given charging site, we dynamically assign that\nsite a reliability score from A (highest) to F (lowest) based on those\ncritical performance factors.\n\nDrag and drop to replace this photo\n\nYou can only add one photo\n\nBrowse\n\nFinish\n\nLink to story section\n\nChange text alignment\n\n1 Columns\n\n2 Columns\n\nDropcaps\n\nCenter align photo\n\nSmall Wide\n\nLeft align photo\n\nRight align photo\n\nTop Centered Bottom Sticky\n\nRemove group\n\nMove This Group Up Move This Group Down\n\n## Group Title (Optional)\n\nDrag and drop to replace this photo\n\nYou can only add one photo\n\nBrowse\n\nFinish\n\nReplace Photo\n\nUploading Photo\n\nLink to story section\n\nChange text alignment\n\n1 Columns\n\n2 Columns\n\nDropcaps\n\nInfo Box Call Out Style\n\nRemove group\n\nMove This Group Up Move This Group Down\n\n## Group Title (Optional)\n\nCharging scores are seamlessly integrated with our trip planner to give you a\nworry-free charging experience on long-distance trips.

To view your vehicle\u2019s max charging speed, tap the information icon [i]\nnext to the site charging speed. Some fast-charging sites have not been\nassigned a charging reliability score yet.

However, if your trip is way off the beaten path, you may see\nlower-scoring charging sites on your route if these are the best options\navailable.\n\nEnsure you have a valid form of payment. When you plug into the Rivian\nAdventure Network, a Tesla Supercharger and other charging networks with plug-\nand-charge compatibility, the credit card linked to your Rivian account is\nautomatically billed.\n\nSince ease of payment impacts charger reliability scores, charging networks\nthat don\u2019t yet offer plug-and-charge may have a lower score if drivers have\nhad payment troubles. Keep in mind that many fast-charging providers use their\nown apps to accept payments. So if you\u2019re planning an extended trip, consider\ndownloading apps for the networks you will use before you go.\n\nDrag and drop to replace this photo\n\nYou can only add one photo\n\nBrowse\n\nFinish\n\nLink to story section\n\nChange text alignment\n\n1 Columns\n\n2 Columns\n\nDropcaps\n\nFull width photo\n\nParallax scroll photo\n\nParallax scroll with text overlay\n\nDark Clear\n\nRemove group\n\nMove This Group Up Move This Group Down\n\n## Group Title (Optional)\n\nDrag and drop to replace this photo\n\nYou can only add one photo\n\nBrowse\n\nFinish\n\nReplace Photo\n\nUploading Photo\n\nLink to story section\n\nChange text alignment\n\n1 Columns\n\n2 Columns\n\nDropcaps\n\nInfo Box Call Out Style\n\nRemove group\n\nMove This Group Up Move This Group Down\n\n## Group Title (Optional)\n\nStart planning your Rivian road trip now.
