DOI:\n10.3389/feart.2024.1349425\n\nA trio of seismologists affiliated with Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e\nVulcanologia, the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, University of California,\nBerkeley reports that a part of the San Andreas Fault, at Parkfield, is not\nproducing signals that would suggest an earthquake is going to happen any time\nsoon, but they assert there are factors that suggest otherwise.\n\nThe paper, authored by Luca Malagnini, Robert Nadeau and Tom Parsons, is\npublished in the journal Frontiers in Earth Science\n\nThe part of the San Andreas Fault located near Parkfield, California, offers\nscientists who study earthquakes a unique opportunity: Just north of\nParkfield, two major plates creep against one another at a constant rate.\nSouth of Parkfield, on the other hand, the fault is locked. Because of this,\nearthquakes happen there in a pattern\u2014roughly every 22 years.\n\nThat allows researchers to gather seismic data before, during and after a\nquake. Such quakes are almost always the same magnitude as well, approximately\n6 or slightly higher. The last quake to happen at the site occurred in 2004,\nwhich suggests a quake should be coming in the next couple of years. But there\nis a problem\u2014seismic activity related to the fault does not indicate any signs\nof an earthquake. Usually, they note, low-frequency waves attenuate prior to a\nquake, while high-frequency waves increase. But there is no sign of either\nright now.\n\nThe research team notes that the last earthquake to occur in the area was\napproximately 14 years late. But that was because other earthquakes occurred\nin close enough proximity to take the pressure off Parkfield\u2014that is not the\ncase this time around. Still, the researchers believe a quake is going to\nhappen soon because of other factors.\n\nThese include pressure in nearby parts of the fault that could lead to an\nearthquake, but with a somewhat displaced epicenter.\n\nThe researchers do not have high confidence in their readings; thus, they are\nnot going to be making any formal predictions. Instead, they suggest, as is\nalways the case with earthquakes, everyone will just have to wait and see what\nhappens. In this case, though, waiting is not such a problem\u2014hardly anyone\nlives in the area.\n\nMore information: Luca Malagnini et al, Seismic attenuation and stress on the\nSan Andreas Fault at Parkfield: are we critical yet?, Frontiers in Earth\nScience (2024).
