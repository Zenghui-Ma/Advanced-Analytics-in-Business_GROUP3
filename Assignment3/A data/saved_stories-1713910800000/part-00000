Goods\nrepaired under the warranty will benefit from an additional one-year extension\nof the legal guarantee, further incentivising consumers to choose repair\ninstead of replacement.\n\nAfter the legal guarantee has expired, the manufacturer is still required to\nrepair common household products, which are technically repairable under EU\nlaw, such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and even smartphones. The list\nof product categories can be extended over time. Consumers may also borrow a\ndevice whilst theirs is being repaired or, if it cannot be fixed, opt for a\nrefurbished unit as an alternative.\n\nInformation on repair conditions and services\n\nA European information form can be offered to consumers to help them assess\nand compare repair services (detailing the nature of the defect, price and\nduration of the repair). To make the repair process easier, a European online\nplatform with national sections will be set up to help consumers easily find\nlocal repair shops, sellers of refurbished goods, buyers of defective items or\ncommunity-led repair initiatives, such as repair cafes.\n\nRevitalising the repair market\n\nThe rules aim to strengthen the EU repair market and reduce repair costs for\nconsumers. Manufacturers will have to provide spare parts and tools at a\nreasonable price and will be prohibited from using contractual clauses,\nhardware or software techniques that obstruct repairs. In particular, they\ncannot impede the use of second-hand or 3D-printed spare parts by independent\nrepairers, nor can they refuse to repair a product solely for economic reasons\nor because it was previously repaired by someone else.\n\nPromoting affordable repair\n\nTo make repairs more affordable, each member state will have to implement at\nleast one measure to promote repair, such as repair vouchers and funds,\nconducting information campaigns, offering repair courses or supporting for\ncommunity-led repair spaces.\n\nQuote\n\nRapporteur Ren\u00e9 Repasi (S&D, DE) said: \u201cConsumers\u2019 right to repair products\nwill now become a reality. It will be easier and cheaper to repair instead of\npurchase new, expensive items. This is a significant achievement for\nParliament and its commitment to empower consumers in the fight against\nclimate change. The new legislation extends legal guarantees by 12 months when\nopting for repair, gives better access to spare parts and ensures easier,\ncheaper and faster repair.\u201d\n\nNext steps\n\nOnce the directive is formally approved by Council and published in the EU\nOfficial Journal, member states will have 24 months to transpose it into\nnational law.\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the European Commission, the premature disposal of consumer goods\nproduces 261 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, consumes 30 million\ntonnes of resources, and generates 35 million tonnes of waste in the EU each\nyear. Consumers also lose about \u20ac12 billion yearly by replacing goods rather\nthan repairing them. Additionally, the new rules are expected to bring \u20ac4.8\nbillion in growth and investment within the EU. The directive complements\nother new EU rules on Ecodesign and on Empowering consumers for the green\ntransition.\n\nConference on the future of Europe\n\nThe legislation responds directly to citizens\u2019 demands, as expressed in the\nConference on the Future of Europe. More concretely, proposals 5(6), (7), (10)\nand 11(2) on sustainable consumption and sustainable growth and innovation -\nlaunching a \u201crepair\u201d platform; introducing measures to promote a right to\nrepair and access to spare parts; taking EU action to incentivise consumers to\nuse products for longer; and addressing planned obsolescence and ensuring the\nright to repair.\n\n##\n\nContacts:\n\n  * ### Yasmina YAKIMOVA\n\nPress Officer\n\nContact data:\n\n    * Phone number: (+32) 2 28 42626 (BXL)\n    * Mobile number: (+32) 470 88 10 60\n    * E-mail: yasmina.yakimova@europarl.europa.eu\n    * Twitter account: @EP_SingleMarket\n\n##\n\nFurther information\n\n  * Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection\n\n  * Procedure file\n\n  * Adopted text (23.04.2024)\n\n  * Video of the debate (22.03.2024)\n\n  * Press conference with the rapporteur after the final vote (23.04.2024)\n\n  * EP research service: Right to repair - Strengthened consumer rights\n\n  * EP multimedia: Circular economy\n\n##\n\nProduct information\n\nRef.: 20240419IPR20590\n\n##\n\nShare this page:\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * WhatsApp\n\nSign up for mail updates\n\nPDF version\n\n## News\n\n### Parliament in your country\n\n  * Open in a new page London\n  * Open in a new page Dublin\n  * Open in a new page Edinburgh\n  * Open in a new page Valletta\n  * Open in a new page Washington\n\n### Tools\n\n  * Open in a new page Legislative Observatory\n  * Open in a new page Multimedia Centre\n  * Open in a new page EbS\n\n### The President of the European Parliament\n\n  * Open in a new page European Parliament President\u2019s website\n\n## European Parliament\n\n  * Open in a new page News\n  * Topics\n  * Open in a new page MEPs\n  * Open in a new page About Parliament\n  * Open in a new page Plenary\n  * Open in a new page Committees\n  * Open in a new page Delegations\n  * Elections\n\n## The Parliament on social media\n\n  * Check out Parliament on Facebook\n  * Check out Parliament on Twitter\n  * Check out Parliament on Flickr\n  * Check out Parliament on LinkedIn\n  * Check out Parliament on YouTube\n  * Check out Parliament on Instagram\n  * Check out Parliament on Pinterest\n  * Check out Parliament on Snapchat\n  * Check out Parliament on Reddit\n\n## Information links\n\n  * Open in a new pageContact\n  * Open in a new pageRSS\n  * Open in a new pageSitemap\n  * Open in a new pageLegal notice\n  * Open in a new pagePrivacy policy\n  * Open in a new pageAccessibility\n\n", "frontpage": true}
