Much\nof the grid infrastructure is outdated, built to rely on electricity supplies\nfrom a few major energy hubs. However, as more green energy projects crop up\nin atypical locations \u2013 such as rural regions and offshore sites \u2013 it is\nbecoming increasingly difficult to ensure that energy will reach the grid for\ndistribution. Many energy experts believe it will take a complete overhaul to\nprepare the grid for the rapid growth of the country\u2019s renewable energy\ncapacity. Yet, some believe it may be possible to roll out a rarely used\ntechnique to upgrade old power lines across the U.S.\n\nBuilding new power lines often takes a decade or longer due to red tape and\nother restrictions. However, some experts believe it may be possible to\nimprove the U.S. grid much faster by using a method that is widely used in\nseveral other countries around the globe. Two reports released this month\nsuggest that replacing existing power lines with cables made from state-of-\nthe-art materials could potentially double the capacity of the grid across\nmany parts of the U.S., allowing more renewable energy projects to be\nconnected.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe technique, \u2018advanced reconductoring\u2019, would replace the traditional\napproach to transmission line construction. Most of the powerlines in the U.S.\nare made up of steel cores coated in strands of aluminium, as electricity\ncompanies continue to use the century-old, tried-and-tested design. However,\nsome companies have developed innovative cables, which use smaller and lighter\ncores, such as carbon fibre, that have a greater energy transport capacity\nthan aluminium. While the technology is available in the U.S., many major\ncompanies have been reluctant to make the switch due to their unfamiliarity\nwith the materials, as well as the fear of regulatory and bureaucratic\nlimitations.\n\nMost importantly, replacing old transmission lines can be done quickly and\nprevents the need for regulatory approval for new power infrastructure. The\ntechnique is also significantly cheaper than a total infrastructure overhaul,\ncosting around half the price of constructing new lines. The reports suggested\nthat if utilities started replacing the thousands of miles of power lines they\ncould add four times as much transmission capacity by 2035 as they are\ncurrently on pace to do. Amol Phadke, a senior scientist at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley and contributor to the report, stated \u201cWe were pretty\nastonished by how big of an increase in capacity you can get by\nreconductoring.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome companies have already begun to replace old powerlines with new, higher-\ncapacity lines. In Nevada, NV Energy installed 125 miles of advanced\nconductors across 25 lines, with a further 18 projects to follow. The project\nis expected to reduce wildfire risks, cut costs, and double capacity along its\nBig Creek transmission corridor. Meanwhile, in 2005, Minnesota-based Excel\nEnergy added new lines using the reconductoring technique in Minneapolis-St,\ndoubling the capacity. Project approval was granted in 30 days and the project\nwas completed in just eight weeks.\n\nSeveral energy companies across the U.S. have been complaining about their\ninability to connect projects to the grid due to infrastructure limitations.\nWhile the government and National Grid are investing in improvements, they\ncannot keep up with the speed at which new green energy projects are being\ndeveloped, particularly following the introduction of the Inflation Reduction\nAct (IRA) climate policy in 2022. Other companies are reluctant to develop\nprojects without the assurance that adequate infrastructure will be in place\nwhen they become operational.\n\nThe use of innovative cable materials will not completely solve the\ntransmission problem, as many renewable energy projects are located in\nunconventional energy production areas, too far from the existing grid\ninfrastructure to be connected. The Department of Energy predicts that the\nU.S. transmission lines network will need to expand by two-thirds or more by\n2035 to achieve President Biden\u2019s goals of powering the country with clean\nenergy. Nevertheless, it could significantly increase the capacity of the\nexisting infrastructure to ensure that investments in green energy projects\nare not wasted, as suppliers wait to be connected, and that more energy can be\ndistributed countrywide as the U.S. energy demand grows.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, to roll out the advanced reconductoring technique countrywide,\nutilities must get regulators on board. Regulators are often wary of approving\nnew technologies where there are tried-and-tested alternatives. In addition,\nas the wires are more expensive than those currently being used, they may be\nsceptical of investing money in the technique. Further, due to the uncertainty\naround the level of growing energy demand in various parts of the U.S.,\nseveral regulators may see the high cost of \u201cfutureproofing\u201d the grid as a\nrisky move.\n\nBy Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * U.S. Oil and Gas Boom Poses Challenge to Climate Goals\n  * Turkey Aims to Triple Middle Corridor Trade by 2030\n  * Triple Junction Solar Cell Sets World Record Efficiency\n\n##### Download The Free Oilprice App Today\n\nBack to homepage\n\n### Around the Web\n\n#### Diese Einfache L\u00f6sung Beendet Jahrzehntelanges Bauchfett\n\nGewichtsverlust\n\n#### Die Ungl\u00fccklichsten Sternzeichen\n\nwww.stylevamp.de\n\n#### Studying Supply Chain Management in the USA is Easier Than You Think\n\nIslalending\n\n#### Top 50 Amazing Beaches in the World\n\nbakeinto\n\n#### This Video Will Soon Be Banned.
