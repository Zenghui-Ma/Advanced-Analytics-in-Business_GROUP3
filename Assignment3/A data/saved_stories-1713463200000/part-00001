Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Why do we lose so much hair?\n\nNews\n\nBy Marlowe Starling\n\npublished yesterday\n\nHair shedding is normal, but when is it considered \"hair loss\"?\n\nPeople lose between 50 and 100 strands of hair, on average, every day.

In a matter of weeks to months, a\nperson can go from having a head full of luscious locks to a brush full of\nfallen strands.\n\nA certain amount of hair shedding is normal; we lose an average of 50 to 100\nstrands of hair each day, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.\nBut when is it considered abnormal? And what are some reasons for increased\nrates of hair loss?\n\nBefore diving into these questions, it's important to understand the hair\ncycle. Hair grows in four stages: anagen, when hair is actively growing;\ncatagen, right before hair growth stops; telogen, when hair stops growing; and\nexogen, when hair sheds from the follicle. The anagen phase can last anywhere\nfrom two to eight years, catagen for a brief two weeks, and telogen for about\nthree months before the strand sheds.\n\nIn an average person's lifetime, each hair follicle will undergo this cycle 10\nto 30 times. As a person ages, the anagen or growth phase becomes shorter, and\nfewer hair follicles stay in the anagen phase.\n\nMoreover, not all shedding is true hair loss. \"A lot of times, hair loss is\nreally hair breakage,\" Dr. Lynn McKinley-Grant, an associate professor of\ndermatology at Howard University College of Medicine, told Live Science.\nBreakage can happen from brushing hair too much or using hair styles that pull\non the scalp, like weaves and tight braids. It can also happen from using\nharsh products or certain styling routines, McKinley-Grant said.\n\nBut shedding more hair than what grows back can be a sign of alopecia, the\nmedical term for hair loss. There are many different types, ranging from\nhormone-induced hair loss to autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe list of potential causes is \"enormous,\" Dr. Dan Baumgardt, an anatomist\nand primary care physician at the University of Bristol in the U.K. who\nadvises patients on hair loss, told Live Science.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRelated: Why don't overplucked eyebrows fully grow back?\n\nDiet, extreme physical or emotional stress, hormonal changes, autoimmune\ndisorders, certain medications and scalp health can all affect the amount and\ntype of hair loss. Often, more than one of these factors are at play. In a\ntype of alopecia called telogen effluvium, some hair very suddenly sheds\nacross the entire scalp. Major surgeries, bad cases of the flu or COVID-19,\nchemotherapy, diabetes, anemia, thyroid disorders, hormone fluctuations, and a\nslew of other health conditions can trigger this type of hair loss. Hormonal\nchanges during pregnancy can pause the shedding phase but then trigger telogen\neffluvium during the postpartum period.\n\nWith a limited amount of available energy at any given time, the body may stop\nhair from growing so it can spend energy elsewhere when we are sick or\notherwise stressed, McKinley-Grant said. It's usually not until three to six\nmonths later, after more hair from the resting telogen phase has fallen out,\nthat people tend to notice it. Most of the time, this hair will grow back, she\nsaid.\n\nOther common forms of alopecia are male- and female-pattern hair loss. The\nformer is characterized by a receding hairline, and the latter by overall\nthinning and a widening hair part. Both men and women can have either of these\nhair-loss patterns, depending on the levels of certain hormones.\n\nScalp health can also affect how much hair we shed. Scalp inflammation, such\nas that caused by psoriasis, can stop hair from growing, but it can be\ntreated, McKinley-Grant said. Lesser known conditions like seborrheic\ndermatitis, a type of fungal disease, can cause inflammation, too. Because\nthis makes the scalp itchy, a person's scratching can damage hair follicles.\n\nPeople with longer hair might notice more hair shedding than people with\nshorter hair \u2014 for example, on hairbrushes \u2014 simply because it's easier to\nsee. But noticing a thinner ponytail, round bald patches, or a receding\nhairline can be reasons to see a doctor, McKinley-Grant added.\n\nRELATED MYSTERIES\n\n\u2014Why do men's eyebrows get bushier with age?\n\n\u2014Why do babies lose their hair?\n\n\u2014Why does hair turn gray?\n\n\"Skin, hair and nails really reflect your overall health,\" McKinley-Grant\nsaid, making dermatologists well positioned to help identify underlying health\nconditions such as heart and liver problems, anemia and joint inflammation.\n\"Skin is the largest organ of the body, so the blood goes through all the\norgans and stuff lands up in the skin.\" In this sense, hair health can be a\nhelpful indicator of overall health for practitioners.\n\nThere are plenty of products marketed on social media for hair growth, but\nit's important to talk to a doctor first. Oftentimes, those brands tout\nresults based on faulty methods, Baumgardt said, such as using patient surveys\nrather than actual science. \"I wouldn't do any of them until you talk to a\ndermatologist,\" McKinley-Grant added.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer\nmedical advice.\n\nMarlowe Starling\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nMarlowe Starling is a freelance environmental journalist who reports on\nclimate, conservation, water, wildlife and culture.
