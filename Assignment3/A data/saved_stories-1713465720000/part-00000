For this effort, they are paid in bitcoin (BTC) at a current\nrate of 6.25 BTC per block verified, along with transaction fees. It takes\nabout 10 minutes to verify a new block, and there are roughly 144 blocks\nverified every day, which equates to rewards of 900 BTC each day. Thus, the\nsupply of BTC increases by this amount daily.\n\nFor every 210,000 blocks mined, the mining rewards available are reduced or\nhalved. This occurs approximately every four years. After this upcoming\nhalving, the fourth in the blockchain's 15-year history, a miner will receive\n3.125 BTC for verifying a block, instead of 6.25 BTC. This will reduce the new\nBTC daily supply to about 450 BTC.\n\nWhat is the current market status?\n\nThe daily exchange-traded volume of BTC varies depending on the source, but\nlooking at the Messari volumes, we see a daily volume range of around $30\nbillion. At current prices (BTC = $64,000), the reduced new supply will equal\n$29 million or roughly 1% of the average daily exchange traded volume, down\nfrom 2%.\n\nMiners, however, may not sell all their new coins. Research from CoinShares\nsuggests that the average cost of mining a bitcoin after the halving will be\naround $40,000, depending on many variables. So, miners whose operational\ncosts are less than the current market rate may choose to hold their coin and\nnot bring it to market. However, this was always the case. You have some\nminers that sell all the rewarded BTC when they get it (either to take profit,\ncover operational costs or for capital investment) and others who hold excess\nBitcoin in the expectation of price appreciation.\n\nAnother consideration is the \"free float\" (coins actively trading) in BTC.\nCurrently, circa 93.5% or 19.635 million of all BTC have been mined. Of that,\nabout 75% are considered to be held long-term (where BTC has been sitting in a\nwallet for longer than 155 days). This would leave a free float of ~5 million\nBTC, increasing the supply by 0.01% daily.\n\nAlso to consider are the new spot bitcoin ETFs. The average daily inflow\nvolume into the new ETFs (including grayscale outflows) is $202 million. This\nis far more influential on prices than the reduction in supply.\n\nWhat could this mean for the price of bitcoin?\n\nWhilst it is obvious that a decrease in the supply should be net positive for\nthe price of any commodity, this should also be true for bitcoin. The question\nis, how much should it increase and has the increase in price already been\nbuilt into the current price? As we have seen with the ETF announcements, most\npre-determined headlines become \"Buy the rumour, sell the fact\" events, and we\nsee a risk of that here too.\n\nWe don\u2019t find value in looking back on previous halvings, as there are not\nenough data points to be statistically meaningful. Additionally, trying to\nextrapolate correlations to halvings in an instrument that has gone up from $0\nto $70,000 in a short period of time is difficult.\n\nA much larger influence on the price of bitcoin will be the ETF flows, as\nthese have the potential to change depending on sentiment dramatically. These\nflows can easily outstrip the reduction in supply from the halving.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nWe see the halving making a much larger impact on miners than the bitcoin\nprice. Miners will have to adjust their operations to accommodate the smaller\nrewards they will get, whether that is by capital expenditure on more\nefficient equipment, cutting operational costs, or, indeed, selling more of\ntheir mined bitcoin.\n\nOne of the goals for participants in the digital asset space is to increase\ninstitutional adoption. Reducing the daily new supply by $31.5 million in a\nmarket that already transacts approximately $30 billion is relatively trivial.\nIf the market cannot handle a reduction of $31.5 million daily supply, then it\nis not ready for institutions.\n\nLook out for the ETF flows; they will dictate the price more so than a small\ndecrease in supply growth.\n\n\\- Mick Roche, senior trader, Zodia Markets\n\n## Ask an Expert\n\nQ. How does the bitcoin halving affect the supply of bitcoin, and what impact\ndoes this have on its price?\n\nThe supply of bitcoin in the secondary market depends on holders looking to\nsell existing bitcoin and miners looking to sell the newly minted bitcoin they\nare awarded. Generally, in between halvings, the release of these new bitcoins\ncreates a kind of equilibrium in the supply/demand dynamic of the secondary\nmarket where the reward can support the demand. When the halving occurs it\ncreates a supply shock as the equilibrium is disturbed and no longer meets\ndemand. Historically this has been a catalyst for the price to increase\ndramatically.\n\nQ. Can you explain the concept of \"halving cycles\" in the context of Bitcoin's\nprice history?\n\nSince the halving is programmed to occur every 210,000 blocks, it creates a\ndistinct time frame between these events that lasts about four years. In these\nfour years, there has historically been a peak price, a trough price, a bull\nportion of the cycle, and a bear portion of the cycle. The most price\nappreciation has historically been in the month preceding and following the\nhalving. This is a result of the supply shock that the halving creates. After\nthe new supply/demand equilibrium is reached, the price peaks and then a\ndrastic sell-off occurs until the BTC price finds its bottom or trough. This\nis usually 12-18 months after the halving. Once we get to the bottom, the\nprice chops around, then steadily rises until we get close to the halving, and\nthe cycle repeats.\n\nQ. What are some potential strategies for investors to consider before,\nduring, and after a Bitcoin halving event?\n\nThe main strategy we recommend to an investor with a long time horizon is just\nto buy and hold. Crypto volatility can be hard to manage, and it\u2019s easy to get\ncaught on the wrong side of a trade. That tends to lead to very emotional and\nsub-optimal decision-making. Over a multi-year timeframe, Bitcoin has tended\nto provide a great return to investors, so trying to improve on an already\ngreat return isn\u2019t necessary to make a strategy successful.\n\n\\- Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM\n\n## Keep Reading\n\n  * Bitcoin and ether ETFs received the green light Monday in Hong Kong and are expected to begin trading at the end of April.\n  * You can watch the bitcoin halving countdown live, thanks to the transparency of blockchain.\n  * The halving explained, a deeper read including more details on the bitcoin 21 million supply cap is available here.\n\n]]>\n\n<![CDATA[Bitcoin Halving Partially Priced In With No Big Rally Expected\nAfterward: Deutsche Bank]]>\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/18/bitcoin-halving-partially-priced-\nin-with-no-big-rally-expected-afterward-deutsche-\nbank/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahooIZXLMCMPXRHT7FHWU44FXX5AAEThu,\n18 Apr 2024 15:43:22 +00002024-04-18T15:46:18.345+00:00\n\n* The bitcoin halving is already partially priced in, the report said.\n* Deutsche Bank said it does not expect a large rally after the event.\n* The geography of crypto miners is expected to shift following the halving to countries with lower energy costs, the bank said.\n\nThe bitcoin {{BTC}} reward halving, expected in the next couple of days, has\nalready been partially priced in by the market and a large rally in the\ncryptocurrency is unlikely after it occurs, Deutsche Bank (DB) said in a\nresearch report on Thursday.\n\nThe quadrennial reward halving slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply and\nis expected to occur around April 19-20.\n\nBitcoin has climbed 44% year-to-date, CoinDesk Indices data show, more than\ndouble the gain of the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto\nmarket. The cryptocurrency\u2019s outperformance was driven mainly by the launch of\nspot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January.\n\nThe positive performance of bitcoin cash {{BCH}} following its own halving\nevent bodes well for the main Bitcoin network, the report said. Bitcoin Cash\nis a hard fork that split from the main Bitcoin network in August 2017. A fork\nis a modification to the original blockchain\u2019s code.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we continue to expect prices to stay high due to expectations\nof future spot ether (ETH) ETF approvals; future central bank rate cuts; and\nregulatory changes,\u201d analysts Marion Laboure and Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace\nwrote.\n\n\u201cAdding to that, a surge in layer 2 solutions and decentralized finance (DeFi)\nactivity, which augment the network\u2019s practical utility, and the setup begins\nto look remarkably favorable for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the wider crypto\nspace,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nDeutsche Bank said it expects the geography of crypto mining to shift\nfollowing the halving, as lower block rewards mean less profit, compelling\nminers to seek cheaper forms of energy.\n\n\u201cLatin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East have caught the attention of\ncrypto miners due to their lower energy costs,\u201d the report added.\n\nThe bank notes that previous halving events have driven cryptocurrency\nadoption, and more specifically retail adoption, as measured by the number of\nactive bitcoin addresses.\n\n\u201cIn the first 150 days after each previous halving event, the number of retail\naddresses grew by 52% in 2012, 37% in 2016 and 3% in 2020.\u201d\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Likely to Drop After the Halving, JPMorgan Says\n\n]]>\n\n<![CDATA[Protecting Crypto Users Is More Important Than Faster UK\nRegistration: FCA Executive ]]>\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/18/protecting-crypto-users-is-more-\nimportant-than-faster-uk-registration-fca-\nexecutive/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahooZOAU2HUK2JASDMYX7P5N2MSEBUThu,\n18 Apr 2024 15:00:54 +00002024-04-18T15:03:34.052+00:00\n\n* The U.K.'s FCA says it will prioritize trust over speed when it comes to crypto registrations.\n* The industry have said the FCA takes too long to approve crypto applications. The regulator has only approved 45 firms in four years.\n\nThe U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) won't compromise a focus on trust\njust to more quickly register crypto companies, an executive from the national\nregulator said Thursday.\n\n\"A simple focus on numbers could undermine trust and reputation,\" said Sarah\nPritchard, the FCA's executive director for markets and international at\nTheCityUK conference, in response to industry complaints that the regulator\ntakes far too long to register crypto companies.\n\nThe FCA, which is the country's main crypto regulator, has been processing\nregistrations for crypto firms wishing to operate in the country and comply\nwith its money laundering rules since 2020.

But the process\ncan take a while.\n\nParticipants in the crypto industry told CoinDesk last year that it took over\na year for the FCA to get back to them regarding their registration\napplication. In her remarks Thursday, Pritchard said speeding up its process\nmay look better, but could ultimately harm consumers.\n\n\"Lower standards could leave open our market to abuse by those who seek to\nlaunder criminally made cash, damaging market integrity and confidence in\nfinancial markets,\" Pritchard said. \"Instead, we take a longer view.

For example, tokenization\nallows large assets such as private equity or real estate to be broken down\nand represented by multiple tokens, opening the market to a wider range of\ninvestors, a previous report from the ratings company said.\n\nWhile financial institutions and governments have started dabbling in the\nissuance of tokenized assets \u2013 such as Hong Kong's $100 million green bond\nlast year \u2013 there is a lack of secondary markets where they can be traded\nafter the primary offering, the Moody's analysts note.\n\nThis limits the adoption of tokenization, the new report said, adding that\nthere is a noticeable growth in blockchain-powered secondary markets.\n\nBlockchain and tokenization bring \"significant innovations to secondary market\nstructures,\" and developing secondary markets for blockchain-based securities\ncould improve liquidity management, enhance market data accessibility and\nfacilitate instantaneous settlements, the report said.\n\n\"These blockchain-powered secondary markets address several perceived\ndrawbacks of traditional secondary markets, including limited accessibility of\ncertain asset classes, inefficiencies in settlement processes, and high\noperational costs,\" the report said.\n\nThough these blockchain markets promise innovation, the report warns that\nthere are also technological and regulatory hurdles.\n\n\"The technology underpinning these markets, primarily smart contracts, is\nsusceptible to risks such as bugs, rug pulls, price manipulations, and oracle\nfailures. These vulnerabilities not only pose financial risks to participants\nbut also hinder the broader acceptance and integration of [decentralized\nfinance],\" the report said.\n\n]]>\n\n<![CDATA[First Mover Americas: BTC Dominance Increases, Binance to Re-Enter\nIndia]]>\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/18/first-mover-americas-btc-\ndominance-increases-binance-to-re-enter-\nindia/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahooX2TG6H3YO5HUHECPDHHK5433Y4Thu,\n18 Apr 2024 12:18:16 +00002024-04-18T12:20:45.522+00:00This article originally\nappeared in First Mover, CoinDesk\u2019s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves\nin crypto markets in context.

The largest\ncryptocurrency by market value was trading below $61,400 during Asian hours on\nThursday, according to CoinDesk Indices data, as the sell-off in risk assets,\nfueled by difficult macroeconomic conditions, raged. The CoinDesk 20, a\nmeasure of the world\u2019s most liquid digital assets, fell 3.3% to 2,125. While\nbitcoin might be having a challenging moment, layer-1 blockchains and altcoins\nare doing worse. Top layer-1 tokens like Solana\u2019s (SOL) are down over 20% in\nthe past week. Avalanche's (AVAX) has fallen 26%, Cardano's (ADA) 23% and\nFilecoin (FIL) 30%.\n\nBinance, the cryptocurrency exchange that was removed from India some months\nago, is looking to re-enter the country by paying a $2 million fine, the\nEconomic Times reported on Thursday. Earlier this year, Binance and some other\nexchanges were removed from the Apple Store in India after India\u2019s Financial\nIntelligence Unit (FIU) sent them compliance \"show cause\" notices. OKX,\nKuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and Bitfinex\nwere the other firms that were sent notices at the time.\n\nUSDe holders should monitor the project\u2019s reserve fund to avoid risks related\nto the potential of a negative funding rate, according to data provider\nCryptoQuant. Ethena Labs, the firm behind the stablecoin, currently offers an\nannual yield of 17.2%, a rolling average over the past seven days, to\ninvestors that stake USDe or other stablecoins on the platform. The yield is\ncreated from a tokenized \u201ccash and carry\u201d trade that involves purchasing an\nasset whilst simultaneously shorting that asset to rake in funding payments.\nFunding is a way of keeping the asset prices on derivatives exchanges close to\nthe underlying assets.

Financial technology companies \u2013 fintechs \u2013 such as\nRevolut and Robinhood (HOOD) provide the distribution frameworks for the\ndigitization of financial services. But they still rely on TradFi as the\nmanufacturer, Frambot said.\n\nThat will change, he said, and points to several pieces of evidence for his\nthesis that DeFi will scale through a combination of centralized crypto\nexchanges and fintech firms.\n\nFor instance, many fintechs and exchanges have noted the success U.S.-listed\ncrypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) has had so far with Base, its layer-2\nblockchain, and decided to build or partner with layer 2s themselves, Frambot\nsaid. Robinhood in February announced it was working with layer-2 blockchain\nArbitrum, and many other fintech firms now have in place wallet infrastructure\nto seamlessly connect with Web3.\n\n\u201cTradFi has very little interest in moving to DeFi, to be frank, just because\nthey have such an unfair advantage with their current infrastructure,\u201d Frambot\nsaid in an interview. \u201cHowever, fintechs don't have their own financial\ninfrastructure, they have to go through all the fees of the TradFi guys. But\nthey have distribution, they have adoption. So if they start owning their own\ninfrastructure by building on top of layer-2s and immutable DeFi, then they\ncan start generating more profits from it, gain efficiency and limit their\noperating costs.\u201d\n\n\"I'm still frustrated that we're not changing finance at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're\nstill playing for crypto users that already have crypto. The promise of the\nopen financial infrastructure underpinning every financial service is miles\nand miles away from where we are right now. And I think because there is so\nmuch money to make from just the crypto game, there are few incentives for\nfounders to think beyond this.\u201d\n\nThe answer to DeFi\u2019s scaling problems also involves protocols that are\nneutral, like the rails of the internet itself, which can easily be built on\ntop of, Frambot said. Having started out as a very successful optimization\nservice on top of DiFi giants like Aave, using a matching engine to reduce\nspreads and offer users better interest rates, Morpho later transitioned to\nbecome a base-level protocol, more like Uniswap, the largest decentralized\nexchange by trading volume on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe model of a broker or fund that exists on-chain, like Aave or Compound,\nthat is necessarily mutable and continually subject to hundreds of risk-\nmanagement governance decisions will not scale to the degree required to make\nDeFi mainstream, in Frambot\u2019s opinion.\n\n\u201cWe can't have [a] one-size-fits-all monolith that meets all the different\ncompliance needs of the world,\u201d Frambot said. \u201cPeople want different [know\nyour customer] or risk. So you have to have the core protocol that is\ncompletely un-opinionated, and people build specific financial products on top\nfor their specific use cases.\u201d\n\n]]>\n\n<![CDATA[Tether Reorganizes Into 4 Divisions as It Expands Beyond\nStablecoins]]>\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/04/18/tether-reorganizes-\ninto-4-divisions-as-it-expands-beyond-\nstablecoins/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahooZPAU5G5PUBDGJPMU4VMTTDMFQAThu,\n18 Apr 2024 11:15:53 +00002024-04-18T12:03:14.623+00:00\n\n* The issuer of the largest stablecoin by market cap said the Data, Finance, Power and Edu divisions reflect its broadened mission.\n* The company has already invested in several areas outside USDT.\n\nTether, the developer of the world's largest stablecoin, said it is\nreorganizing to reflect its expansion into other areas of digital assets.\n\nThe company formed four divisions to reflect its broadening focus: Data will\nhandle strategic investment in technology including artificial intelligence\n(AI); Finance will cover the USDT stablecoin, which has a market cap in excess\nof $100 billion and plays a pivotal role in crypto markets; Power becomes the\numbrella for investments in bitcoin {{BTC}} mining and Edu is the home for\neducational activities.\n\n\"Tether\u2019s expansion beyond its well-established USDT stablecoin signifies a\nparadigm shift in its approach to financial empowerment,\" the company said in\na statement. \"By focusing on sustainable solutions adaptive to the needs of\nindividuals, communities, cities and countries, responsible Bitcoin mining,\nArtificial Intelligence infrastructure and decentralised communication\nplatforms, Tether is actively contributing to a future-proof financial and\ntech ecosystem.\"\n\nWhile the 10-year-old company is already active in these areas, the\nestablishment of distinct divisions reflects the growing importance it\nattaches to interests beyond its flagship stablecoin.

His mother and two other family\nmembers were in the gallery during the proceedings. Though his attorneys\nsuggested he may testify earlier in the trial, his defense ultimately rested\nwithout calling him to the stand.\n\nThe defense\u2019s case on Monday and Tuesday largely hinged on a single expert\nwitness, former Secret Service agent-turned crypto investigations consultant\nJeremy Sheridan. Over two days of testimony he spoke to the mechanisms that\nenabled Eisenberg\u2019s trades and the difficulty of understanding whether his\nborrows were, according to Mango Markets\u2019 codebase, actually borrows at all.\nBut much of his testimony got thrown out by the judge after the court\ndetermined his knowledge of Mango Markets\u2019 codebase was itself insufficient.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Eisenberg engaged in market manipulation, trading\nlarge sums of MNGO perpetual futures contracts between himself to pump the\nprice over 1000%, then using his newly-created collateral to fool the platform\ninto allowing him drain $110 million in various cryptocurrencies via the\nplatform\u2019s \u201cborrow\u201d function.\n\nBut Eisenberg wasn\u2019t borrowing, prosecutors told the jury on Wednesday \u2013 he\nwas stealing. Hours after the exploit, he issued an \u201cextortionate\u201d anonymous\nproposal to the Mango Markets decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\noffering to return $67 million of his haul in exchange for promises not to\npursue criminal charges or freeze the rest of the stolen funds.\n\nThe facts of the case were largely undisputed by Eisenberg\u2019s defense team when\nthey took the stand. Instead, Eisenberg\u2019s lead attorney, Brian Klein,\nattempted to frame Eisenberg\u2019s massive trades as a \u201csuccessful and legal\ntrading strategy\u201d that \u201cfully complied\u201d with the Mango Markets protocol. Klein\npointed to Mango Markets\u2019 lack of Terms of Use \u2013 only a checkbox that told\nvisitors to use the site \u201cat your own risk\u201d \u2013 at the time of Eisenberg\u2019s\nexploit, arguing that he simply used the platform as intended and made a lot\nof money doing it.\n\n\u201cThis is how people do things in this world of crypto,\u201d Klein told the jury.\n\nKlein is a well-known defense attorney in the crypto sphere, whose past\nclients include Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem and Virgil Griffith. Klein is\nalso currently representing Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm.\n\nProsecutors told the jury a different version of the story. Eisenberg, they\nsaid, knew what he was doing was illegal.\n\nBefore his exploit, Eisenberg had sued someone else in federal court for\nmanipulating the price of WAVES. He\u2019d also made internet searches for things\nlike \u201cstatute of limitations market manipulation\u201d and \u201celements of fraud\u201d\nbefore his October 2022 trades. After the trades \u2013 and once his identity as\nthe exploiter had been exposed \u2013 Eisenberg bought a ticket for a flight to\nIsrael and searched for \u201cFBI surveillance,\u201d \u201clist of Israel extraditions\u201d and\n\u201cOtisville prison,\u201d a white-collar federal penitentiary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you think you\u2019ve committed a crime,\u201d the prosecutor\ntold the jury.\n\nKlein told the jury Eisenberg didn\u2019t go to Israel to escape charges, but\ninstead because angry Mango Markets\u2019 users were threatening his safety. Klein\nalso said that the fact that Eisenberg sued both Circle and AscendX, a\nnominally Romanian exchange, to get his money back once it was frozen \u2013 as\nwell as his willing return to the U.S. \u2013 was further evidence that he did not\nbelieve he had committed a crime.\n\nIn their rebuttal, prosecutors said that Eisenberg\u2019s legal attempts to get his\nmoney were made after his identity as the exploiter had been exposed. He\nthought that his proposal to Mango Markets\u2019 DAO, and its subsequent \u201cwaiver of\nliability,\u201d meant he was off the hook, emboldening him to come back to the\nU.S., they said.\n\n\u201cManipulation, lies, deceit \u2013 it\u2019s criminal, whether it happens on Wall Street\nor on a computer program,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nEisenberg faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all three counts.\n\n]]>\n\n<![CDATA[The Protocol: Bitcoin Halving Spectacular, With Runes, 'Epic Sat,'\nStacks Nakamoto]]>\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/17/the-protocol-bitcoin-halving-\nspectacular-with-runes-epic-sat-stacks-\nnakamoto/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahooEI44IG2HJJFTDHKY5P3AFOCOQMWed,\n17 Apr 2024 18:49:35 +00002024-04-17T18:54:27.412+00:00It's hard not to draw\nparallels between the general mood across parts of the planet last week, when\npeople were jockeying to glimpse the solar eclipse, and the excitement\nbuilding this week in the Bitcoin community, as the blockchain's quadrennial\nhalving approaches. Based on the latest estimates, the halving would arrive\nsometime in the next few days, possibly on the very meme-y date of April 20.\nThat's according to the Bitcoin halving countdown clock, on the website of the\nhashrate marketplace NiceHash.\n\nConversely, it's hard not to draw a sharp contrast between this Bitcoin\nhalving and the one that took place four years ago, in May 2020, just as the\nCovid lockdowns were hitting and people were stuck at home with little else to\ndo but stay up late for the livestreamed geek-outs. (Remember when Zoom was\njust becoming a household word?) This time around, IRL halving celebrations\nare planned in places like Denver and Costa Rica.\n\nAnother aspect that feels quite different: the host of project launches and\nstrangely lucrative on-chain competitions timed to take place right at the\nmoment of the halving \u2013 to some degree a reflection of the \"building-on-\nBitcoin\" trend sparked by last year's release of the Ordinals protocol and\nunveiling of Robin Linus's BitVM.

The move inspired a few columns on Monday, including\ninsightful ones from Fortune\u2019s Jeff John Roberts, which put it in context of\ngold\u2019s 17% rally, and Blockwork\u2019s Casey Wagner, who looked at how gas prices\ntend to move during crises in the Middle East.\n\nRead more from CoinDesk\u2019s \u201cFuture of Bitcoin\u201d package. This is an excerpt from\nThe Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on\nCoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true that there were more buyers than sellers of oil and gold\nfollowing the attack and more sellers than buyers of bitcoin \u2014 thus the former\nrose in value while the later dropped. But I\u2019ve always been of the view that\nintraday price movements for an asset as volatile as bitcoin say very little.\nThe bad news is: gold is continuing to rise (like it did after the collapse of\nLehman Brothers), while after a little pop on Sunday, bitcoin has been sagging\nlower and lower this week into the low $60K range.\n\nWhile the looming threat of WWIII may be putting a damper on bitcoin, it\u2019s\nlikely inklings emanating out from the Federal Reserve that it may hold\ninterest rates higher for longer than anticipated because the economy is doing\nwell that the market is responding to. Still, to raise the question of whether\nbitcoin is really a hedge \u2014 when in recent years it has clearly been behaving\nmore and more like a tech stock \u2014 seems like the wrong thing to ask.\n\nBitcoin was largely uncorrelated with the S&P 500 before the pandemic, so\nclearly it can act as a countercyclical asset. The question is: What changed\nfrom then to now? Also, what exactly is bitcoin meant to hedge? Stocks?\nInflation? U.S. Treasuries? Political turmoil? Is bitcoin meant to be an\neconomic safe haven for all occasions?\n\nThere are likely a number of factors at play, including the increasing amount\nof bitcoin in circulation, number of holders and whales. But in some sense,\nthe answer is clear enough, bitcoin is institutionalized. As Barron\u2019s reported\naround the time of the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility has still steadily declined since its launch more than a\ndecade ago. Volatility \u2014 as measured by the 100-day average of daily price\nswings in percentage points \u2014 hasn\u2019t exceeded 4.5% since the introduction of\nbitcoin futures, which track the price of the spot token, according to Bauer.\nSince the 2021 launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF \u2014 a bitcoin\nfutures fund \u2014 that metric hasn\u2019t exceeded 3.5%. Over the past year,\nvolatility has stayed below 2.6%.\u201d\n\nNow, volatility isn\u2019t everything (and bitcoin remains quite a bit more\nvolatile than traditional equities), but it is a defining feature of the asset\n\u2014 at least as it was known to be. Did people think bitcoin would remain\nvolatile forever? Austin Campbell, assistant professor at Columbia Business\nSchool, told CoinDesk recently, \u201cAny market growing from new to mainstream\nsees volatility due to small idiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and\nscale increase.\u201d\n\nSee also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe release of spot bitcoin ETFs, some of which have been the fastest growing\nfinancial products this year, may accelerate this trend. As the barriers to\nentry drop, and bitcoin becomes more mainstream, bitcoin\u2019s correlation with\nstocks could tighten. The same people and fund managers now buying bitcoin,\nbuy the S&P \u2014 the investor psychologies are merging.\n\nIn fact, the whole theory of \u201chyperbitcoinization\u201d rests on the idea that as\nbitcoin adoption increases, its price volatility would dissipate so it could\nactually be a viable means of exchange. The trouble is this idea was\npredicated on the idea that as a widespread, circular bitcoin economy grew,\nthe fiat system would plummet. Said differently, bitcoin was supposed to\nbecome less volatile and more uncorrelated. That was bitcoin\u2019s hedge.\n\nThis may stem from one of the foundational myths of bitcoin, that it is\n\u201cdigital gold.\u201d It\u2019s a flawed metaphor though; good in the sense that an\nassociation with gold signaled that BTC could have value but bad in setting up\nthe wrong expectations at a time before anyone really knew how bitcoin would\nbehave.\n\nThat digital gold became the go-to description is likely why we have a\nmishmash of ideas about bitcoin today; it\u2019s a hedge, a store-of-value, a means\nof payment, a beta trade, a bet against fiat and, increasingly, a development\nplatform. Everyone wants bitcoin to be everything all at once when in reality,\nover the past decade and half, it\u2019s basically done just one thing really well:\nsopping up excess liquidity.\n\nTo a large degree, we have no idea how bitcoin will perform if things hit the\nfan. As S&P analysts wrote in a 2023 report about macroeconomic impacts on\ncrypto: \u201cUnprecedented levels of monetary easing by central banks across the\nworld since 2008/09 have increased money supply to record levels,\u201d suggesting\nbitcoin grew because the money supply did.\n\nSo maybe bitcoin will follow the pack for now, growing when the overall\neconomy does, dropping when it drops. But the hedge bitcoiners are actually\nwaiting for is more like a pop.\n\n]]>\n\n<![CDATA[QCP and Further Ventures Announce Partnership for Middle East Crypto\nExpansion]]>\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/17/qcp-capital-and-further-ventures-\nannounce-partnership-for-middle-east-crypto-\nexpansion/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahoo64JXUXA3VJFTJCP5GQ2WVTV6QQWed,\n17 Apr 2024 17:00:00 +00002024-04-18T08:08:31.987+00:00\n\n* Singapore-based QCP is expanding to Abu Dhabi in a partnership with Further Ventures.\n* Abu Dhabi is making its mark on the map as an institutional crypto hub.\n\nSingapore-based cryptocurrency trading firm QCP and Further Ventures on\nWednesday announced in Dubai a partnership to expand into the Middle Eastern\nmarkets by offering new digital-asset financial and derivatives product\nofferings.\n\nQCP said that it plans to open an office in Abu Dhabi, while Further Ventures\nwill use its broker-dealer license and custodial platforms to facilitate sales\nof new products.\n\n\"Abu Dhabi is unique because it has one of the most progressive regulatory\nframeworks in the region to support the growth of institutional digital\nassets,\" Melvin Deng, CEO of QCP, said in an interview conducted over\nTelegram. \"This fits very well with how we envision regulation supporting the\necosystem as it develops and evolves.\"\n\nAbu Dhabi is quickly becoming an established institutional crypto hub.

Still, the crypto-\nfriendly candidate dominated the crowded field of fellow Democrats and then\nwon this week's Democratic runoff with 61% of the vote.\n\nOne potential difference between Figures and his opponents may have been the\n$2.7 million in behind-the-scenes support from a political action committee\n(PAC) backed by the cryptocurrency industry, Protect Progress. He drew that\nspending \u2013 known in the field of campaign finance as \"independent\nexpenditures\" that aren't an official part of a campaign \u2013 because he\nexpressed support for crypto.\n\n\"Shomari believes in working together to support innovation and create good\npaying jobs for his community and all Americans,\" Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for\nProtect Progress and affiliated industry PACs, said in a statement on\nWednesday. \"We are proud to support leaders like Shomari on both sides of the\naisle.\"\n\nFigures, who occupied roles in former President Barack Obama's White House and\nonce worked for current Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown\n(D-Ohio), said on his campaign website that he would \"embrace the new\nlandscape around digital assets, like cryptocurrency, to stimulate innovation\nand technological advancement.\"\n\nThat was enough for Protect Progress PAC \u2013 an offshoot of the main crypto\nindustry group, Fairshake \u2013 to target him with a dominant level of industry\nhelp in Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, which has been held by\nRepublicans but was redrawn before this race to favor Democrats. Figures' own\ncampaign raised a little more than $400,000 in direct contributions, according\nto the most recent disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. That was\nslightly less than his chief opponent, Anthony Daniels, the minority leader in\nthe Alabama House of Representatives, and the records show no significant PAC\nsupport for the candidates Figures faced.\n\nThe industry's spending \u2013 $2.7 million, according to the committee's\norganizers \u2013 marked the most the PAC has so far devoted to a Democratic\ncongressional candidate, followed by about $1 million for Texas Democrat Julie\nJohnson.

I am pleased to see close-to-record highs in\ndaily revenues as we approach the fourth halving, predicted around April 19.\nPleased because it reflects the business success of an industry that presently\nis running close to a $26.1 billion run rate (365 times daily revenues of\n$71.6 million).

To be clear, these are definitely growth companies.\n\nThe issue is that their Bitcoin mining segment may not be their sole source of\ngrowth. HPC-AI is a compelling business model and in demand. AI computing, of\ncourse, is in high demand these days. AI compute centers are more predictable\nas a business than self-mining. But of course it also has less optionality\nthan that $500,000 bitcoin price.\n\nBucket #3: Distressed/Value Plays\n\nFor the record, you don\u2019t want to be in this category since this presumes a\ncompany is boxed into raising capital and in a potentially distressed\nsituation as a small-cap publicly traded company. We would rather not tag any\ncompany as a distressed situation, but note that there are some 15-20\ncompanies that are micro-cap in size. Distressed, of course, does not mean\nthat some of these companies won\u2019t survive or even grow through acquisitions\nor consolidation to come out on top.\n\n]]>\n\n<![CDATA[Time to Take the Reins on Tokenization, or Risk Missing Out]]>\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/04/17/time-to-take-the-reins-on-\ntokenization-or-risk-missing-\nout/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahooK3RJKNOCXVHXJK7YZY7QVJBRAUWed,\n17 Apr 2024 16:00:00 +00002024-04-17T16:00:00.897+00:00The arrival of the\nfirst bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January was a turning point for the\nconvergence of traditional and digital assets. For the first time, investors\nwere granted exposure to bitcoin through their traditional brokerage account.\n\nThe core technology associated with bitcoin, cryptography, is not new but it\nhas re-emerged with blockchain and smart contract technology, which supports\ntokenization. A token is a unit of value that can be transferred, stored, and\ntraded on the blockchain and is a digital representation of potentially many\ndifferent kinds of assets, such as ownership rights for cryptocurrencies as\nwell as real-world assets like stock shares, real estate or even art. For\nsome, the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs helped boost the legitimacy of this\ntechnology, and now we\u2019re seeing more firms and retail investors exploring the\nmany benefits of tokenization.\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights,\nnews and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in\nyour inbox every Wednesday.\n\nWith tokenization, firms could be more capital-efficient, create new business\nmodels and more easily expand product offerings and distribution channels.\nFirms could unlock new efficiencies and uncover ways to streamline existing\nprocesses while finding new markets and ways of unlocking liquidity \u2013 and they\ncan likely do it cheaper and faster.\n\nAt the same time, tokenization could revolutionize the way transactions are\nprocessed. Take securities lending for example. With tokenization, collateral\ncould be exchanged in real time, enabling firms to lower the risk of their\nexisting processes. Managing a securities lending pool using smart contracts,\nor transactions that automatically execute when certain conditions are met,\ncould also unlock efficiencies by embedding compliance within tokens, paving\nthe way to 24/7 trading \u2013 without the need for a network of trading desks\naround the world.\n\nThese benefits, however, are just the tip of the iceberg. The real promise of\nblockchain technology lies in the assets themselves. Consider how assets\noperate today. Various systems are needed to run vital processes such as\npricing an asset, distributing interest and dividends, and communicating with\ninvestors. With tokenization, we could incorporate these processes into the\nasset itself. Given a tokenized asset is capable of executing automated\nprocesses on its own, we could eliminate the need for potentially dozens of\nsystems working behind the scenes.\n\nIf the benefits are so tangible, why haven\u2019t we seen more widespread adoption\nin the financial services industry? Mainly because we are somewhat still in\nthe infancy stage around this technology, and policymakers are still assessing\nthe landscape and considering the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nThere are also concerns about counterparty risk, finality of settlement, and\ncontrol locations, not to mention a lack of standards and taxonomy. More\nphilosophically, digital asset owners want to ensure that their ownership\nrights will be preserved in the absence of a tangible asset they can hold in\ntheir hand.\n\nAt the same time, the industry\u2019s approach to innovation continues in siloes\nand represents another roadblock to adoption. In 2023, nearly three out of\nfour projects involving distributed ledger technology (DLT) had fewer than\nseven participants, according to a study from the International Securities\nServices Association (ISSA). Of course, it\u2019s encouraging to see firms dive in\nand explore DLT. However, if innovation continues in silos, one of the core\npromises offered by tokenization will be missed: creating broad efficiencies\nacross the industry.\n\nThe answer here is simple: let\u2019s work together. Experiments should have a\nshared infrastructure. There should be many participants representing the\nfinancial industry\u2019s wide range of stakeholders. There\u2019s mutual benefit to be\nfound here. Together, we can lay the foundation for successful experimentation\nin sandboxes with initiatives that expand upon each other incrementally and\ncreate an ecosystem that\u2019s scalable and works for all counterparties.\n\nCollaboration would also help ensure digital assets thrive within a well-\nregulated framework, with standardized governance that reduces risks and\ncosts. In addition, collaboration could facilitate connectivity by improving\noptionality and the choice of platforms, ultimately improving the way digital\nassets interact with traditional securities and payment infrastructures.\n\nBut before all of this, firms must look inward to realize the full potential\nof tokenization. There\u2019s no one size-fits-all approach, and every organization\nhas its own, unique business model. More and more firms from across the\nindustry are sitting down and thinking through what tokenization means for\nthem. How can it revolutionize their business and the way it serves their\nclients?\n\nIn the end, the value of tokenization is directly correlated to the strength\nof a firm\u2019s imagination. We are only limited by our creativity in the way\nwe\u2019re able to reimagine business and operating models, and the way\ntokenization could unlock new opportunities.\n\n]]>\n\nThis XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with\nit.

It takes about 10 minutes to\nverify a new block, and there are roughly 144 blocks verified every day, which\nequates to rewards of 900 BTC each day. Thus, the supply of BTC increases by\nthis amount daily.</p><p>For every 210,000 blocks mined, the mining rewards\navailable are reduced or halved. This occurs approximately every four years.\nAfter this upcoming halving, the fourth in the blockchain's 15-year history, a\nminer will receive 3.125 BTC for verifying a block, instead of 6.25 BTC. This\nwill reduce the new BTC daily supply to about 450 BTC.</p><p><b>What is the\ncurrent market status?</b></p><p>The daily exchange-traded volume of BTC\nvaries depending on the source, but looking at the <a\nhref=\"https://messari.io/\"><u>Messari</u></a> volumes, we see a daily volume\nrange of around $30 billion. At current prices (BTC = $64,000), the reduced\nnew supply will equal $29 million or roughly 1% of the average daily exchange\ntraded volume, down from 2%.</p><p>Miners, however, may not sell all their new\ncoins. Research from <a href=\"https://blog.coinshares.com/coinshares-mining-\nreport-the-halving-and-its-impact-on-hash-rate-and-miners-cost-\nstructures-8646835d88ac\"><u>CoinShares</u></a> suggests that the average cost\nof mining a bitcoin after the halving will be around $40,000, depending on\nmany variables. So, miners whose operational costs are less than the current\nmarket rate may choose to hold their coin and not bring it to market. However,\nthis was always the case. You have some miners that sell all the rewarded BTC\nwhen they get it (either to take profit, cover operational costs or for\ncapital investment) and others who hold excess Bitcoin in the expectation of\nprice appreciation.</p><p>Another consideration is the \"free float\" (coins\nactively trading) in BTC. Currently, circa 93.5% or 19.635 million of all BTC\nhave been mined. Of that, <a\nhref=\"https://chainexposed.com/SthVsLthSupply.html\"><u>about 75% </u></a> are\nconsidered to be held long-term (where BTC has been sitting in a wallet for\nlonger than 155 days). This would leave a free float of ~5 million BTC,\nincreasing the supply by 0.01% daily.</p><p>Also to consider are the new spot\nbitcoin ETFs. The <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/?p=997\"><u>average daily\ninflow volume</u></a> into the new ETFs (including grayscale outflows) is $202\nmillion. This is far more influential on prices than the reduction in\nsupply.</p><p><b>What could this mean for the price of\nbitcoin?</b></p><p>Whilst it is obvious that a decrease in the supply should\nbe net positive for the price of any commodity, this should also be true for\nbitcoin. The question is, how much should it increase and has the increase in\nprice already been built into the current price? As we have seen with the ETF\nannouncements, most pre-determined headlines become \"Buy the rumour, sell the\nfact\" events, and we see a risk of that here too.</p><p>We don\u2019t find value in\nlooking back on previous halvings, as there are not enough data points to be\nstatistically meaningful. Additionally, trying to extrapolate correlations to\nhalvings in an instrument that has gone up from $0 to $70,000 in a short\nperiod of time is difficult.</p><p>A much larger influence on the price of\nbitcoin will be the ETF flows, as these have the potential to change depending\non sentiment dramatically. These flows can easily outstrip the reduction in\nsupply from the halving.</p><p><b>In Summary:</b></p><p>We see the halving\nmaking a much larger impact on miners than the bitcoin price. Miners will have\nto adjust their operations to accommodate the smaller rewards they will get,\nwhether that is by capital expenditure on more efficient equipment, cutting\noperational costs, or, indeed, selling more of their mined bitcoin.</p><p>One\nof the goals for participants in the digital asset space is to increase\ninstitutional adoption. Reducing the daily new supply by $31.5 million in a\nmarket that already transacts approximately $30 billion is relatively trivial.\nIf the market cannot handle a reduction of $31.5 million daily supply, then it\nis not ready for institutions.</p><p>Look out for the ETF flows; they will\ndictate the price more so than a small decrease in supply growth.</p><p><b>\\-\n</b><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/author/mick-roche/\"\ntarget=\"_blank\"><b>Mick Roche, senior trader, Zodia\nMarkets</b></a></p><h2><b>Ask an Expert</b></h2><p><b>Q. How does the bitcoin\nhalving affect the supply of bitcoin, and what impact does this have on its\nprice?</b></p><p>The supply of bitcoin in the secondary market depends on\nholders looking to sell existing bitcoin and miners looking to sell the newly\nminted bitcoin they are awarded. Generally, in between halvings, the release\nof these new bitcoins creates a kind of equilibrium in the supply/demand\ndynamic of the secondary market where the reward can support the demand. When\nthe halving occurs it creates a supply shock as the equilibrium is disturbed\nand no longer meets demand. Historically this has been a catalyst for the\nprice to increase dramatically.</p><p><b>Q. Can you explain the concept of\n\"halving cycles\" in the context of Bitcoin's price history?</b></p><p>Since\nthe halving is programmed to occur every 210,000 blocks, it creates a distinct\ntime frame between these events that lasts about four years. In these four\nyears, there has historically been a peak price, a trough price, a bull\nportion of the cycle, and a bear portion of the cycle. The most price\nappreciation has historically been in the month preceding and following the\nhalving. This is a result of the supply shock that the halving creates. After\nthe new supply/demand equilibrium is reached, the price peaks and then a\ndrastic sell-off occurs until the BTC price finds its bottom or trough. This\nis usually 12-18 months after the halving. Once we get to the bottom, the\nprice chops around, then steadily rises until we get close to the halving, and\nthe cycle repeats.</p><p><b>Q. What are some potential strategies for\ninvestors to consider before, during, and after a Bitcoin halving\nevent?</b></p><p>The main strategy we recommend to an investor with a long\ntime horizon is just to buy and hold. Crypto volatility can be hard to manage,\nand it\u2019s easy to get caught on the wrong side of a trade. That tends to lead\nto very emotional and sub-optimal decision-making. Over a multi-year\ntimeframe, Bitcoin has tended to provide a great return to investors, so\ntrying to improve on an already great return isn\u2019t necessary to make a\nstrategy successful.</p><p><b>\\- </b><a\nhref=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFcourchesne/\"><u><b>Bryan\nCourchesne, CEO, DAIM</b></u></a></p><h2><b>Keep\nReading</b></h2><ul><li>Bitcoin and ether ETFs <a\nhref=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/hong-kong-gives-initial-\napproval-first-bitcoin-ether-spot-etfs-say-funds-2024-04-15/\"><u>received the\ngreen light</u></a> Monday in Hong Kong and are expected to begin trading at\nthe end of April.</li><li>You can watch the bitcoin <a\nhref=\"https://watcher.guru/bitcoin-halving\"><u>halving countdown live</u></a>,\nthanks to the transparency of blockchain.</li><li>The halving explained, a\ndeeper read including more details on the bitcoin 21 million supply cap is\navailable <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-\nexplained/\"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul> ]]>\n\n...\n\n</content:encoded>\n\n<media:content\nurl=\"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/8sU9FmMtsZAqjG6z9MvUmc2UIj8=/cloudfront-\nus-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/Z3UIPB774BDPBIA4VBIOMPHCRM.jpg\"\ntype=\"image/jpeg\" height=\"3840\" width=\"5760\">\n\n<media:description type=\"plain\">\n\n<![CDATA[ (Markus Spiske/Unsplash) ]]>\n\n...\n\n</media:description>\n\n...\n\n</media:content>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTC-USD\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTC\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTCUSD=X\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>\n\n<![CDATA[ Bitcoin Halving Partially Priced In With No Big Rally Expected\nAfterward: Deutsche Bank ]]>\n\n...\n\n</title>\n\n<link>https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/18/bitcoin-halving-partially-\npriced-in-with-no-big-rally-expected-afterward-deutsche-\nbank/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahoo</link>\n\n<link\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/arc/outboundfeeds/yahoo/nrys8o/?outputType=xml\"\nrel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/\" rel=\"hub\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/18/bitcoin-halving-\npartially-priced-in-with-no-big-rally-expected-afterward-deutsche-bank/\"\nrel=\"canonical\"/>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">IZXLMCMPXRHT7FHWU44FXX5AAE</guid>\n\n<dc:creator>\n\n<![CDATA[ Will Canny ]]>\n\n...\n\n</dc:creator>\n\n<description>\n\n<![CDATA[ Crypto prices are likely to stay high in anticipation of spot ether\nETF approvals, central bank rate cuts, and regulatory changes, the report\nsaid. ]]>\n\n...\n\n</description>\n\n<pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 15:43:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\n<atom:updated>2024-04-18T15:46:18.345+00:00</atom:updated>\n\n<category domain=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Markets ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Bitcoin Halving ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Halving ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<content:encoded>\n\n<![CDATA[ <ul><li>The bitcoin halving is already partially priced in, the\nreport said.</li><li>Deutsche Bank said it does not expect a large rally after\nthe event.</li><li>The geography of crypto miners is expected to shift\nfollowing the halving to countries with lower energy costs, the bank\nsaid.</li></ul><p>The bitcoin {{BTC}} reward halving, expected in the next\ncouple of days, has already been partially priced in by the market and a large\nrally in the cryptocurrency is unlikely after it occurs, Deutsche Bank (DB)\nsaid in a research report on Thursday.</p><p>The quadrennial <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-explained/\"><u>reward\nhalving</u></a> slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply and is expected to\noccur around <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-\nmagazine/2024/04/12/why-bitcoin-halving-calculators-are-out-of-sync/\"><u>April\n19-20</u></a>.</p><p>Bitcoin has climbed 44% year-to-date, CoinDesk Indices\ndata show, more than double the gain of the <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/indices/cd20\"><u>CoinDesk 20 Index</u></a>, a\nmeasure of the broader crypto market.

Financial technology companies \u2013 fintechs \u2013 such as Revolut and\nRobinhood (HOOD) provide the distribution frameworks for the digitization of\nfinancial services. But they still rely on TradFi as the manufacturer, Frambot\nsaid.</p><p>That will change, he said, and points to several pieces of\nevidence for his thesis that DeFi will scale through a combination of\ncentralized crypto exchanges and fintech firms.</p><p>For instance, many\nfintechs and exchanges have noted the success U.S.-listed crypto exchange\nCoinbase (COIN) has had so far with <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/09/coinbase-officially-launches-\nbase-blockchain-milestone-for-a-public-company/\"><u>Base</u></a>, its <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-layer-2s/\">layer-2\nblockchain</a>, and decided to build or partner with layer 2s themselves,\nFrambot said. Robinhood <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/02/29/trading-platform-robinhood-\nlayer-2-arbitrum-team-up-to-offer-swaps-to-\nusers/#:~:text=10%20Years%20of%20Decentralizing%20the%20Future&amp;text=According%20to%20a%20press%20release,use%20Web3%20on%20Robinhood%20Wallet.%E2%80%9D\"><u>in\nFebruary announced</u></a> it was working with layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum,\nand many other fintech firms now have in place wallet infrastructure to\nseamlessly connect with Web3.</p><p>\u201cTradFi has very little interest in moving\nto DeFi, to be frank, just because they have such an unfair advantage with\ntheir current infrastructure,\u201d Frambot said in an interview. \u201cHowever,\nfintechs don't have their own financial infrastructure, they have to go\nthrough all the fees of the TradFi guys. But they have distribution, they have\nadoption. So if they start owning their own infrastructure by building on top\nof layer-2s and immutable DeFi, then they can start generating more profits\nfrom it, gain efficiency and limit their operating costs.\u201d</p><p>\"I'm still\nfrustrated that we're not changing finance at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're still\nplaying for crypto users that already have crypto. The promise of the open\nfinancial infrastructure underpinning every financial service is miles and\nmiles away from where we are right now. And I think because there is so much\nmoney to make from just the crypto game, there are few incentives for founders\nto think beyond this.\u201d</p><p>The answer to DeFi\u2019s scaling problems also\ninvolves protocols that are neutral, like the rails of the internet itself,\nwhich can easily be built on top of, Frambot said. Having started out as a\nvery successful optimization service on top of DiFi giants like Aave, using a\nmatching engine to reduce spreads and offer users better interest rates,\nMorpho later transitioned to become a base-level protocol, more like Uniswap,\nthe largest decentralized exchange by trading volume on the Ethereum\nblockchain.</p><p>The model of a broker or fund that exists on-chain, like\nAave or Compound, that is necessarily mutable and continually subject to\nhundreds of risk-management governance decisions will not scale to the degree\nrequired to make DeFi mainstream, in Frambot\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cWe can't have\n[a] one-size-fits-all monolith that meets all the different compliance needs\nof the world,\u201d Frambot said. \u201cPeople want different [know your customer] or\nrisk. So you have to have the core protocol that is completely un-opinionated,\nand people build specific financial products on top for their specific use\ncases.\u201d</p> ]]>\n\n...\n\n</content:encoded>\n\n<media:content\nurl=\"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/BezRz0rtEX6zm_IMW_0WUEUt29A=/cloudfront-\nus-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/XCP4F42MENAKFOFSN76KH5B2RU.jpg\"\ntype=\"image/jpeg\" height=\"1921\" width=\"3415\">\n\n<media:description type=\"plain\">\n\n<![CDATA[ (Christine Roy/Unplash) ]]>\n\n...\n\n</media:description>\n\n<media:credit role=\"author\" scheme=\"urn:ebu\"/>\n\n...\n\n</media:content>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"ETH-USD\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"ETH\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"ETHUSD=X\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>\n\n<![CDATA[ Tether Reorganizes Into 4 Divisions as It Expands Beyond Stablecoins\n]]>\n\n...\n\n</title>\n\n<link>https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/04/18/tether-reorganizes-\ninto-4-divisions-as-it-expands-beyond-\nstablecoins/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahoo</link>\n\n<link\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/arc/outboundfeeds/yahoo/nrys8o/?outputType=xml\"\nrel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/\" rel=\"hub\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/04/18/tether-reorganizes-\ninto-4-divisions-as-it-expands-beyond-stablecoins/\" rel=\"canonical\"/>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">ZPAU5G5PUBDGJPMU4VMTTDMFQA</guid>\n\n<dc:creator>\n\n<![CDATA[ Jamie Crawley ]]>\n\n...\n\n</dc:creator>\n\n<description>\n\n<![CDATA[ The company has formed four divisions to reflect its broadening\nfocus: Data, Finance, Power and Edu(cation). ]]>\n\n...\n\n</description>\n\n<pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 11:15:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\n<atom:updated>2024-04-18T12:03:14.623+00:00</atom:updated>\n\n<category domain=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Finance ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Tether ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Mining ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ AI ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ reorganization ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Stablecoins ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<content:encoded>\n\n<![CDATA[ <ul><li>The issuer of the largest stablecoin by market cap said the\nData, Finance, Power and Edu divisions reflect its broadened\nmission.</li><li>The company has already invested in several areas outside\nUSDT.</li></ul><p>Tether, the developer of the world's largest stablecoin,\nsaid it is reorganizing to reflect its expansion into other areas of digital\nassets.</p><p>The company formed four divisions to reflect its broadening\nfocus: Data will handle strategic investment in technology including\nartificial intelligence (AI); Finance will cover the USDT stablecoin, which\nhas a market cap in excess of $100 billion and plays a pivotal role in crypto\nmarkets; Power becomes the umbrella for investments in bitcoin {{BTC}} mining\nand Edu is the home for educational activities.</p><p>\"Tether\u2019s expansion\nbeyond its well-established USDT stablecoin signifies a paradigm shift in its\napproach to financial empowerment,\" the company <a\nhref=\"https://tether.io/news/tether-advances-beyond-stablecoins-introduces-\nnew-framework-embracing-core-divisions-to-foster-resilient-future-ready-\nfinancial-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>. \"By focusing on\nsustainable solutions adaptive to the needs of individuals, communities,\ncities and countries, responsible Bitcoin mining, Artificial Intelligence\ninfrastructure and decentralised communication platforms, Tether is actively\ncontributing to a future-proof financial and tech ecosystem.\"</p><p>While the\n10-year-old company is already active in these areas, the establishment of\ndistinct divisions reflects the growing importance it attaches to interests\nbeyond its flagship stablecoin.

His mother and two\nother family members were in the gallery during the proceedings. Though his\nattorneys suggested he may testify earlier in the trial, his defense\nultimately rested without calling him to the stand.</p><p>The defense\u2019s case\non Monday and Tuesday largely hinged on a single expert witness, former Secret\nService agent-turned crypto investigations consultant Jeremy Sheridan. Over\ntwo days of testimony he spoke to the mechanisms that enabled Eisenberg\u2019s\ntrades and the difficulty of understanding whether his borrows were, according\nto Mango Markets\u2019 codebase, actually borrows at all. But much of his testimony\ngot thrown out by the judge after the court determined his knowledge of Mango\nMarkets\u2019 codebase was itself insufficient.</p><p>Prosecutors have argued that\nEisenberg engaged in market manipulation, trading large sums of MNGO perpetual\nfutures contracts between himself to pump the price over 1000%, then using his\nnewly-created collateral to fool the platform into allowing him drain $110\nmillion in various cryptocurrencies via the platform\u2019s \u201cborrow\u201d\nfunction.</p><p>But Eisenberg wasn\u2019t borrowing, prosecutors told the jury on\nWednesday \u2013 he was stealing. Hours after the exploit, he issued an\n\u201cextortionate\u201d anonymous proposal to the Mango Markets decentralized\nautonomous organization (DAO) offering to return $67 million of his haul in\nexchange for promises not to pursue criminal charges or freeze the rest of the\nstolen funds.</p><p>The facts of the case were largely undisputed by\nEisenberg\u2019s defense team when they took the stand. Instead, Eisenberg\u2019s lead\nattorney, Brian Klein, attempted to frame Eisenberg\u2019s massive trades as a\n\u201csuccessful and legal trading strategy\u201d that \u201cfully complied\u201d with the Mango\nMarkets protocol. Klein pointed to Mango Markets\u2019 lack of Terms of Use \u2013 only\na checkbox that told visitors to use the site \u201cat your own risk\u201d \u2013 at the time\nof Eisenberg\u2019s exploit, arguing that he simply used the platform as intended\nand made a lot of money doing it.</p><p>\u201cThis is how people do things in this\nworld of crypto,\u201d Klein told the jury.</p><p>Klein is a <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/10/meet-brian-klein-cryptos-\nown-high-stakes-trial-attorney/\">well-known defense attorney</a> in the crypto\nsphere, whose past clients include Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem and Virgil\nGriffith. Klein is also currently representing Tornado Cash developer Roman\nStorm.</p><p>Prosecutors told the jury a different version of the story.\nEisenberg, they said, knew what he was doing was illegal.</p><p>Before his\nexploit, Eisenberg had sued someone else in federal court for manipulating the\nprice of WAVES. He\u2019d also made internet searches for things like \u201cstatute of\nlimitations market manipulation\u201d and \u201celements of fraud\u201d before his October\n2022 trades. After the trades \u2013 and once his identity as the exploiter had\nbeen exposed \u2013 Eisenberg bought a ticket for a flight to Israel and searched\nfor \u201cFBI surveillance,\u201d \u201clist of Israel extraditions\u201d and \u201cOtisville prison,\u201d\na white-collar federal penitentiary.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you think\nyou\u2019ve committed a crime,\u201d the prosecutor told the jury.</p><p>Klein told the\njury Eisenberg didn\u2019t go to Israel to escape charges, but instead because\nangry Mango Markets\u2019 users were threatening his safety. Klein also said that\nthe fact that Eisenberg sued both Circle and AscendX, a nominally Romanian\nexchange, to get his money back once it was frozen \u2013 as well as his willing\nreturn to the U.S. \u2013 was further evidence that he did not believe he had\ncommitted a crime.</p><p>In their rebuttal, prosecutors said that Eisenberg\u2019s\nlegal attempts to get his money were made after his identity as the exploiter\nhad been exposed. He thought that his proposal to Mango Markets\u2019 DAO, and its\nsubsequent \u201cwaiver of liability,\u201d meant he was off the hook, emboldening him\nto come back to the U.S., they said.</p><p>\u201cManipulation, lies, deceit \u2013 it\u2019s\ncriminal, whether it happens on Wall Street or on a computer program,\u201d the\nprosecutor said.</p><p>Eisenberg faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted\non all three counts.</p> ]]>\n\n...\n\n</content:encoded>\n\n<media:content\nurl=\"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Yd0dlIQxYBSLvdvWcrfGRk3kWXw=/cloudfront-\nus-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/FXUJKA4GJJF2FGRY4ZL6DNJGHM.jpg\"\ntype=\"image/jpeg\" height=\"3840\" width=\"5760\">\n\n<media:description type=\"plain\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Mango (Desirae Hayes-Vitor/Unsplash) ]]>\n\n...\n\n</media:description>\n\n...\n\n</media:content>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>\n\n<![CDATA[ The Protocol: Bitcoin Halving Spectacular, With Runes, 'Epic Sat,'\nStacks Nakamoto ]]>\n\n...\n\n</title>\n\n<link>https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/17/the-protocol-bitcoin-halving-\nspectacular-with-runes-epic-sat-stacks-\nnakamoto/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahoo</link>\n\n<link\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/arc/outboundfeeds/yahoo/nrys8o/?outputType=xml\"\nrel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/\" rel=\"hub\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/17/the-protocol-bitcoin-\nhalving-spectacular-with-runes-epic-sat-stacks-nakamoto/\" rel=\"canonical\"/>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">EI44IG2HJJFTDHKY5P3AFOCOQM</guid>\n\n<dc:creator>\n\n<![CDATA[ Bradley Keoun ]]>\n\n...\n\n</dc:creator>\n\n<description>\n\n<![CDATA[ Unlike the last Bitcoin halving, a ho-hum affair where Covid-locked-\ndown gawkers had little choice but to tune into livestreamed watch parties,\nthe upcoming Bitcoin halving comes with project launches, competitions and IRL\ncelebrations in Denver and Costa Rica. ]]>\n\n...\n\n</description>\n\n<pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 18:49:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\n<atom:updated>2024-04-17T18:54:27.412+00:00</atom:updated>\n\n<category domain=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Technology ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ The Protocol ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Bitcoin Halving ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Ethereum ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Runes protocol ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<content:encoded>\n\n<![CDATA[ <p>It's hard not to draw parallels between the general mood across\nparts of the planet last week, when people were jockeying to glimpse the solar\neclipse, and the excitement building this week in the Bitcoin community, as\nthe blockchain's quadrennial halving approaches.

The move\ninspired a few columns on Monday, including insightful ones from Fortune\u2019s\nJeff John Roberts, which put it in context of gold\u2019s 17% rally, and <a\nhref=\"https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-start-to-bitcoin-halving-\nweek\">Blockwork\u2019s</a> Casey Wagner, who looked at how gas prices tend to move\nduring crises in the Middle East.</p><p><i><b>Read more from CoinDesk\u2019s\n</b></i><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-halving/\"\ntarget=\"_blank\"><i><b>\u201cFuture of Bitcoin\u201d package</b></i></a><i><b>.\n</b></i><i><b>This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of\nthe most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond.

But\nI\u2019ve always been of the view that intraday price movements for an asset as\nvolatile as bitcoin say very little. The bad news is: gold is continuing to\nrise (like it did after the <a href=\"https://www.bullion-\nrates.com/gold/USD/2008-9-history.htm\">collapse of Lehman Brothers</a>), while\nafter a little pop on Sunday, bitcoin has been sagging lower and lower this\nweek into the low $60K range.</p><p>While the looming threat of WWIII may be\nputting a damper on bitcoin, it\u2019s likely inklings emanating out from the\nFederal Reserve that it may hold interest rates higher for longer than\nanticipated because the economy is doing well that <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/video/is-crypto-at-the-mercy-of-fed-rates-and-\nmacro-conditions-\nnow/?_gl=1*1i62dpc*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTA4MTg0MjU5Mi4xNzEzMzc0NTA1*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTcxMzM3NDUwNS4xLjAuMTcxMzM3NDUwNS4wLjAuMA..\">the\nmarket is responding to</a>. Still, to raise the question of whether bitcoin\nis <i>really </i>a hedge \u2014 when in recent years it has clearly been behaving\nmore and more <a href=\"https://www.etfstream.com/articles/correlations-crypto-\nis-growing-up\">like a tech stock</a> \u2014 seems like the wrong thing to\nask.</p><p>Bitcoin was largely uncorrelated with the S&amp;P 500 before the\npandemic, so clearly it can act as a countercyclical asset. The question is:\nWhat changed from then to now? Also, what exactly is bitcoin meant to hedge?\nStocks? Inflation? U.S. Treasuries? Political turmoil? Is bitcoin meant to be\nan economic safe haven for all occasions?</p><p>There are likely a number of\nfactors at play, including the increasing amount of bitcoin in circulation,\nnumber of holders and whales. But in some sense, the answer is clear enough,\nbitcoin is institutionalized. As <a\nhref=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-etfs-crypto-stock-\nmarket-c358c557\">Barron\u2019s reported</a> around the time of the launch of spot\nbitcoin ETFs in January:</p><p>\u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility has still steadily\ndeclined since its launch more than a decade ago. Volatility \u2014 as measured by\nthe 100-day average of daily price swings in percentage points \u2014 hasn\u2019t\nexceeded 4.5% since the introduction of bitcoin futures, which track the price\nof the spot token, according to Bauer. Since the 2021 launch of the <a\nhref=\"https://www.barrons.com/market-\ndata/funds/bito?mod=article_chiclet\">ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF</a> \u2014 a\nbitcoin futures fund \u2014 that metric hasn\u2019t exceeded 3.5%. Over the past year,\nvolatility has stayed below 2.6%.\u201d</p><p>Now, volatility isn\u2019t everything (and\nbitcoin remains quite a bit more volatile than traditional equities), but it\nis a defining feature of the asset \u2014 at least as it was known to be. Did\npeople think bitcoin would remain volatile forever? Austin Campbell, assistant\nprofessor at Columbia Business School, <a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/16/what-bitcoiners-\nare-saying-about-the-upcoming-bitcoin-halving/\">told CoinDesk recently</a>,\n\u201cAny market growing from new to mainstream sees volatility due to small\nidiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and scale\nincrease.\u201d</p><p><i><b>See also: </b></i><a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/16/what-bitcoiners-\nare-saying-about-the-upcoming-bitcoin-halving/\" target=\"_blank\"><i><b>What\nBitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving</b></i></a></p><p>The\nrelease of spot bitcoin ETFs, some of which have been the fastest growing\nfinancial products this year, may accelerate this trend. As the barriers to\nentry drop, and bitcoin becomes more mainstream, bitcoin\u2019s correlation with\nstocks could tighten. The same people and fund managers now buying bitcoin,\nbuy the S&amp;P \u2014 the investor psychologies are merging.</p><p>In fact, the\nwhole theory of \u201chyperbitcoinization\u201d rests on the idea that as bitcoin\nadoption increases, its price volatility would dissipate so it could actually\nbe a viable means of exchange. The trouble is this idea was predicated on the\nidea that as a widespread, circular bitcoin economy grew, the fiat system\nwould plummet. Said differently, bitcoin was supposed to become less volatile\nand more uncorrelated. That was bitcoin\u2019s hedge.</p><p>This may stem from one\nof the foundational myths of bitcoin, that it is \u201cdigital gold.\u201d It\u2019s a flawed\nmetaphor though; good in the sense that an association with gold signaled that\nBTC could have value but bad in setting up the wrong expectations at a time\nbefore anyone really knew how bitcoin would behave.</p><p>That digital gold\nbecame the go-to description is likely why we have a mishmash of ideas about\nbitcoin today; it\u2019s a hedge, a store-of-value, a means of payment, a beta\ntrade, a bet against fiat and, increasingly, a development platform. Everyone\nwants bitcoin to be everything all at once when in reality, over the past\ndecade and half, it\u2019s basically done just one thing really well: sopping up\nexcess liquidity.</p><p>To a large degree, we have no idea how bitcoin will\nperform if things hit the fan. As S&amp;P analysts wrote in a 2023 report\nabout macroeconomic impacts on crypto: \u201cUnprecedented levels of monetary\neasing by central banks across the world since 2008/09 have increased money\nsupply to record levels,\u201d suggesting bitcoin grew because the money supply\ndid.</p><p>So maybe bitcoin will follow the pack for now, growing when the\noverall economy does, dropping when it drops. But the hedge bitcoiners are\nactually waiting for is more like a pop.</p> ]]>\n\n...\n\n</content:encoded>\n\n<media:content\nurl=\"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rf9c1IBXOpAx38K7iKDbVg_NObE=/cloudfront-\nus-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3USOSKIPJBBVTPYQJNLGTVIDNE.jpg\"\ntype=\"image/jpeg\" height=\"1350\" width=\"2400\">\n\n<media:description type=\"plain\">\n\n<![CDATA[ (engin akyurt/Unsplash) ]]>\n\n...\n\n</media:description>\n\n<media:credit role=\"author\" scheme=\"urn:ebu\"/>\n\n...\n\n</media:content>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTC-USD\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTC\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTCUSD=X\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>\n\n<![CDATA[ QCP and Further Ventures Announce Partnership for Middle East Crypto\nExpansion ]]>\n\n...\n\n</title>\n\n<link>https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/17/qcp-capital-and-further-\nventures-announce-partnership-for-middle-east-crypto-\nexpansion/?utm_campaign=c23&utm_medium=liscensing&utm_source=yahoo</link>\n\n<link\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/arc/outboundfeeds/yahoo/nrys8o/?outputType=xml\"\nrel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/\" rel=\"hub\"/>\n\n<link href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/17/qcp-capital-and-\nfurther-ventures-announce-partnership-for-middle-east-crypto-expansion/\"\nrel=\"canonical\"/>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">64JXUXA3VJFTJCP5GQ2WVTV6QQ</guid>\n\n<dc:creator>\n\n<![CDATA[ Sam Reynolds ]]>\n\n...\n\n</dc:creator>\n\n<description>\n\n<![CDATA[ Both companies plan to develop new institutional digital offerings,\nwhile QCP is set to open an Abu Dhabi shop. ]]>\n\n...\n\n</description>\n\n<pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\n<atom:updated>2024-04-18T08:08:31.987+00:00</atom:updated>\n\n<category domain=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Policy ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ QCP Capital ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Abu Dhabi ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<category domain=\"tag\">\n\n<![CDATA[ Abu Dhabi Global Market ]]>\n\n...\n\n</category>\n\n<content:encoded>\n\n<![CDATA[ <ul><li>Singapore-based QCP is expanding to Abu Dhabi in a\npartnership with Further Ventures.</li><li>Abu Dhabi is making its mark on the\nmap as an institutional crypto hub.</li></ul><p>Singapore-based cryptocurrency\ntrading firm QCP and Further Ventures on Wednesday announced in Dubai a\npartnership to expand into the Middle Eastern markets by offering new digital-\nasset financial and derivatives product offerings.</p><p>QCP said that it\nplans to open an office in Abu Dhabi, while Further Ventures will use its\nbroker-dealer license and custodial platforms to facilitate sales of new\nproducts.</p><p>\"Abu Dhabi is unique because it has one of the most\nprogressive regulatory frameworks in the region to support the growth of\ninstitutional digital assets,\" Melvin Deng, CEO of QCP, said in an interview\nconducted over Telegram. \"This fits very well with how we envision regulation\nsupporting the ecosystem as it develops and evolves.\"</p><p>Abu Dhabi is\nquickly becoming an established institutional crypto hub.

I\nam pleased to see close-to-record highs in daily revenues as we approach the\nfourth halving, predicted around April 19. Pleased because it reflects the\nbusiness success of an industry that presently is running close to a $26.1\nbillion run rate (365 times daily revenues of $71.6 million). As one of the\nmost substantial investors in the space, with almost $100 million allocated in\nour portfolio, the outcome of how this business is financed and valued is\nimportant to us.</p><p>Despite the optimism expressed by investors, we can\nunderstand why miners and investors are facing the halving with trepidation.\nWe would also like to point out that 1st quarter profitable financials results\nexpected by some of the miners seem more than discounted at current levels.\nMany mining stocks could be looking at forward-EV/EBITDA multiples in the very\nlow single digits versus 2024 and 2025.</p><p>Of course, any single digit\nmultiple assumed on valuation metrics must assume a Bitcoin price of between\n$70,000 to $100,000 which we would argue is reasonable given the current\nmomentum in the price of Bitcoin. Conversely, given that these are technology\ncompanies, we would have to admit that execution risk at scale has proven a\nhigh hurdle to achieve.</p><p><b>You're reading</b><a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/\"><b> Crypto Long\n&amp; Short</b></a><b>, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and\nanalysis for the professional investor.</b><a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/\"><b> Sign up\nhere</b></a><b> to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.</b></p><p>How we view\nthe industry:</p><p><u><b>Bucket 1: Accelerators: CLSK, MARA and\nRIOT</b></u></p><p>A few companies like Cleanspark, Marathon Digital and RIOT\nPlatforms have positioned themselves as large scale miners aggressively\nraising capital through At-The Market Offerings (ATMs). These companies are\nexpected to show accelerating growth in revenues due from higher Bitcoin price\nand significant beta from exahash expansion.</p><p>As such, they have drawn a\ncompetitive advantage from an increase in trading activity, ample financial\nliquidity and or a war chest to capitalize on acquisition opportunities.\nPeople who are disappointed by the recent failure of the mining stocks to keep\nup with the price of bitcoin are missing the fact that this correlation is\nsustainable but frequently behaves like a coiled spring&gt; The question is\ntiming and the near term direction of bitcoin at $60K or $100K. All bets are\noff at $500K.</p><p><u><b>Bucket #2: HPC-AI Group (IREN, CORE, BTBT, HIVE,\nHUT)</b></u></p><p>Pragmatic oriented companies such as Core Scientific\n(CORZ), Iris Energy (IREN), Bit Digital (BTBT) or Hut8 (HUT) are led by\nmanagers who are executing under the pretext that traditional financial\nmetrics matter in the context of measuring discipline. To be clear, these are\ndefinitely growth companies.</p><p>The issue is that their Bitcoin mining\nsegment may not be their sole source of growth. HPC-AI is a compelling\nbusiness model and in demand. AI computing, of course, is in high demand these\ndays.

For the\nfirst time, investors were granted exposure to bitcoin through their\ntraditional brokerage account.</p><p>The core technology associated with\nbitcoin, cryptography, is not new but it has re-emerged with blockchain and\nsmart contract technology, which supports tokenization. A token is a unit of\nvalue that can be transferred, stored, and traded on the blockchain and is a\ndigital representation of potentially many different kinds of assets, such as\nownership rights for cryptocurrencies as well as real-world assets like stock\nshares, real estate or even art. For some, the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs\nhelped boost the legitimacy of this technology, and now we\u2019re seeing more\nfirms and retail investors exploring the many benefits of\ntokenization.</p><p><b>You're reading</b><a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/\"><b> Crypto Long\n&amp; Short</b></a><b>, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and\nanalysis for the professional investor.</b><a\nhref=\"https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/\"><b> Sign up\nhere</b></a><b> to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.</b></p><p>With\ntokenization, firms could be more capital-efficient, create new business\nmodels and more easily expand product offerings and distribution channels.\nFirms could unlock new efficiencies and uncover ways to streamline existing\nprocesses while finding new markets and ways of unlocking liquidity \u2013 and they\ncan likely do it cheaper and faster.</p><p>At the same time, tokenization\ncould revolutionize the way transactions are processed. Take securities\nlending for example. With tokenization, collateral could be exchanged in real\ntime, enabling firms to lower the risk of their existing processes. Managing a\nsecurities lending pool using smart contracts, or transactions that\nautomatically execute when certain conditions are met, could also unlock\nefficiencies by embedding compliance within tokens, paving the way to 24/7\ntrading \u2013 without the need for a network of trading desks around the\nworld.</p><p>These benefits, however, are just the tip of the iceberg. The\nreal promise of blockchain technology lies in the assets themselves. Consider\nhow assets operate today. Various systems are needed to run vital processes\nsuch as pricing an asset, distributing interest and dividends, and\ncommunicating with investors. With tokenization, we could incorporate these\nprocesses into the asset itself. Given a tokenized asset is capable of\nexecuting automated processes on its own, we could eliminate the need for\npotentially dozens of systems working behind the scenes.</p><p>If the benefits\nare so tangible, why haven\u2019t we seen more widespread adoption in the financial\nservices industry? Mainly because we are somewhat still in the infancy stage\naround this technology, and policymakers are still assessing the landscape and\nconsidering the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.</p><p>There are\nalso concerns about counterparty risk, finality of settlement, and control\nlocations, not to mention a lack of standards and taxonomy. More\nphilosophically, digital asset owners want to ensure that their ownership\nrights will be preserved in the absence of a tangible asset they can hold in\ntheir hand.</p><p>At the same time, the industry\u2019s approach to innovation\ncontinues in siloes and represents another roadblock to adoption. In 2023,\nnearly three out of four projects involving distributed ledger technology\n(DLT) had fewer than seven participants, according to <a\nhref=\"https://issanet.org/content/uploads/2016/02/2019_11_ISSA_Report_Crypto_Assets_Moving_from_Theory_to_Practice.pdf\"><u>a\nstudy</u></a> from the International Securities Services Association (ISSA).\nOf course, it\u2019s encouraging to see firms dive in and explore DLT. However, if\ninnovation continues in silos, one of the core promises offered by\ntokenization will be missed: creating broad efficiencies across the\nindustry.</p><p>The answer here is simple: let\u2019s work together. Experiments\nshould have a shared infrastructure. There should be many participants\nrepresenting the financial industry\u2019s wide range of stakeholders. There\u2019s\nmutual benefit to be found here. Together, we can lay the foundation for\nsuccessful experimentation in sandboxes with initiatives that expand upon each\nother incrementally and create an ecosystem that\u2019s scalable and works for all\ncounterparties.</p><p>Collaboration would also help ensure digital assets\nthrive within a well-regulated framework, with standardized governance that\nreduces risks and costs. In addition, collaboration could facilitate\nconnectivity by improving optionality and the choice of platforms, ultimately\nimproving the way digital assets interact with traditional securities and\npayment infrastructures.</p><p>But before all of this, firms must look inward\nto realize the full potential of tokenization. There\u2019s no one size-fits-all\napproach, and every organization has its own, unique business model. More and\nmore firms from across the industry are sitting down and thinking through what\ntokenization means for them. How can it revolutionize their business and the\nway it serves their clients?</p><p>In the end, the value of tokenization is\ndirectly correlated to the strength of a firm\u2019s imagination. We are only\nlimited by our creativity in the way we\u2019re able to reimagine business and\noperating models, and the way tokenization could unlock new opportunities.</p>\n]]>\n\n...\n\n</content:encoded>\n\n<media:content\nurl=\"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tR79kl9XzqPX4LwAse12v-O1HwM=/cloudfront-\nus-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/QZSVOSGT6BEQ3CI7COX62JUBJM.jpg\"\ntype=\"image/jpeg\" height=\"3430\" width=\"5145\"/>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTC-USD\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTC\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n<Metadata>\n\n<MetaDataType FormalName=\"Securities Identifier\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Ticker Symbol\" Value=\"BTCUSD=X\"/>\n\n<Property FormalName=\"Exchange\" Value=\"CCC\"/>\n\n...\n\n</Metadata>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n...\n\n</channel>\n\n...\n\n</rss>\n\n", "frontpage": false}
