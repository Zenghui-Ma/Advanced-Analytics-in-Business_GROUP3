The simplest tasks, like collaborating on\ncontent and responding to feedback, can be a massive headache. More than ever,\nour customers need technology that makes teamwork effortless.\n\nUsing the lessons we\u2019ve learned from Virtual First, our playbook for\ndistributed work, we\u2019ve designed new tools that make it easier to find,\norganize, and share your content\u2014all in one secure place. Today, we\u2019re\nannouncing new top-requested features to give you the control, flexibility,\nand speed to do your best work, all from Dropbox.\n\n## Advanced data protection features add extra layers of security to\nconfidential content with seamless end-to-end encryption and advanced key\nmanagement\n\nFor years, Dropbox has been trusted by hundreds of millions of users to keep\ntheir most important content secure in a simple, seamless way that doesn\u2019t\nrequire custom configuration or complex steps. All customer files at rest are\nencrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standards so Dropbox users can be\nconfident their data is secure. Some teams, however, work with more sensitive\ninformation and want customized encryption standards or additional layers of\nsecurity to control their data and permissions.\n\nSo today, we\u2019re adding even more advanced data protection features, designed\nto be easy to use for all business teams. In addition to existing layers of\nsecurity for all Dropbox accounts, business teams will now have access to:\n\n  * Seamless end-to-end encryption: Safeguards data so only the sender and recipient can access content, which means no one\u2014not even Dropbox\u2014can get into those files. Seamless end-to-end encryption is now natively integrated into team folders and eliminates the need for additional software subscriptions.\n  * Advanced key management: Add an extra layer of security by setting up a unique encryption key managed by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 key management services, providing more protection and easier management of all team Dropbox files.\n\nWe\u2019re also introducing new tools to make it easier for admins to get vital\ninformation and visibility into team activity in one place:\n\n  * Improved Admin Experience: Manage team membership and invites from a central dashboard. Stay up-to-date on pending invites and license usage.\n  * Updated Trust Center: Simplify risk assessments of Dropbox products. Get self-serve, anytime access to information about security, reliability, privacy, and compliance, and complete internal reviews, audits, and risk assessments faster than ever.\n\nThe latest security features will be available to all Dropbox Advanced,\nBusiness Plus, and Enterprise customers starting today.

That\u2019s why we\nrecently launched an improved integration with Microsoft Teams that lets you\nsearch, preview, upload, and share content stored in Dropbox without leaving\nMicrosoft 365. With this update, you can also use our plugin extension for\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 to answer questions and generate summaries.\n\nToday, we're building on this with even more Microsoft integrations designed\nto simplify work for teams.\n\n  * Real-Time Co-Authoring (beta): One of Dropbox\u2019s most-requested features ever, Co-Authoring allows multiple team members to collaboratively edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files from desktop, web, and mobile, natively within Dropbox. You can also see who\u2019s in the document and where they\u2019re editing in real-time, so everyone is working off the latest version. Now teams can finally put an end to conflicting copies.\n  * Dropbox Replay for OneDrive: Bring media files from OneDrive directly into Replay for reviews and approvals.\n\nStarting today, all Dropbox customers can sign up for the Co-Authoring beta\nand access the Dropbox Replay for OneDrive integration. To sign up for the\nbeta and learn more about Dropbox and Microsoft, visit dropbox.com/app-\nintegrations/microsoft.\n\n## Find and get to work on content with quick view, quick access, suggested\nactions, and more on the Dropbox web experience\n\nLast October, we introduced a redesigned web experience in response to\ncustomer feedback for faster access to files. Today, we're introducing several\nmore improvements to help you quickly find what you need so you can start\ndoing your best work\u2014all in Dropbox.\n\nAll Dropbox customers will get access to new capabilities to:\n\n  * Easily preview a file as you navigate through your folders with quick view. You can now also identify what's inside a file or folder by hovering over it in grid view.\n  * Get to your favorite files quickly by pinning items within quick access in an updated left navigation bar.\n  * Kickstart work with suggested quick actions for files\u2014like editing a PDF\u2014that change based on how you work.\n\nCustomers on paid plans will get additional features like the ability to:\n\n  * Access content in fewer clicks with dynamic filters that automatically organize your content by things like by project name or themes.\n  * Find similar files faster with smart suggestions that show files related to what you\u2019re viewing, like similar PDFs.\n\nQuick view, quick access, and suggested quick actions will begin rolling out\nglobally today. Dynamic filters and smart suggestions are now rolling out to\npaid plan users in the U.S. in English only today.\n\nAnimation showing the quick view feature in the new Dropbox web experience.\n\n## Fast-track video, image, and audio reviews with new features in Dropbox\nReplay\n\nToday, video is the fastest-growing content-type on Dropbox, with over 1.5B\nvideos uploaded every year. We introduced Dropbox Replay, our rich media\nreview and approval tool, to help customers speed up video reviews and get to\nfinal delivery faster. For example, one Sundance film composer told us how\nReplay helped him streamline his review process and finish the score in less\nthan 20 days to meet the festival deadline. And we\u2019ve heard over and over from\ncustomers how helpful our patented live review feature is. In just a few\nclicks, you can start a live session to review audio and video files with\ncollaborators in real-time.\n\nWe\u2019ve also heard that, more than ever, customers are working across multiple\ncontent types and need a simple way to put their brand front and center.\nToday, we\u2019re introducing new capabilities to make it easier to do that:\n\n  * Added rich media support: Use Replay to review and approve more types of rich media, including PDF and PSD files.\n  * Avid Pro Tools integration: Enables teams to review comments on audio files within the Avid platform.\n  * Dynamic watermarking: Keep proprietary content protected and prevent unauthorized use by placing watermarks on work shared with collaborators. Watermarks include recipient email, IP address, date, and time when the file is opened.\n  * Custom branding: Configure custom images, banners, logos, and colors within Replay project workspaces.\n\nThe Avid Pro Tools integration and added rich media support are available\ntoday to all Replay customers. Customers who upgrade to the paid Replay add-on\ncan now also access dynamic watermarking and custom branding. To learn more,\nvisit dropbox.com/replay.\n\nEasily create personalized watermarks for every reviewer of your video\nprojects.\n\nAnimation showing the watermarking feature in Dropbox Replay.\n\n## Manage sensitive documents securely and get real-time deal insights with\nDocSend Advanced Data Rooms\n\nCustomers say they\u2019re spending too much time organizing deal files and sharing\nthem via email. Without analytics and integration across tools, it\u2019s hard to\ntell which information is resonating with stakeholders and challenging to keep\nfiles updated.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to introduce DocSend Advanced Data Rooms. They\u2019re\ndesigned to simplify the entire deal process from initial pitch to final\nsignature. With DocSend, businesses can offload administrative burdens and\nsecurely share the most impactful proprietary information faster, so teams\nhave more time to focus on closing deals.\n\n  * Conduct due diligence with confidence and control: Features like group permissions, visitor verification, and built-in NDAs give you precise control over your most sensitive information.\n  * Empower your team with real-time deal insights: Comprehensive data room analytics and page-by-page insights let your team make data-driven decisions.\n  * Create and organize your data rooms in minutes: Quickly put your best foot forward with features like data room templates, auto-indexing, and custom branding.\n\nTo learn about our transparent pricing and unlimited data rooms, visit\ndocsend.com/features/virtual-data-room/\n\n## Find what you need instantly across your digital workspace with Dropbox\nDash, AI-powered universal search\n\nWhen you\u2018re working across hundreds of tabs and apps between your desktop and\nbrowser, you can lose precious time trying to navigate to what you need. In\nfact, researchers found that people are switching between apps and sites\nnearly 1,200 times per day, which adds up to nearly four hours lost every\nweek. Why is it easier to search all of human knowledge than your own\ncompany\u2019s content?\n\nLast year, we set out to solve this problem by launching Dropbox Dash (beta),\nAI-powered universal search that connects tools, content, and apps in a single\nsearch bar. Dash interacts with the tools you use every day, so you can find\nanything from your workspace in seconds. Now, Dropbox is improving search and\nadding new capabilities based on customer feedback:\n\n  * Increased access to Dash: Dash is just a click away on desktop and web. And with an improved Desktop app, it\u2019s easier to find, organize, and share content.\n  * Redesigned Start Page: The Start Page, a single dashboard that lets you access universal search, view Stacks\u2014smart, shareable collections of content, and get shortcuts to recent work, offers a new experience that makes it simple to find content, fast. Dash now automatically groups different types of content into Stacks and displays them in a central hub.\n  * New connectors: Dash now connects to more than 20 tools and apps you use for work, including popular new additions like Microsoft OneNote and Zendesk\n\nDropbox Dash is currently in beta and only available in the U.S. in English\nwith new features starting to roll out today. To try out Dash, visit\ndash.dropbox.com.\n\nDropbox is committed to helping customers organize and share their most\nimportant content from one secure place.
