Context awareness mechanics introduced with Context Chat and Context Write\nlets the Assistant know even more about your work than you do. Worry not about\nprivacy \u2014 Assistant is itself a part of your Hub and doesn\u2019t send your data\nanywhere.\n\n### Nextcloud Teams \ud83e\uddd1\ud83e\udd1d\ud83e\uddd1\n\nShifting gears to teamwork, meet Nextcloud Teams \u2014 the next evolutionary leap\nfor Circles. Teams arrives in Hub with the new team overview, quick access to\nshared resources, and a dashboard widget. And we are only getting started!\n\n### Speedy new Mail \ud83d\ude84\n\nA hefty part of your day you spend in Mail. With Hub 8 we made it faster \u2014 so\nyou can go home earlier. The background sync is now twice as fast, the\nimproved UI ensures comfort for a smooth morning catching-up, while replying\ntakes less time with the addition of AI-powered suggestions.\n\n### Advanced Talk \ud83d\udcac\n\nReaching out to users from another Hub is a breeze with federated messaging in\nTalk. More on Talk features, we added message editing, sparing you the delete-\nand-rewrite dance. Many improvements come your way in conferencing too, making\npresenting and group calls more comfortable and efficient.\n\n### Optimized Files \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f\n\nHub 8 gets you to your files faster. Enjoy your private, clutter-free space\nwith a Personal files section. Share downloads with confidence using one-time\nlinks. Preview and edit files linked across Hub with new interactive widgets.\nDiscover optimized navigation for photos.\n\n### And so much more in Hub 8!\n\nBITV 2.0 certification, incredible improvements in Tables, more automation in\nForms, major performance updates in Office, and many other news are waiting\nfor you in Hub 8. Get it now to see for yourself, or buckle up as we lead you\nthrough every new feature you need to know about.\n\n## Take Nextcloud Hub 8 for a test drive\n\nExplore Nextcloud Hub 8 and try all of the core apps to unveil the potential\nof a collaboration platform trusted by tens of millions of users across the\nglobe.\n\nTry Hub 8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\n## Nextcloud Assistant 2.0\n\nBuild an efficient, sovereign, AI-powered workspace with Hub. Welcome\nNextcloud Assistant 2.0, new integrations and new AI deployment mechanics.\n\nAI features already available in Hub\n\n### Ask Assistant about your own assets \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\n\nHub 8 enables Nextcloud Assistant\u2019s new context awareness features. One of\nthem is Context Chat, a smart chat bot that can access your data and answer\nquestions about your documentation, contracts, papers, reports or anything\nelse. You can manually define the scope and even limit it to a specific folder\nor file for more precision.\n\nHere you can enter your prompt.\n\nYou can optionally choose what documents should be used\n\nAnd here are the results!`\n\nAnd it\u2019s not limited to Files: we developed an API that allows Assistant to\nlook into Mail, Calendar, Talk, Deck and other apps to fetch info about\nimportant meetings, tasks received via emails and chats, and any other data\nfrom those apps. Over the coming weeks and months, we are going to gradually\nimplement the Context Chat API across the Hub ecosystem, making Context Chat\never smarter.\n\n### Texts written your way with Context Write \ud83d\udcdd\n\nContext Write is another new feature of Nextcloud Assistant powered by context\nawareness. It can derive context from existing files to convey their unique\ntone, wording, and even structure to create new texts with the data you\nprovide. Tell the Assistant about your working experience and give it a nice\nCV file, and it will create a custom CV for you. Share meeting notes and ask\nit to write a formal report similar to your reference \u2013 done!\n\n### Generate Mail replies and automate events in Calendar \ud83d\udc8c\n\nWith Hub 8, we add more Assistant features to Groupware tools. Get reply\nsuggestions based on your conversation history in Mail. Create Calendar events\nfrom emails without leaving the Mail app, automatically generate event titles\nand descriptions, and even an agenda. Go ahead \u2013 take an extra coffee break!\n\n### Chat summaries in Talk \ud83c\udf61\n\nSummarization of team meetings and spontaneous brainstorms in Talk chats makes\nit easy to get a refresher on previous discussions. The new AI Talk bot can\nrecap your conversations, describe the discussed topics and define tasks based\non chat activity. Give it a preferred time to deliver the summary, and it will\nsend it in the chat when scheduled.\n\n### Prompt history and even more tools in Assistant \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nAssistant 2.0 gives you even more control. Access prompt history when you need\nto reuse your past prompts, and ask the Assistant to stop unfinished tasks if\nno longer needed. We also gave even more functionality to the Assistant,\nadding built-in image generation and speech to text features.\n\n### Synchronous tasks in Text \u23e9\n\nText now supports running Nextcloud Assistant tasks in a synchronous way. If\nyour AI provider is able to return the results fast enough, the Assistant can\ndeliver them in the window right away. If it takes longer, you can choose to\nrun the job on the background and get notified once it\u2019s done.\n\n### Assistant on-the-go \ud83d\udcf1\u2728\n\nAccess Assistant from any device on the go to draft texts, compose mail\nresponses and create social media messages \u2014 with Nextcloud Assistant now\navailable in mobile clients.\n\n### Ready for mission-critical deployment\n\nWe know that AI works miracles when it comes to automation: it can make your\nwork easier, save your time and hopefully get you back to your family and\nfriends sooner each day. But we\u2019re also aware of its downsides, some similar\nto the challenges brought about by the big tech firms, some unique to AI.\n\nThey say sunlight is the best disinfectant. We want to offer you the best of\nAI, but also provide transparency and choice. You\u2019re the one who decides where\nand how to use AI in Nextcloud and equally how to balance its benefits with\nprivacy, environmental impact, and more.\n\nMore about our approach to AI and Ethical AI Rating\n\n### Building sovereign AI in collaboration with the German government\n\nNextcloud teamed up with the government of German state Schleswig-Holstein to\nbuild sovereign AI tools for state administration needs. This will allow the\nstate office to amplify process automation, create value for domestic digital\neconomy, and notably set an example for AI strategy building within public\nsectors in Europe and beyond.\n\n## Interactive widgets\n\nNo more jumping between apps. With Hub 8, we introduce the ultimate shortcut.\n\nEdit meeting notes in a Talk chat while video conferencing, scroll through a\nproject Deck board on a Collectives page, or add a whole interactive calendar\nto your planning file in Text \u2014 you name it. With interactive widgets in Hub,\nyou can quite literally embed one app into another.\n\nHub 8 supports interactive widgets for files, folders, Deck boards and\ncalendars. You can paste widgets in Talk chats, Collectives pages, Text files,\nand Deck card descriptions.\n\n### View and edit files \ud83d\udc40\n\nUsing widgets, you and other users with access can view the linked file\ncontents and make edits without leaving the app. To prevent accidental edits,\nfile widgets in Talk open in view-only mode by default.\n\nEmbedded Vimeo VideoBy loading the video, you agree to Vimeo's privacy policy\nand Nextcloud's privacy policy.Link to the video:\nhttps://vimeo.com/932822623/38a4a89ba5/\n\nBy playing this video, all Vimeo videos will be unblocked\n\nFile editing in Talk with interactive widget\n\n### Embedded Calendars \ud83d\udcc5\n\nNow you can embed a full calendar in many Hub apps to quickly browse events,\ndates, and schedules. Respecting your privacy, Nextcloud only shows the\nembedded calendar to users with access, while for others it will remain blank.\n\n### Integrated Deck boards \ud83d\udca1\n\nManage tasks and deadlines anywhere in Hub. Paste a Deck board to browse the\ncontents, open and manage the cards, and even access search and settings.\n\n## Nextcloud Office\n\nBetter team and project management in Office. Even more automated, even more\nconnected, and even more collaborative.\n\n### Manage like a pro with Teams \ud83d\udc65\n\nNextcloud Teams is a new step for Circles, with a redesigned team overview, a\nDashboard widget, and new features to streamline team management. Browse team\nresources like Deck boards, Talk rooms and Collectives in the team menu. Add\nnew items to share them in an instant. Shared files and calendars are coming\nsoon.\n\n### Publicly share Collectives pages \ud83d\udcd6\n\nSharing knowledge with Collectives is now easier, as we take a lot of extra\nactions off your shoulders. Share individual Collectives pages with included\nsub-pages via public links. Manage all link shares via sidebar Share tab.\nCreate multiple links with individual permissions to improve security when\nsharing externally.\n\n### Link Forms to sheets \ud83d\udd17\n\nLink forms to spreadsheets to automatically submit collected data to ODS,\nXLSX, or CSV files. Re-export, create new sheet copies and edit the linked\nsheets to add more columns with comments, statuses and any other data you\nneed.\n\n### Spreadsheets: cell protection, tooltips, and improved filtering\n\nNew features in spreadsheets aim to boost security and integrity of your\nspreadsheets and greatly improve overall usability. Cell protection allows\npreventing unwanted changes in selected cells, intentional or not, and\nmanaging individual permissions for cells. When typing a function name, a\ntooltip will show you relevant functions to assist you in search. Filtering\nhas been improved with the AutoFilter feature and new filtering options like\nColor and Condition.\n\n### Documents: layout improvements, better navigation and change tracking\n\nKeep the layout of your documents neat with dedicated section editing,\nseparate headers and footers for pages under one style, and support for\nSTYLEREF fields. Browsing tracked changes is now easier thanks to popover\ntooltips and improved change highlights in tables.\n\n### Manage users you follow when collaborating\n\nIt\u2019s now easier to follow and unfollow users in your documents, spreadsheets\nand presentations. The currently followed user is directly visible, so you\nalways know whom you are following. Unfollowing became more convenient too:\njust click on the list to resume independent browsing.\n\nEmbedded Vimeo VideoBy loading the video, you agree to Vimeo's privacy policy\nand Nextcloud's privacy policy.Link to the video:\nhttps://vimeo.com/932821735/4d3665d759/\n\nBy playing this video, all Vimeo videos will be unblocked\n\n## More than just Tables\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Tables, a versatile data processing app in the Hub ecosystem\nthat elevates your workflow management. In Hub 8, we included improvements in\nTables navigation and data imports, as well as introduce a complete new\nmechanic: no-code apps based on Tables.\n\n### Build custom Tables apps \ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f\n\nNeed a custom app in your Hub to manage a process, centrally access project\ndata, or build a dedicated knowledge base? Now you can create custom Hub apps\nbased on Tables, streamlining management of individual teams, projects, or\nprocesses. Aggregate and combine existing tables and views and add them as a\nnew application to the menu bar for quick access.\n\n### Navigate your tables in a pinch \ud83d\udd26\n\nAll tables are accessible from a single list that you can filter to find the\nmost relevant items quickly. Add tables to favorites to keep them on top of\nthe list at all times, or archive unused tables to clean your space without\nlosing old data.\n\n> With Nextcloud Tables, we\u2019re definitely getting to a point where we can\n> replace traditional specialized software, (German: Fachverfahren), by\n> storing the data structures in Nextcloud.\n>\n> Sven Thomson, CIO Schleswig-Holstein\n\n### New ways to import data \ud83d\udcca\n\nImport tables from external files using the upload feature or from the right\nclick menu from the Files app. We improved file parsing to automatically\ndetect more items from CSV and spreadsheet files, such as dates, percentage,\ncurrency and decimals.\n\n### Transfer ownership with ease \ud83e\udd1d\n\nNow users can change the owners of the tables themselves, making it easier to\nmanage tasks without admin permissions. The setting is available in the Edit\nwindow.\n\n## Nextcloud Files\n\nNew Files, featuring your personal file management space, better navigation,\nand even more ways to share.\n\n### Files, your own \ud83d\udcc2\n\nGetting lost in a massive amount of shared documents? Enjoy a clean space for\nyourself with the Personal files section to find all of your own files and\nfolders. Accessible from the web and Nextcloud clients, your documents,\ndrafts, photos, invoices and other items are always close at hand. Plus, we\nadded file recommendations to help you get to recently edited files faster.\n\n### One-time links and QR-codes \ud83d\udd17\n\nSharing is even more secure now with one-time download links. When you wish to\nshare a download with a single user and don\u2019t want the link passed around,\ncheck the corresponding box in the link settings. What\u2019s more, now you can\ngenerate QR-codes on the spot to share links with ease on web pages, slides,\nprinted materials, and more.\n\n### Pictures where you want them \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f\n\nIn Hub 8, we added one of the most anticipated features for the Photos app: a\ndedicated Media folder for all your pictures. Your space no longer shows those\nannoying memes your colleague keeps sending over, and instead displays photos\nfrom the chosen folder. Previews also run smoothly now with \u2018blur hash\u2019 so you\ncan scroll through your library more quickly.\n\n### Photos widget for Dashboard \ud83c\udf05\n\nWhile we were at it, we also created a nice Dashboard widget for Photos: it\nshows you a picture from the past. Good memories, we hope! \ud83c\udf1e\n\n## Nextcloud Talk\n\nMeet an optimized Talk with much smoother team meetings, Federated chatting,\nnew mechanics in messages including editing, Flavored Markdown and much more.\n\n### Message editing \ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f\n\nHere\u2019s to cleaner chat! Now you can edit messages in talk to correct typos,\nupdate information and add new lines without following up in a separate\nmessage. Edits are possible for 6 hours after the message is sent.\n\n### Federated chatting \ud83c\udf10\n\nFederated Hub becomes even more united. Now users from all teams can create\ngroup chats across federated Talk instances and use many Talk features like\nmentions, polls, and chat notifications. And even more to come in the future!\n\nFor federated chatting, we use the open standard Open Cloud Mesh (OCM)\ndeveloped at CERN with the help of Nextcloud and other open source projects.\nThe same standard is in use for federated file sharing. In the future, we are\nplanning to expand this into federated Calendar sharing and other features.\n\n### Smoother team meetings \ud83d\udcde\n\nNow you can drag the speaker video to pick the best position to fit shared\nscreen content. Current speaker is highlighted in the list for more visibility\nduring large group calls. Call UI is greatly improved: access chat\ndescriptions and post polls during calls, navigate chat messages without\ninterruptions, and more.\n\n### New text styles \ud83c\udfa8\n\nWith Flavored Markdown now supported in Talk, you can make your messaging even\nmore visually rich and informative. With syntax included in Flavored Markdown,\nyou can create tables, add interactive check boxes and format text as a\nstrikethrough.\n\nAbout using Markdown in Talk\n\n## Nextcloud Groupware\n\nIn Hub 8, we focused on improving the performance of the whole Groupware\nbundle, delivering faster Mail with notable design adjustments, more\nautomation and comfort in Calendar, better external compatibility, and more.\n\n### Faster, smarter, sleeker Mail\n\n#### Find the right words with reply suggestions \ud83d\udcac\n\nDon\u2019t have time to compose a well worded, professional reply? Hint: Use AI!\nNextcloud Assistant in Mail now generates reply suggestions for you, so you\ncan send a response to incoming mail based on your context in no time.\n\n#### Enjoy a much faster sync \ud83d\udd01\n\nIMAP accounts without CONDSTORE extension can now sync 2x faster to enjoy a\nmuch more agile Mail experience.\n\n#### Create events with automatic info i\ufe0f\n\nEnjoy even more automation! Now you can quickly create an event from the email\nthread using the More actions >> Create event action. Nextcloud Assistant will\nautomatically pick the event title and description, and even create an agenda\nbased on your conversation.\n\n### Save the date: Calendar improvements\n\n#### Redesigned event window \ud83d\udccd\n\nWe improved the event overview window and sidebar view, rendering a more\ncomfortable layout and introducing two window modes: View mode and Edit mode.\n\n#### Suggestions for free/busy times \u231a\ufe0f\n\nIn Nextcloud Mail, you can view the free/busy times of attendees to arrange\nthe best time for your meeting. What if the time slot you picked doesn\u2019t work\nfor everybody? In Hub 8, Calendar automatically suggests the next suitable\ntime slot on their availability and let\u2019s you adjust the event in one click.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in the redesigned availability window you can quickly manage the\nevent: change the event time or add and remove the attendees.\n\n## Nextcloud ecosystem\n\nTogether with the Hub 8 release, we roll out new features for external apps,\nadd new integrations, and amplify our whole app ecosystem with new mechanics.\n\n### Pop-up update summaries \ud83d\udd14\n\nThe change log pop-up feature enables you to deliver update summaries straight\nto your users in a form of a notification. List new features, bug fixes and\nimprovements and ship them in the appropriate format depending on the user\u2019s\nrole: admin or general user.\n\n### Discover in App Store \ud83d\udd0e\n\nThe new Discover section aims to create a more engaging experience for App\nStore users. It features curated app suggestions, themed collections, and\nvarious related content such as interviews, podcasts, and resources. To app\ndevelopers, it is also an opportunity to greatly amplify visibility of their\napps.\n\n### New integrations \ud83e\udde9\n\nPaperless-ngx is an open-source document management solution designed to help\nyou organize and navigate your paperwork with a variety of complimentary\nfeatures like OCR.\n\n  * Transform physical documents into a digital archive\n  * Organize and customize your library, enjoy advanced navigation\n  * Use a variety of extra features like OCR and Tesseract\n\nNew LLMs ready for integration\n\n#### NeuralBeagle14 7B\n\nIt is a 7B parameter model that uses a context window of 8k. It is compatible\nwith different templates like chatml and Llama\u2019s chat template. It is good at\ninstruction following and reasoning tasks and can be used for RP and\nstorytelling.\n\n#### Smaug-72b\n\nThe Smaug-72B model is a significant advancement in open-source language model\ndevelopment. It is a powerful large-scale language model that excels in\nreasoning and math tasks.\n\n### Build apps for Nextcloud! \ud83e\uddd1\ud83d\udcbb\n\nWhether you want to create mobile apps that connect to Nextcloud, integrate\nindependent apps in Hub, or build dedicated apps, we\u2019ve got you covered! You\ncan build applications in any programming language, make use of our complete\nAPI documentation, and follow ready tutorials to get inspired.\n\nSpeaking of which, we are constantly extending our library of app tutorials,\nand this time we added two awesome new guides: a hello world app tutorial and\na guide to using Github Codespaces as a developer environment.\n\n### New app ecosystem features \ud83c\udf0f\n\nThe app ecosystem update gives new liberties to app developers. With\ndeclarative syntax, now you can define custom setting screens for admins and\nend users. Opening opportunities for deeper integration with Nextcloud, we\nmade it possible to inject a full user interface in Nextcloud. To aid the\ncontributing developers in localization efforts, we also let you get help from\nour translator community using Transifex.\n\n## Nextcloud Clients\n\nWe worked on Nextcloud clients for all platforms, adding some great features\nto extend functionality and improve performance.\n\n### VFS support in macOS app\n\nWith Hub 8, we are releasing a new client for macOS that has support for the\nVirtual File System (VFS). The new sync engine adds more agility to file\nbrowsing, presenting all of the files available on the server without\ndownloading them and taking extra disk space. These files will only be\ndownloaded when you need to interact with them.\n\n### Easier app updates on Windows\n\nGreat news for our Windows users: new versions of the desktop client can now\nbe installed without user intervention in most cases, making the update\nprocess smooth without disrupting your work.\n\n### MDM in the Android app\n\nEnterprise customers will be glad to read that the Android app now has Mobile\nDevice Management (MDM) integrated. The feature allows you to manage the\nmobile devices connected to your Nextcloud and therefore greatly improve\nsecurity controls.\n\n### Design improvements for iOS client\n\niOS client for Files received major design rework in many areas:\n\n  * Cleaner navigation bar with new dropdown menu\n  * New account switcher\n  * Ability to show/hide the description\n  * Optimized action sheet\n  * Improved grid view for files\n  * Improved icons throughout the app\n\n## BITV 2.0 certified Nextcloud Enterprise \u2705\n\nNextcloud Enterprise has been awarded a German BITV 2.0 certification that is\nbased on WCAG 2.0 benchmark. This means that the enterprise and public sector\nusers can be confident in the accessibility standards of Nextcloud.\n\nThe platform is designed with all users\u2019 needs in mind, suitable for people\nwith limitations and requirements for non-standard input devices and\nadditional measures like a screen reader.\n\nOur work done to obtain this certification shows our commitment to offer\nbarrier-free technology to everyone. Customers who require the certification\nshould contact their sales representative.\n\n## New level of performance\n\nOrganizations big and small rely on Nextcloud to supercharge their\ncollaboration. That\u2019s why we take performance and stability very seriously.\nEfficient software is not only about getting things done fast and serving a\nlarge base of users, it is also about reducing energy consumption and running\non diverse infrastructures without losing efficiency.\n\nNextcloud Hub 8 Performance keynote by Jos Poortvliet\n\nWith this release, we started working on the Database Sharding which lets you\nsplit Nextcloud database into several smaller databases and to distribute it\namong a few smaller servers. The basis for Database Sharding is already here,\nand we are planning to work on it moving forward to bring the opportunity to\nour users.\n\nAnother noteworthy improvement is in continuous work on the Read-After-Write\nbehavior. Current architecture requires synchronous replication, which reduces\nthe number of database cluster nodes to 4. In the future, we will support an\nunlimited number of Read nodes that are using asynchronous replication.\n\nThese efforts in boosting Nextcloud performance will allow us to accommodate\nup to 10x more users within a single cluster, moving the scalability of\nNextcloud to a whole new level.\n\nThis, and numerous smaller but meaningful updates in the frontend make the\nNextcloud experience much smoother, not only tackling the challenges of the\nlarge setups but also improving the performance for every user. After all,\nit\u2019s all about giving you more time, achieved with scrutiny of every detail.\n\n## Nextcloud One: a fully managed cloud platform\n\nNextcloud One is a fully managed Nextcloud offering.

You can switch to the beta channel\ntemporarily if you want to try the new Hub right away. Don\u2019t forget to switch\nback to stable after you\u2019ve updated to Hub 8!\n\nNote: Nextcloud caches the results coming from our updater server, so it can\ntake some time for the new version to show up and you likely have to refresh\nthe page, wait a bit, then try again.\n\n## How to update: AIO users\n\nFor new Nextcloud All-in-One (AIO) users, you can install Hub 8 directly by\nchecking the \u201cInstall Nextcloud 29\u201d box.\n\nWe have a dedicated setup guide for AIO users. Follow the guidelines to easily\nset up Hub 8.\n\nThe Nextcloud Enterprise version of Hub 8 will become available soon, once we\nsuccessfully run the additional testing and complete certification.\n\n## Thank you to our community! \ud83d\udc99\n\nNextcloud runs on community power. Users, contributors and developers who\ndedicate themselves to making Nextcloud better every day are the life force\nthat drives our project.
