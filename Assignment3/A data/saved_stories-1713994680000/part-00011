Liquid cooling\noffers 3,000 times the heat absorption of air, but to roll it out in a data\ncenter requires either a massive retrofit, or building a whole new facility\nfrom scratch to handle things like piping and special equipment.\n\nNeuCool fits into traditional racks ranging from the standard 42U size to more\nthan 50U with no special rack mounting required. It especially benefits older\nsystems, since most new servers being introduced into data centers today are\npreconfigured for deployment, and more and more are being sold with liquid\ncooling connectors.\n\nFor older air-cooled systems, the heat sinks and fans are replaced by NeuCool\nCPU and GPU Vaporators, which affix to the same location and footprint as the\nheat sinks and fans. The plumbing for vapor and liquid dielectric is also\npredetermined and integrated in advance. So, the new NeuCool Vaporators are\nintegrated and validated prior to server deployments.\n\nThe vaporators (also called cold plates) are mounted directly to targeted hot-\nspot chips. An eco-friendly dielectric refrigerant is used to draw heat away\nfrom the chip, where it turns into a vapor. That vapor then travels through an\nindustrial manifold to an intelligent Platform Control Unit (iPCU), condensing\nback into a liquid in a closed-loop system and returning to the vaporator for\ncontinued cooling.\n\nThe NeuCool architecture is heavily engineered to prevent leakage, which is a\nfear many people have when it comes to adopting liquid cooling. NeuCool\u2019s\nmodular design enables seamless integration into existing data center\nfacilities and at the edge via water-cooled doors, dry coolers or other heat\nrejection methods.\n\nAccelsius claims that its NeuCool two-phase, direct-to-chip, in-rack solution\noffers a solution for cooling challenges with an estimated 50% savings in\nenergy costs, an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions, and zero water used when\ncompared to air cooling.\n\nThe company is taking orders now, with deployments planned to begin later this\nmonth.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * news\n\n#### Nvidia supercomputers: new collegiate, research systems come online\n\nGeorgia Tech's dedicated AI supercomputer is a cluster of 20 Nvidia HGX H100s;\nthe DOE's Venado is the first large-scale system with Nvidia Grace CPU\nsuperchips deployed in the U.S.\n\nBy Andy Patrizio\n\nApr 24, 2024 3 mins\n\nSupercomputers Data Center\n\n  * news\n\n#### Intel announces edge AI processors\n\nNew edge-optimized processors and FPGAs will power AI-enabled devices in\nvertical industries including retail, industrial and healthcare.\n\nBy Andy Patrizio\n\nApr 18, 2024 3 mins\n\nCPUs and Processors Edge Computing\n\n  * news\n\n#### Nvidia, Google Cloud team to boost AI startups\n\nPlus, Google unveils Axion, its custom Arm-based chip for data centers, at\nGoogle Cloud Next 2024.\n\nBy Andy Patrizio\n\nApr 11, 2024 3 mins\n\nCPUs and Processors Google Cloud Next\n\n  * news\n\n#### Mainframe turns 60 with no plans for retirement\n\nDecades after some predicted its demise, the mainframe is as vital as ever,\neven in the era of AI.\n\nBy Andy Patrizio\n\nApr 10, 2024 3 mins\n\nMainframes Data Center\n\n  * PODCASTS\n  * VIDEOS\n  * RESOURCES\n  * EVENTS\n\nNEWSLETTERS\n\n### Newsletter Promo Module Test\n\nDescription for newsletter promo module.\n\nby Andy Patrizio\n\nAndy Patrizio is a freelance journalist based in southern California who has\ncovered the computer industry for 20 years and has built every x86 PC he\u2019s\never owned, laptops not included.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not\nnecessarily represent those of ITworld, Network World, its parent, subsidiary\nor affiliated companies.\n\n## Most popular authors\n\n  * Maria Korolov\n\nContributing writer\n\n  * Maria Korolov\n\nContributing writer\n\n  * Anirban Ghoshal\n\nSenior Writer\n\n#### Show me more\n\nhow-to\n\n#### Using the apropos command on Linux\n\nBy Sandra Henry-Stocker\n\nApr 24, 20243 mins\n\nLinux\n\nnews\n\n#### 2024 global network outage report and internet health check\n\nBy Ann Bednarz\n\nApr 24, 202438 mins\n\nInternet Service ProvidersNetwork Management SoftwareCloud Computing\n\nnews\n\n#### Accelsius offers liquid cooling without a data center retrofit\n\nBy Andy Patrizio\n\nApr 24, 20243 mins\n\nEnergy EfficiencyData Center\n\npodcast\n\n#### Has the hype around \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 paid off? | Ep. 145\n\nApr 18, 202436 mins\n\nIoT PlatformsIoT Security\n\npodcast\n\n#### Episode 1: Understanding Cisco\u2019s Converged SDN Transport\n\nSep 24, 202120 mins\n\nCisco SystemsInternetNetworking\n\npodcast\n\n#### Episode 2: Pluggable Optics and the Internet for the Future\n\nSep 23, 202117 mins\n\nOptical DrivesCisco SystemsInternet\n\nvideo\n\n#### Has the hype around \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 paid off?\n\nApr 18, 202436 mins\n\nIoT PlatformsInternet of Things\n\nvideo\n\n#### Are unused IPv4 addresses a secret gold mine?\n\nJan 11, 202435 mins\n\nIPv6Network Management SoftwareNetworking\n\nvideo\n\n#### Preparing for a 6G wireless world: Exciting changes coming to the\nwireless industry\n\nNov 07, 202330 mins\n\n5GShort-range Wireless\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 IDG Communications, Inc.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
