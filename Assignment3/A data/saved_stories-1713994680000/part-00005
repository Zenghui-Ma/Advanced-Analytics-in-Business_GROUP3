They\nsmell sales from five miles away. They cherish a clean inbox, unsubscribing\nright and left.\n\nBut email marketing still works for developer tools. You can accomplish\ntangible business goals using email automation:\n\n  * Establish an emotional connection between your customers and your team\n  * Communicate product quality and industry leadership\n  * Convert free users into paying customers at a better rate\n  * Upsell users to higher plans\n  * Reduce the amount of support during onboarding\n  * Showcase hidden \"delighter\" features\n  * Get in touch with top-performing customers, at scale\n  * Get more word-of-mouth growth\n\nBest of all, you can put this on autopilot \u2014 even \"set-and-forget\" \u2014 and scale\nthese communications to thousands of new users as your SaaS company grows.\nThis works wonders for high-volume models like freemium or open-source.\n\nIt's all about the \"how.\"\n\nHow do you market to developers while keeping your face and customer loyalty?\nWhat emails can you send so that your users want to stay subscribed?\n\nLet's unpack the tactics in this guide.\n\nModern developer tools like Grafbase, Flightcontrol, SpinupWP, Honeybadger,\nUrlbox, and Multi are using Userlist for their marketing and lifecycle emails.\nCare to join and unlock the growth benefits of email marketing? Book your demo\ncall.\n\n## Developers don't want to be sold to. Or do they?\n\nYuliya Tikhokhod of Hyperskill looked at their team chat for specific things\nshared by developers. Among them she found:\n\n  * A product promo featuring Microsoft Clippy (shared memory, vintage chic)\n  * A 100-day AI challenge that started on a specific date (urgency, trending topic)\n  * A long-overdue platform update that apparently had problems (cool news, negative gossip)\n  * Private beta invites to a new browser (exclusive access)\n\nAs Yuliya says:\n\n> \"There's nothing new under the sun. Developers share stuff for the same old\n> reasons \u2014 this is cool, this is exclusive, I need this right now.\"\n\nThat's why industry stereotypes shouldn't prevent you from marketing to\ndevelopers. The following is true for any audience:\n\n  1. Everybody is perceptive to marketing.\n  2. Nobody likes bad marketing.\n\nMichael Ludden of Turso says:\n\n> \"We say that developers are special, that they don't want to be sold to. The\n> fact is, nobody wants to be sold to.\"\n\nMoreover, you must borrow marketing tricks from other industries.\n\nBenedicte Raae, a developer advocate who has been serving many brands with\njoyful streaming content, shares:\n\n> \"It's a misconception that developers cannot be sold to. Their favorite\n> influencers follow the same marketing playbooks as lifestyle bloggers.\n> Except dev-fluencers are 6-12 months behind. You want to learn new things?\n> Follow the mommy bloggers. Mommy bloggers are the best.\"\n\n## Key principles for marketing to developers\n\n### Be transparent, especially about the edge cases\n\nProduct marketers from other industries may sugar-coat and overpromise.\n\nWith engineers, you don't have this luxury. They will investigate your edge\ncases and hold you accountable for any cover-up. The sauce is in the details,\nso talk about these details upfront.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  * Never overpromise and underdeliver.\n  * Share the edge cases upfront.\n\n### Be quirky or even ugly\n\nSure, there are brands like Vercel or Stripe who thrive on shipping delightful\npolished things. But it's much easier to stand out if you don't follow the\nenterprise stylebook.\n\nDo you know that YouTubers hold their microphones these days? (Thanks to\nBenedicte for sharing this video. Yes, it's one hour long.)\n\nYou want to be like them. This can take different forms:\n\n  * Pick a mascot like PostHog's hedgehog, Honeybadger's \u2014 ahem \u2014 honeybadger, or PostgreSQL's elephant\n  * Use quirky illustrations (check out this bestiary by Honeybadger)\n  * Send extra short or extra long emails\n  * Post unpolished videos\n  * Express edgy opinions\n  * Use edgy language\n\n### Help readers stay up to date\n\nTechnology is evolving at 10x speed these days. Your readers will appreciate\nit if you help them stay up to date. This is one of the key reasons why they\nwant to stay subscribed.\n\nIn your emails, include:\n\n  * Your own product updates\n  * News from companies, individuals, and organizations/foundations (especially in open source)\n  * Security updates\n  * Community discussions\n  * Industry gossip\n  * Quality content from other sources\n  * Anything else that's entertaining or helpful\n\nOur CTO Benedikt highlights the importance of open source news:\n\n> \"The open source aspect is a big one. Stripe's developer newsletter always\n> contains posts about open source libraries by the community.\"\n\n### Share deep content\n\nGeneric articles are a dime a dozen (let's not even start on the AI-generated\ncontent). Dig deeper, and you'll find that very few sources publish \"the good\nstuff.\"\n\nYou want to be one of these sources.\n\nThis means investing in the hard, \"meaty\" things: relevant examples, good\nstories. Our favorite approach is to collect the material first. Gather your\nexamples and stories, and then craft your narrative around it.\n\n### Respect their inbox\n\nTechnical audiences know precisely how email marketing works, and are great at\nspotting unsolicited subscriptions and noisy senders.\n\nUnless a user is being actively onboarded or going through an educational\ncourse, your sending cadence should be every 2-4 weeks (or even less\nfrequently). This means, roll up your updates into newsletters, and only use\ndedicated broadcasts to announce the most important features (this can take\nthe form of individual launch emails, email sequences, or even \"launch\nweeks\").\n\nJosh Wood of Honeybadger shares:\n\n> \"Developers don't hate email. But they do hate repetitive, irrelevant,\n> and/or uninteresting email. I think that's an opportunity, because the bar\n> is pretty low. We send a lot of onboarding emails (up to around 15 emails\n> over a 30-day trial), but they're segmented by trial activity so that if\n> you've already completed an activity, you don't get an email about it.\"\n\nHoneybadger also uses Userlist's subscription preferences to help customers\nmanage their topics instead of unsubscribing.\n\nBut don't swing into the opposite direction of \"no emails\" \u2014 your customers do\nexpect to hear from you.\n\nJonathan Markwell of Urlbox, a website screenshot API, shares:\n\n> \"I appreciate it when they email me at least once per month. Often I'll sign\n> up to a free plan or trial in the hope that I'll get a reminder about the\n> service in a few months when I'm ready to use it.\"\n\n### Give more context & remind them who you are\n\nLast but not least: developers get loads of emails from different platforms.\nYou want to give them more context, remind them the name of your product, and\nwhat problem it solves.\n\nJonathan Markwell shares his frustration as a developer and CTO at multiple\ncompanies over the last 20 years:\n\n> \"Too many companies fail to give me a one sentence reminder of what the tool\n> does in the emails they send. It's an extra leap for me to go and try\n> figuring it out from their website.\"\n\n### Leverage the authority of individuals\n\nThis is true for all industries, but especially true for \"authentic\"\nengineering content. Michael Christofides, our customer success engineer,\nshares:\n\n> \"In devtools it's not just companies. Some of the best stuff comes from\n> individuals.\"\n\nFrom my own experience: it was way easier to run my mailing list for UI\nBreakfast as a solo consultant in the past, compared to running a mailing list\non behalf of Userlsit. Same effort brings better results if it comes from a\nhuman.\n\nHow can you leverage this principle for your devtools marketing?\n\n  * Leverage the authority of your founder (think Karri Saarinen of Linear and his social media presence)\n  * Leverage the authority of your dev rel person (or developer advocate), if you have one\n  * Partner up with influencers in your field\n\nYou'll see the same principle in practice as companies use people's names in\nthe \"from\" field.\n\n## What goes into the \"from\" field?\n\nEmail is a powerful channel for creating direct conversations between the\naudience and your team. Michael of Turso says:\n\n> \"I try to be that invisible hand that connects the customers with the\n> CEO/CTO. I always sign with the name of the CEO/CTO, and try to match their\n> voice and tone.\"\n\nThese devtools follow the pattern:\n\n  * Supabase: \"Ant Wilson\", \"Ant from Supabase\" (Co-Founder & CTO)\n  * PlanetScale: \"Taylor Barnett\" (Staff Developer Advocate), \"Nick Van Wiggeren\" (VP of Engineering)\n  * AppSignal: \"Nuala from AppSignal\" (Nuala Doyle, Customer Success)\n\nSome brands prefer to keep it to just a brand name:\n\n  * Vercel: \"Vercel\"\n  * Linear: \"Linear\"\n  * Stripe: \"Stripe\"\n\nFor transactional emails, like notifications or password resets, nearly all\nbrands default to their brand name (\"Supabase\", etc).\n\n## Email formatting ideas for developer audience\n\n### Use plain-text emails\n\nPlain-text emails are the new (or not so new?) hot thing. This doesn't mean\nsending entirely flat emails in monospace font; you can still apply a bit of\nstyling. The point is to keep your words front-and-center.\n\nTuple's welcome email is super-simple, but it does the job well.\n\nSubject: Planning to try a Tuple call?\n\n### Use full links\n\nAnother thing we've noticed in developer emails: authors often prefer full-\ntext links over anchor text or buttons. This shows off the beauty and the\nsemantics of the URL, and gives you a heads-up on the final destination (as\nemail marketing platforms redirect the links for click tracking).\n\nHere's AppSignal sharing links to their resources:\n\nLinear displays a beautiful simple link to drive signups to their private\nbeta:\n\n### Use diagrams to illustrate technical concepts\n\nSometimes screenshots are not enough to get your message across. For these\nspecial occasions, invest in diagrams.\n\nIn the example below, PlanetScale uses a diagram to showcase their non-\nblocking schema changes feature \u2014 one of their unique selling points.\n\nSubject: Branch your database like your code\n\n### Include code snippets\n\nWhen the context calls for it, don't hesitate to include code snippets. In the\nexample below, AppSignal shows how to run a report.\n\nSubject: Step two: Install/debug AppSignal\n\nOr you can see how Stytch showcases their webhooks structure using a code\nsnippet.\n\n### Share keyboard shortcuts\n\nEmail is perfect for letting your users know about hidden \"delighter\"\ncapabilities of your platform \u2014 like keyboard shortcuts. You can use\nformatting to make these shortcuts stand out in the email body.\n\nSee this example from Linear:\n\n## Do things for fun\n\nSome things don't serve a practical purpose but create moments of joy: quirky\ncopy, an entertaining feature, or an easter egg. Try these things for an\nenergy boost. Actually, it's multiple boosts: one for your team as they're\ncreating it, and one for your users.\n\nIn the example below, the Linear team talks about their new emoji feature.\nCompletely unnecessary, but charming.\n\nWhen creating new accounts, Vercel provides you with a three-word security\ncode. However, they put extra thought into architecting these phrases.\n\nThis particular combination made me smile:\n\n## Newsletter is king. What makes a good one?\n\nAs we've mentioned above, you want to respect your reader's inbox. Therefore,\nmost of your content will go into your newsletters. First, let's take a\ngeneral look at how popular brands do theirs. Then we'll look into individual\ncomponents that comprise these newsletters.\n\nHere's what the newsletter from PlanetScale looks like.\n\nSubject: \ud83d\ude80 PlanetScale February newsletter\n\nSupabase sends out a \"Supa Update\" every month.\n\nSubject: Supa Update February 2024\n\nVercel sends out a product newsletter every month, known for their crisp\nvisual style.\n\nSubject: Vercel February Product Update\n\nNow let's dissect those newsletters into specific blocks. What sections can\nyou include to provide maximum value so that your customers stay subscribed?\n\n### Blog highlights\n\nIf blog content is your jam, make sure to highlight your latest articles in\nthe newsletter.\n\nPlanetScale includes article titles and descriptions:\n\nVercel includes a simple bulleted list of their recent posts\n\n### \"Made with\" section\n\n\"Made with\" section is a powerful method to provide social proof, show your\nproduct in action, and employ FOMO \u2014 all at the same time. (If we talk about\nother industries, Figma is known for doing it for designers.)\n\nHere's how Supabase does it:\n\n### Industry news and reports\n\nStytch\n\nNetlify shares their massive \"State of Web Development\" report with their\nmailing list.\n\nIf you want to do a report like that for your company, listen to this\ninterview with Becky Lawlor on survey-based research projects. Such projects\nare a great way to create industry authority and build organic links.\n\nSubject: New dev report, features, and integrations\n\n### Educational resources\n\nInvesting in courses or training materials like courses, workshops, and\nwebinars? Make sure to highlight them in your newsletters.\n\nHere's how PlanetScale promotes their Database Scaling course.\n\n### Videos and podcasts\n\nMany devtool brands are investing in high-quality media content like podcasts\nor videos. You can include them in your newsletters, or send out new episodes\nas individual emails.\n\nIf you send out regular emails with new episodes, make sure to use\nsubscription preferences so that readers can unsubscribe from this topic.\n\nHere's PlanetScale featuring their latest videos.\n\n### Community highlights\n\nThis is another way of building the spirit for your brand.\n\nSupabase dedicates a section of their newsletter to community highlights:\n\nStytch shares different ways to get in touch with them, including their Slack\ncommunity:\n\n## Product updates: your safest bet\n\nProduct updates are the most innocent and value-based way of getting in touch\nwith your audience (without feeling like a salesperson). You're not selling\nyour product, you're selling the value of a particular feature.\n\n### New feature announcements\n\nBigger features warrant a dedicated feature announcement email. Moreover,\nbrands like Supabase or Timescale are known for their \"launch weeks\" \u2014 or even\nmonths!\n\nHere's an email from Netlify talking about their blobs feature. See how\nthey're using a cute illustration as a banner:\n\n### Integrations\n\nIntegrations are a special breed of feature updates. They carry special value\nin the developer world.\n\nHere\u2019s Vercel showcasing a list of their recent AI integrations:\n\n### Changelog\n\nIt\u2019s common to promote one big feature, and then include changelog notes at\nthe end of the same email.\n\nHere\u2019s a changelog section from Netlify:\n\nAnd a changelog section from Vercel:\n\n## What types of lifecycle emails can you send?\n\nNow let's walk through the most popular lifecycle situations when you can get\nin touch with your users.\n\n### Welcome email\n\nEven companies with no email marketing still send a welcome email. This is\nyour way to greet users, give them context about your product, and help them\ntake the first steps.\n\nLinear's welcome email is a classic, well-rounded example.\n\nSubject: Welcome to Linear\n\nAppSignal sends a minimalist first email with a few helpful links:\n\nSupabase\u2019s first email is also on the leaner side.\n\nSubject: Welcome to Supabase\n\n### Upgrade to paid\n\nIn the freemium model \u2014 a #1 choice for devtools \u2014 your biggest financial ROI\nis in converting free users into paying customers. You can do this with a good\nupgrade email.\n\nHere's how Vercel offers their free users to try a Pro plan.\n\nSubject: Your personal Vercel account\n\nOr here's another example.\n\nThe AppSignal team is asking their customer to upgrade to a higher paid plan\nbased on usage. Note how they're including specific numbers to support the\nrequest.\n\nSubject line: Time for a bigger plan: an upgrade is due for the [company name]\norganization\n\n### Ask for feedback\n\nWhen it's time to collect user feedback, email is your best friend. You can\neither send a dedicated broadcast to a certain segment of users, or include\nfeedback request emails into your evergreen lifecycle campaigns.\n\nHere's how PlanetScale asks their users for feedback.\n\nSubject: PlanetScale feedback?\n\n### Account reactivation\n\nReactivation (re-engagement) emails are perfect for recovering inactive\naccounts. For devtools, it's a great reason to contact your users and give\nthem a heads-up that their account can be snoozed or deactivated.\n\nSupabase sends this short email to everyone who has been inactive for more\nthan 7 days \u2014 which is not a lot of time! They're not waiting for the account\nto go too cold.\n\nSubject: Your Supabase Instance\n\n### Sunsetting features\n\nSometimes you'll be sunsetting features (or even entire products), and you\nshould let your users know.\n\nHere's how Netlify closed down their asset optimization feature in 2023.\n\nSubject: Deprecation of Post-Processing Asset Optimization\n\n### Usage reports\n\nThese emails are transactional notifications by nature \u2014 hence innocent and\nnot sales-y \u2014 but you can use them strategically to remind users about your\nproduct and upsell them to higher plans.\n\nHere's an example notification from GitHub.\n\n### Account reports\n\nYou can provide additional value by analyzing user data and creating reports\nabout it. Think about this as \"quarterly business reviews on autopilot.\"\n\nIn the example below, DNSimple offers their customers a CSV report with\noptimization advice.\n\n### Cancellation emails\n\nSure, cancellation emails are not a silver bullet, but you can use them to\ncollect feedback and leave a positive aftertaste.\n\nHere's a short-n-sweet cancellation email from Encrypt.me.\n\n### Pricing update\n\nPricing update emails are loaded with potential \u2014 user emotions can sway into\ngood or bad easily. So you should be careful when writing such emails.\n\nHere's how Netlify announced their plan changes.\n\nSubject: Changes to your Netlify Plan coming in 7 days\n\n## Let's do this together\n\nSumming this up, email marketing for devtools is a green pasture. Only a\nhandful of brands are doing this at full swing.\n\nLooking for the right tool? Userlist is here to help.
