Later today, President Biden will sign a bill which,\namong other things, will put TikTok on the clock. Chinese parent ByteDance\nwill have 270 days to divest its majority stake in the company or the app will\nbe banned in the US.\n\nOf course it won't play out this way. First and foremost, there will be\nlawsuits. Second, a change of control in Washington may happen before a change\nof control of TikTok. Third, none of this may matter anyway. By passing this\nbill,^1 Congress has draped the service in a scarlet letter. And damned it to\nbe bogged down in bureaucracy for its remaining days.\n\nRegardless of the merits of this action \u2013 I happen to agree with the sale/ban,\nnot because of the fear of data or overt propaganda, but the more subtle\nsubversion where what is simply omitted from feeds sways the masses \u2013 I don't\nbelieve it will ultimately matter what happens in the end. TikTok's model is\npredicated around advertising and again, this mark and even just the\nuncertainty is going to make that a very big challenge going forward. The\naudience is massive and the demographic is key, but how is, say, McDonalds\ngoing to feel about advertising on a platform that the government has\neffectively deemed an enemy of the state?\n\nThe service is reported to already be bleeding money despite its size and\ngrowth, will ByteDance keep subsidizing it if revenue starts falling? Will\nChina push them to? Which would just bolster the case against the service?\n\nAnd while you can envision a world in which this threat of a sale/ban actually\nboosts interest and perhaps usage amongst teens \u2013 damn the man, and all that \u2013\nthat will likely prove fleeting. Things may look great before anagnorisis will\nset in. It's already hard enough for social services to stay cool beyond a\nsingle generation, it will undoubtedly be harder under threat of the service\ngoing away. Creators are the lifeblood of TikTok and just as happened with\nVine, if the service starts to wither, they'll take their talents elsewhere.^2\n\nMeanwhile the company itself will be fighting for its life in a way we haven't\nseen before. The threat of being broken up under antitrust has nothing on the\nthreat of a full ban with a time trigger. The lobbying and legal bills,\nalready insane, will go berserk. But the bigger concern will simply be the\ndistraction of it all. Product decisions will take longer. Timelines will\nslip. Executives will be absent. Employees will leave.\n\nThe best hope TikTok may have now is a strange one: that Donald Trump comes\nriding back into the White House. Interestingly enough, 270 days from today is\nJanuary 19, 2025. The next presidential inauguration is set to take place on\nJanuary 20, 2025. Surely, TikTok can argue for a one day delay while they\nawait a day one executive order. Yes, the man who originally sought to ban\nTikTok has now switched camps.^3 Can't imagine why.\n\nWe're going to hear a lot about all of this over the next six months \u2013 and\nvery likely much longer. Hopefully that includes the information Congress has\nbeen privy to leading up to the votes. But again, this feels like the end of\nTikTok regardless. Unless a white knight comes riding in quickly \u2013 and it sure\ndoesn't sound like China is going to allow that to happen \u2013 the die is cast.\nThe sale or ban may ultimately be put on ice. The chilling effect will linger.\n\n## The Inner Ring\n\nSubscribe to the new Spyglass paid tier\n\nEnter\n\n^1 Even if more \"stealthily\", by tying it into the aid packages for Ukraine,\nIsrael, and elsewhere.\n\n^2 If nothing else, it may free up time for what's next.\n\n^3 Remember when Microsoft tried to buy the service and sucked up to then\nPresident Trump in order to do so?
