This is the question that philosopher Jason Read set out to answer in\nhis new book The Double Shift: Spinoza and Marx on the Politics of Work,\npublished by Verso Books in March.\n\nRead collapses the traditional distinction between work and ideology, instead\narguing that work always plays a role in shaping our political and ethical\nviews of the world. Blending philosophy with popular culture, with references\nto Fight Club, Breaking Bad, and more, The Double Shift is an attempt to\nanswer what Baruch Spinoza saw as the ultimate question of political\nphilosophy: Why do people fight for their servitude as if it were their\nsalvation?\n\nWill Lewallen\n\nMost people will have heard of Karl Marx. Who is Spinoza, and what was the\nidea behind combining these two thinkers?\n\nJason Read\n\nBaruch Spinoza was a Dutch seventeenth-century philosopher. And really,\nSpinoza and Marx can be seen to address gaps in the other\u2019s thinking. Marx has\na much more historical sense of how economics shapes social relations, and\nwhat Spinoza can offer is a deeper sense of how imagination and emotion form\nideology.\n\nOne of the things Spinoza foregrounds is that active component, where ideology\nis not just something that people passively endure and accept but something\nthat people actively strive for. It\u2019s not just that people are still attached\nto work as its material benefits decline, but in some sense the attachment to\nwork as a measure of one\u2019s worth and standing has actually increased as the\nmaterial benefits decline. So work is seen as fueling a certain sense of\nidentity, even as it ceases to provide the basic necessities of existence. You\nsee people doubling down on work because work is the only way they can\nunderstand how to improve their existence.\n\nWill Lewallen\n\nYou define our moment as one of negative solidarity. What is this?\n\nJason Read\n\nNegative solidarity is a sense of indignation or injustice aimed not at\ncapitalism, corporations, or the conditions of work in general, but at those\nwho seem to be not working or those who work in better conditions. In the\nUnited States there is a popular bumper sticker which reads, \u201cKeep working,\nmillions on welfare depend on you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s strange because welfare since the [Bill] Clinton era has been so stripped\nback that the idea of someone being able to not work and live comfortably is\npure fiction. Yet this idea that there are people out there not working, or\nbenefiting from my work, persists. We also see this when teachers go on\nstrike. They are seen as relatively comfortable workers because they have job\nprotections and more time off, but the response is not \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have those\nthings?\u201d but just a resentment that they have these perks. This is a\nsolidarity that can only operate downwards, a race to the bottom.\n\nWill Lewallen\n\nIn the UK, this rhetoric is common during waves of industrial action,\nparticularly against workers in industries with strong levels of unionization,\nsuch as the rail sector.\n\nJason Read\n\nYeah, this situation is reinforced when only a small percentage of the\nworkforce has unions and collective bargaining; it is seen more as an elite\nthing instead of something all workers should have. The worker is no longer\nthis collective figure but has been transformed into a highly individualistic\none. One works as an individual and competes to be better, to work harder.\nWorkers have gone from a collective to individuals, and in doing so they\u2019ve\nlost their real opposition to capital.\n\nWill Lewallen\n\nYou write that this indignation comes from a feeling of powerlessness. How\ndoes this impotence lead to negative solidarity?\n\nJason Read\n\nOne of the things Spinoza stresses is that we try as much as possible to think\nabout things which increase our power. So the question is then: What do we do\nwhen we are in a situation of relative powerlessness, unable to control the\nconditions under which one works or the changing nature of work and so on? It\nseems like one answer is to make our ability to endure those conditions into a\npoint of stoic pride. \u201cLook how much I\u2019ve put up with, and doesn\u2019t this show\nhow powerful I am?\u201d In some sense, it tries to make powerlessness into a kind\nof power. The effect of this is that having to work two jobs to survive is no\nlonger seen as a problem with the economic system, but rather it shows my\nmerit.\n\nWill Lewallen\n\nThere are a lot of references to popular culture in the book. What do you\nthink can popular culture tell us about our attitudes to work?\n\nJason Read\n\nI think popular culture has to reflect our existing concerns and worries, but\nfor it to capture our imagination, it also has to warp those concerns at the\nsame time. Take the television show Breaking Bad, for example. The show begins\nwhen a high school chemistry teacher learns that he has inoperable cancer and\nbecomes incredibly worried that the cost of his health care and the loss of\nhis salary are going to leave his family destitute. So he hatches this plan to\nmanufacture and sell crystal meth.\n\nThere we see a reflection of a very real anxiety: that work doesn\u2019t provide\nfor my existence or cover health care. Yet at the same time, there is also\nthis fantasy element where he becomes really good at cooking meth; he\u2019s able\nto destroy his competition, and it\u2019s this fantasy that I can be so good at my\njob that I can take away all my fears and anxieties. Work is the source of our\nfears, but work is also the condition of overcoming our fears. Putting pop\nculture together with the theory can show the limitations of pop culture and\nalso sometimes the limitations of the theories as well.\n\nWill Lewallen\n\nThe book places a lot of emphasis on the role of the imagination. How did the\npandemic, particularly things like furlough and the pause on student debt\nrepayments, affect what people thought of as possible?\n\nJason Read\n\nWe\u2019re caught in a vicious cycle where what we imagine is in some sense\ndependent on how we live, and how we act is how act is dependent on how we\nimagine. As I said, I think pursuing individual work as a way to overcome the\nlimitations of work reveals a real constraint in the imagination. But during\nthe pandemic, the state did things that have been declared impossible by any\nneoliberal logic. It severed existence from work: for a short time, it gave\npeople cheques to live, not dependent on work.\n\nThis had a transformative effect. People are limited in what they do, and what\nthey think is possible. But sometimes all it takes is someone else doing\nsomething, and then suddenly that thing becomes possible. We\u2019ve seen this in\nthe United States in a wave of labor action in labor organizing in places like\nStarbucks and Amazon, which have an almost contagious effect.\n\nPart of the Spinozist in me says you have to recognize all the ways you are\ndetermined by material constraints and limits on the imagination before you\ncan think about all the ways in which you\u2019re free. Part of the problem with\nbeginning from an assumption of freedom is you end up saying if people put up\nwith this situation, they must like it for some reason.\n\nWill Lewallen\n\nYou write that most resistance to work is often focused on the specific\nconditions of employment rather than the general conditions of wage labor. How\ncould something like a four-day workweek help tackle these more universal\nconditions? And more broadly, what would the effect of a shorter working week\nbe on the political imaginary?\n\nJason Read\n\nThat\u2019s an important question. I think reducing work time would necessarily\nhave the positive impact of creating new ways for people to think about their\nidentities and place in the world other than through work. One of the things\nyou have to take seriously about people\u2019s investment in work, given that they\nare working so much, is that their free time is usually dedicated to what Marx\ncalls the basic \u201canimal functions\u201d of sleeping, eating, etc. You create a\nsense in which people go to work because their friends are there; everything\nthey understand about sociality comes from work. The more people work, the\nmore they will begin to identify with work.\n\nSo reducing the working week or working days would free people from this\ncycle. If people have time to do something other than buy groceries and do\ntheir laundry just to return to work the next day, they can produce another\nsense of themselves outside the confines of work. Imagination functions like a\nwedge, a small point of entry for another way of thinking; if acted upon, it\ncan then push for more. For example, the reduced workweek would give people\nmore time to engage in politics, to demand less work still. One thing that\nlimits political possibilities is work itself.\n\nAdapted from Tribune.\n\n#### Share this article\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n#### Contributors\n\nJason Read is a professor of philosophy at the University of Southern Maine\nand the author of The Production of Subjectivity: Marx and Philosophy.\n\nWill Lewallen is a freelance journalist based in London.\n\n#### Filed Under\n\n  * Ideas\n  * Work\n\n  * Karl Marx\n  * Ideology\n  * Philosophy\n  * Spinoza\n  * Four-day workweek\n\n# Sign up for our mailing list\n\nAlready on our list?
