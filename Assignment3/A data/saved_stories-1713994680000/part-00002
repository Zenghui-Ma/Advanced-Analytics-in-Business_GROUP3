(A) In a traditional biopsy, tissue\nis first excised and then undergoes multiple steps including fixation,\ndehydration, clearing, embedding, sectioning, and staining to yield 2D H&E\nsections, which can be examined under a microscope. (B) For a virtual biopsy,\nan OCT scan of tissue is acquired, and a trained neural network transforms the\n2D OCT image into a corresponding H&E-like image. Credit: Science Advances\n(2024). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi5794\n\nThe next time you have a suspicious-looking mole on your back, your\ndermatologist may be able to skip the scalpel and instead scan the spot with a\nnoninvasive \"virtual biopsy\" to determine whether it contains any cancerous\ncells. Similarly, surgeons trying to determine whether they have removed all\nof a breast tumor may eventually rely on an image captured during surgery\nrather than wait for a pathologist to process the excised tissue.\n\nStanford Medicine researchers have developed a method that uses lasers to\npenetrate tissue and create a high-resolution, three-dimensional\nreconstruction of the cells it contains. From this virtual reconstruction,\nthey can make cross-sectional images that mimic those generated by a standard\nbiopsy, in which a sample of tissue is sliced into thin layers and placed on a\nslide to be examined under a microscope.\n\nThe new method, published in Science Advances, could be used to noninvasively\nscan the skin for unhealthy cells as well as provide rapid results on biopsies\ntaken elsewhere in the body. It could also provide more information than\ncurrent diagnostic approaches.\n\n\"We've not only created something that can replace the current gold-standard\npathology slides for diagnosing many conditions, but we actually improved the\nresolution of these scans so much that we start to pick up information that\nwould be extremely hard to see otherwise,\" said Adam de la Zerda, Ph.D., an\nassociate professor of structural biology and the senior author of the article\ndescribing the method.\n\nThe method was developed by Yonatan Winetraub, Ph.D., a former graduate\nstudent in the de la Zerda lab who now leads his own research lab at Stanford\nfocusing in part on virtual biopsies.\n\n\"This has the potential to transform how we diagnose and monitor concerning\nskin lesions and diseases in the clinic,\" added co-author Kavita Sarin, MD,\nPh.D., an associate professor of dermatology.\n\n## Laser vision\n\nWhen a dermatologist or surgeon takes a biopsy from someone's body\u2014whether\nfrom the skin, liver, breast or elsewhere\u2014the tissue is usually sent to a\npathologist, who slices the biopsied tissue into thin layers. The pathologist\nthen stains each layer with chemicals called hematoxylin and eosin (H&E),\nwhich lets them more easily see the patterns, shapes and structures of cells.\n\nThese H&E slides are routinely used for diagnosing cancers and other diseases.\nBut the slides are labor-intensive and are irreversible; once a biopsy is\nsliced in one direction, for instance, it cannot be sliced another way to\nprovide a different view.\n\nFor nearly a decade, de la Zerda and his colleagues have been studying a\ndifferent way of seeing inside the body, called optical coherence tomography.\nTypically used by ophthalmologists to image the back of the eye, OCT scans\nmeasure how light waves from a laser bounce off a tissue to create a rendering\nof its insides (similar to the way ultrasound uses sound waves to visualize\norgans).\n\nAs de la Zerda and Winetraub enhanced the OCT scans so they would work in\norgans other than the eye\u2014developing both new hardware to collect data and new\nprocessing methods\u2014they needed a way to verify the accuracy of their scans, so\nthey sent the tissues they were scanning with OCT to pathologists to create\nH&E images.\n\n\"We kept improving and improving the quality of the image, letting us see\nsmaller and smaller details of a tissue,\" de la Zerda explained. \"And we\nrealized the OCT images we were creating were really getting very similar to\nthe H&Es in terms of what they could show.\"\n\n## Help from artificial intelligence\n\nThe higher resolution of the OCT images opened the door to using the method to\ndiagnose disease without producing H&Es. But de la Zerda and his colleagues\nthought clinicians would be more apt to use OCT if the images looked familiar.\n\n\"Every physician in a hospital is very much used to reading H&Es, and it was\nimportant to us that we translate OCT images into something that physicians\nwere already comfortable with, rather than an entirely new type of image,\" de\nla Zerda said.\n\nWinetraub turned to artificial intelligence to help convert OCT scans into\nflat images resembling H&E slides.\n\nFor 199 skin biopsies collected at Stanford Hospital, Winetraub carried out an\nOCT scan before pathologists created H&E slices. He and his colleagues\ndeveloped a way of putting molecular tags on the surface of the biopsies so\nthey could be sure exactly where in the OCT scan each H&E slice came from.\nThen, Winetraub paired up 1,005 of these H&E images with the corresponding OCT\nimages and entered them into an artificial intelligence algorithm which could\nlearn how to create accurate H&Es from the raw OCT data.\n\n\"The uniqueness of this work lies in the method we developed to align OCT and\nH&E image pairs, letting machine-learning algorithms train on real tissue\nsections and providing clinicians with more accurate virtual biopsies,\"\nWinetraub said.\n\nThe researchers fine-tuned the AI program by showing it an additional 553\npairs of H&E and OCT images before testing it out on new OCT images. When\nthree Stanford dermatologists analyzed random assortments of true H&E images\nand those created from the OCT scans, they could detect cellular structures at\na similar rate. Any number of H&E images can be created from a single OCT\nimage, virtually slicing the three-dimensional reconstruction in any\ndirection.\n\n## Toward noninvasive biopsies\n\nWhen a dermatologist notices an unusual looking spot on a person's skin, they\ncurrently have two options to determine if it poses a risk: wait and see\nwhether it grows bigger, or cut it off and send it to a pathologist for\ntesting.\n\nDe la Zerda and Winetraub now see a third path\u2014scanning a potentially\ncancerous mole with OCT and analyzing the virtual H&E images.\n\n\"Imagine if we could give physicians the ability, right there in the room with\nthe patient, to take out an OCT camera and\u2014rather than slice the patient up in\ndozens of places\u2014image the cells inside each mole,\" de la Zerda said.\n\nSimilarly, surgeons removing breast tumors currently send removed tissue to\npathologists to process over several days and determine whether any cancerous\ncells were missed. Around 20% of breast cancer patients require a second\nsurgery to remove more cells. If H&E images could be produced from an OCT\ncamera in the operating room to instantaneously detect whether cancer cells\nremained, subsequent surgeries could be avoided.\n\nMore work is needed to move the approach toward these applications, but the\nresearchers are confident that their approach will give clinicians a new way\nto carry out biopsies.\n\nMore information: Yonatan Winetraub et al, Noninvasive virtual biopsy using\nmicro-registered optical coherence tomography (OCT) in human subjects, Science\nAdvances (2024).
