the foreign aid bill at the White\nHouse in Washington, DC, on April 24, 2024.\n\nJim Watson | AFP | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday signed into law measures to provide aid to\nIsrael, Ukraine and Taiwan, as well as compel Chinese TikTok parent company\nByteDance to sell the social media platform or face a national ban.\n\nBiden\u2019s official approval ends a six-month saga of tense political battles on\nCapitol Hill that led to a deadlock on the foreign aid.\n\n\u201cThe path to my desk was a difficult path. It should have been easier and it\nshould\u2019ve gotten there sooner,\u201d Biden said Wednesday after signing the bill.\n\u201cBut in the end we did what America always does, we rose to the moment.\u201d\n\nBiden had signaled his intention to sign the bill into law after the House\npassed the proposal on Saturday. The Senate gave its own greenlight late\nTuesday night in an overwhelmingly bipartisan 79-18 vote, sending it to\nBiden\u2019s desk for his signature.\n\nThe law earmarks roughly $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, $26 billion for\nIsrael and $8 billion for security in Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific. It also\nrequires ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months \u2014 or a year, if Biden\ninvokes a 90-day extension \u2014 or else face a nationwide ban in the U.S.\n\nTikTok has already vowed to fight the measure.\n\n\u201cThis unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in\ncourt,\u201d the company wrote in a Wednesday statement on X following Biden\u2019s\nsigning. \u201cThis ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170\nmillion Americans.\u201d\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew posted a video response to the enactment of the TikTok\nbill, calling it a \u201cdisappointing moment\u201d and reiterating the company\u2019s\ncommitment to legally challenge the law.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s official support of the TikTok bill, his 2024 reelection\ncampaign told NBC News Wednesday that it would continue using the social media\nplatform to reach voters for at least the next year. Notably, the nine-month\nto one-year deadline for ByteDance allows it to maintain ownership of TikTok\nthrough the November election.\n\nAlong with TikTok\u2019s pushback, the bill had been the subject of heated\npolitical attacks, including threats to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson,\nR-La., from hardline Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\nThose threats were part of the reason that Johnson stalled the foreign aid\neven after the Senate, in February, passed a similar $95 billion version of\nthe bill to fund Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, though that bill did not include\nthe TikTok provisions.\n\nBut last week, with that pink slip still looming, Johnson decided to end the\nHouse\u2019s foreign aid stalemate following Iran\u2019s attempted strike on Israel on\nApril 13, which triggered fresh bipartisan pressure for the U.S. to help its\nallies.\n\nIn the following days, Johnson put four separate bills to a House vote, three\nof which would provide foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and a fourth,\nwhich would include other foreign policy proposals including the TikTok bill.\n\nThough Johnson\u2019s move came with professional risks, the speaker has so far\nstood by it, boosted by public support from former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI know that history is going to judge this well,\u201d Johnson said Wednesday\nmorning in a radio interview on the \u201cHugh Hewitt Show.\u201d \u201cIt was the right\nthing to do.\u201d\n\nTV\n\nFast Money Halftime ReportWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | The Exchange 01:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
