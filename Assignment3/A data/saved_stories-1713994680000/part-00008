It\u2019s a Game Boy Pocket motherboard that I cut in half and then\nput into a custom-designed shell with a hinge, a la the Game Boy Advance SP.\nThe build has a pair of custom-designed flex PCBs to make routing signals\nbetween the two halves of the board easier. Along the way I taught myself CAD\n(with FreeCAD), PCB design (with KiCad) and 3D printing. The 3D models and PCB\nlayouts for the Pocket SP are available on GitHub.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to talk about why and how I made the Pocket SP, and\nhow you can make your own.\n\nPocket SP in profile\n\nBut first, some acknowledgements: Thank you to the ITP/IMA shop and the NYU\nMakerspace for providing 3D printing facilities, materials and fabrication\nadvice, and to the ITP/IMA Documentation Lab for the amazing well-lit glamour\nshots of the Pocket SP that you see throughout this post. I used a screen,\nlens and buttons from Retro Game Repair Shop, a USB-C battery board from Gil\nTesa, and Helder\u2019s Pocket Power Regulator. I got the rad Link\u2019s Awakening\nlabel that you see in many of the photos, and the clear Game Boy Pocket label\nthat you\u2019ll see on the bottom of the unit, from Next Stop Please. Also thank\nyou to the Modded Gameboy Gameboy Club Discord server, whose regulars gave me\na lot of early advice and encouragement on this build.\n\nThis build won the \u201cTechnical\u201d category of the r/Gameboy Summer Modding\ncontest. In fact, that contest was what spurred me to work so hard on the\nbuild in the first place. Thanks to the contest admins for running such a cool\ncontest and providing such a useful deadline! My original photographs of this\nbuild are available on my Instagram account.\n\nPocket SP from above\n\nLike this mod? Consider contributing to my Ko-Fi.\n\n# Why I did it\n\nIt started out as sort of a joke.\n\nThe first thing you should know, if you\u2019re not already aware, is that some\npeople modify\u2014or \u201cmod\u201d\u2014their Game Boys. Some mods address shortcomings in the\nreliability or function of the device, like FroggoCustom\u2019s Game Boy Color\nbattery indicator board; others are more purely aesthetic, like Lab Fifteen\u2019s\nresin cast buttons. A small industry has arisen to serve the needs of modders,\nincluding overseas manufacturers that produce aftermarket backlit screens and\ninjection-molded aftermarket shells for every Game Boy model.\n\n## No hinge\n\nThere is a particular trend in Game Boy modding right now, which I will call\nthe \u201cno-hinge SP\u201d mod, which involves taking the motherboard of a Game Boy\nAdvance SP and putting it in a custom shell without a hinge. Some examples\ninclude Boxy Pixel\u2019s Game Boy Advance Unhinged, Makho\u2019s Slate, Xipher\u2019s SP\nSlab, and the OpenSP.\n\nAn example of a no-hinge SP: Boxy Pixel\u2019s Game Boy Advance Unhinged (image\nfrom boxypixel.com)\n\nThe Game Boy Advance SP (released in 2003) was unique among its fellows in the\nGame Boy line by virtue of this hinge, and indeed the hinge went on to be a\ndefining feature of Nintendo\u2019s hand held game consoles for the next decade and\na half. But these no-hinge mods have a certain appeal. They look cool, first\nof all, and they take advantage of the SP\u2019s comparatively compact PCB layout\nto make a Game Boy that is both small and powerful. Besides, the hinge\nassembly itself is kind of a hassle: anyone who has fixed or modded an SP is\nfamiliar with the tricky tasks of poking the axle hinges out at awkward angles\nand threading the long, fragile ribbon cable that connects the screen to the\nPCB through the narrow hollow of the hinge. So taking out the hinge makes\nsense.\n\n## Nostalgia\n\nHowever. I love the SP\u2019s hinge. I like how compact the system is when it\u2019s\nfolded up, and how minimalist it looks. Purely in terms of industrial design,\nI don\u2019t think a Nintendo handheld has matched the elegance of the SP.\n\nThe original Game Boy Advance SP. Image credit: Evan-Amos on Wikimedia\nCommons. CC-BYSA\n\nThe SP was, in fact, the first Game Boy I ever owned. I never owned or wanted\na Game Boy or Game Boy Color has a kid. By the time they hit the scene in\nstride in the mid-90s, I was already well into my teens\u2014I have a distinct\nmemory of dismissing the whole Pok\u00e9mon craze as gauche, childlike, beneath my\nrefined nearly-adult maturity. I bought my SP when I moved to New York after\ncollege, and I have very fond memories of occupying myself on long lonely\ncommutes from Westchester to Silicon Alley immersed in Ivalice and Zebes.\n\nSo something about the no-hinge mods struck me as a slight: a declaration on\nthe part of these modders that the SP was somehow imperfect. Insufficient. And\nI bristled a little bit at that. So I decided: if y\u2019all can take the hinge out\nof an SP, why can\u2019t I add a hinge to a Game Boy that never had one?\n\n## The Pocket\n\nI did my first Game Boy mod earlier in 2022. I dusted off my old soldering\niron that I bought for grad school fifteen years ago, bought a triwing\nscrewdriver, and installed an aftermarket IPS screen in my trusty old SP. I\ndid not expect to get hooked on modding, but I did. There\u2019s something\nimmensely satisfying about tinkering something to life, and that satisfaction\nthat only made more sublime when you\u2019re working with on handheld video game\nconsoles, which have always been (for me at least) cherished and intimate\nobjects. So I started reading up on modding and watching all the videos I\ncould find. (The Solderking\u2019s video showing how he fixed a Pocket that had\nbeen broken in half was particularly inspirational.) I decided to buy some old\nbroken Game Boys and try to fix them up, including kinds of Game Boys that I\u2019d\nnever owned before. I fixed up and modded Game Boy Colors, DMGs (the original\nGame Boy), and Game Boy Pockets.\n\nA green Game Boy pocket with an aftermarket LCD. My first Pocket mod.\n\nAbove is a photo of my first modded Game Boy Pocket. I\u2019d actually never held a\nPocket before working on this mod, or even seen one in-person, but after\nworking with one I immediately understood why the machine is held in such\nesteem by Game Boy modders: it\u2019s adorable. While the Pocket does have some\nwell-documented power issues, I\u2019ve found it to be a wonderful machine to work\nwith from a technical standpoint. The PCB layout and schematic of the board\nare easy to understand, and the board itself is robust and easy to repair. I\nkind of fell in love with the Pocket, and I wanted to learn more about it.\n\nSo I made up my mind: I\u2019d take a Game Boy Pocket, and put a hinge in it. Lol?\n\n# How I did it\n\nThe first thing I did was cut a Pocket motherboard in half. Just to commit\nmyself to the idea.\n\nA Pocket motherboard that I have cut in half\n\nI did this by scoring the board with a craft knife and then splitting it in\nhalf. Surprisingly easy!\n\nAfter this, I had two tasks ahead of me: one was to make a custom shell that\nwould fit the two halves of the newly split board. The other was to devise\nsome way to connect the two halves together.\n\n## Initial design concepts\n\nI did some basic measurements and made some sketches. The Pocket SP would need\nto be at least three inches wide, three inches and a bit more long, and...\npretty thick. Much thicker than the SP. (The thickness results from the fact\nthat I needed room for both the battery and the full-height cartridge slot of\nthe Pocket. The SP can be as thin as it is because the battery and half-size\ncartridge slot can sit side-by-side.) Here\u2019s my initial sketch:\n\nQuick sketch. Version 1: \u2018The Tank\u2019\n\nUnlike the stock Pocket shell, which has just three parts (the top, the\nbottom, and the battery cover), my Pocket SP shell would need five parts: the\ntwo halves of the top, the two halves of the bottom, and a \u201ccover\u201d for the\nhinge. Here\u2019s my initial sketch for those parts (except the hinge cover):\n\nSketch of various parts of the Pocket SP shell\n\nPretty much everything in this original sketch made it into the final design.\nThe only exception is the battery holder, which was rendered unnecessary when\nI decided that the Pocket SP should have an internal rechargeable battery. (I\nmade that decision partially because the battery holder looked like it would\nbe a hassle to model and fabricate.)\n\nI am not an industrial designer, so I was just kinda flying by the seat of my\npants with this design task. The main constraint I had was that I wanted the\nshell to fit a stock Pocket board (well, stock except for having been cut in\nhalf), and fit stock Pocket buttons and a Pocket screen and lens. My main\ndesign inspiration was the GBA SP itself. I stuck to the basic shapes and\ncurves of the SP as much as I could.\n\n## The hinge\n\nThe most difficult part of the shell design by far was the hinge. The original\nSP has a custom-built hinge mechanism: it\u2019s a friction hinge (i.e., a hinge\nthat holds its position) that also serves as the axle of the hinge support.\nThe hinge mechanism also \u201csnaps\u201d to two positions (fully closed and around 120\ndegrees open). The hinge mechanism is very small\u2014just a few millimeters in\ndiameter.\n\nGBA SP hinge mechanism\n\nThe hinge mechanism fits into a hinge support on the body of the SP itself,\nwhich is designed with small internal bumps that engage the shape of the hinge\nto keep the hinge in place and keep the two halves of the shell together.\n\nI spent some time investigating alternative ways of making a hinge that fits\nall of these criteria, but in the end I decided to simply replicate the hinge\nsupport of the SP, and then use aftermarket hinge mechanisms designed for the\nSP in the hinge of the Pocket SP. The benefit of this was that I was able to\nuse an off-the-shelf hinge part. The drawback: I had to make very precise\nmeasurements of the inside of the SP\u2019s hinge support structures.\n\nAnother drawback of this approach is that 3D printers\u2014especially the FDM\nprinters I was using for prototyping\u2014are not very good at reproducing small\ndetailed parts like this. More on that in a bit.\n\n## Of calipers and FreeCAD\n\nIn fact, I spent a lot of time measuring things. I used some cheap digital\ncalipers that I bought off Amazon for this task. For a few weeks in the\nsummer, my life looked like this:\n\nDigital calipers measuring distance between components on the upper inside of\na Game Boy Pocket shell\n\nI needed to make an exact copy of both the inside and outside of the pocket\nshell, so that Pocket parts would fit inside. This involved measuring the\nexact locations of every plastic jut and wall and opening and screwpost, and\nthen copying them into technical drawings in FreeCAD.\n\nFreeCAD drawing of the internal structure of the Pocket\u2019s screen support\n\nThis sounds like tedious work, but... I actually enjoyed it a lot, and often\nhad to force myself to take breaks because I was having so much fun. FreeCAD\nenforces a \u201czero degrees of freedom\u201d drawing style, in which each line and\ncurve in the drawing needs to be specified unambiguously in terms of its\nrelations to other lines and curves (distances, angles, intersections,\ntangents). It was very satisfying to go from a set of measurements to a fully\nspecified illustration and honestly I think I might have missed my life\u2019s\ncalling as a technical illustrator.\n\nI decided to use FreeCAD, by the way, because I like using free and open\nsource software as much as possible. (I don\u2019t like renting my tools, or\ninvesting time in learning a tool that might be sold or \u201csunsetted\u201d or\nreplaced or monetized in an obscene way at any moment.) This was my first time\nusing CAD software of any kind, so I don\u2019t have much to compare it to, but I\nthink FreeCAD is pretty great. This PartDesign Workbench tutorial teaches you\nabout 95% of what you need to know in order to design something of the Pocket\nSP\u2019s complexity. As of this writing, I do recommend using realthunder\u2019s\nFreeCAD branch, which has some helpful features that haven\u2019t made it into the\nmain branch yet.\n\nAfter a lot of obsessive work, and a lot of prototypes (see below), I had a\nfinished version of the complete shell design:\n\nHidden line drawing of the Pocket SP shell components\n\n## The top outside\n\nAside from the hinges, the trickiest part of the build was what I dubbed the\n\u201ctop outside,\u201d i.e., the part where the cartridge goes in. On the original SP,\nthe cartridge plugs into the bottom half of the unit, not the top. As a\nconsequence, there is no part on the SP that is analogous to the \u201ctop outside\u201d\nof the Pocket SP, and I couldn\u2019t just steal design cues from the SP like I did\nelsewhere with the design. Because of the cartridge slot on the Pocket\nmotherboard, the top outside also ended up being the thickest part of the\ndesign. Another complicating factor is that the link port is on the upper half\nof the board, which has a cumbersome shape.\n\nI wanted to mitigate the thickness of the top outside part to whatever extent\npossible in my design. My solution was to enclose as small a volume as\npossible for the cartridge port, and provide a standalone \u201chouse\u201d for the link\nport that juts above the rest of the surface. There are also two small \u201crails\u201d\nthat serve both to ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally insert an incompatible\ncartridge (like a GBA cartridge) and that there\u2019s enough material to screw in\nthe metal shielding. The end result is a little awkward, but I think it works.\n\n3D render of the \u201ctop outside\u201d\n\nI also designed a little logo for the project and added it as an embossed\nfeature. The logo is vaguely based on the logo on the lens of the original\nPocket (italic lowercase text shown as negative space on a rectangle):\n\nClose up of Game Boy Pocket logo on grey lens\n\n## Making the connection\n\nI knew that one half of the board would be in the top half of the shell, and\nthe other half would be in the bottom of the shell, and the two halves would\nneed to be connected somehow. Specifically, I needed to connect the traces on\nthe board that had been cut when the board was snapped in half. In all, there\nare fifteen different traces that go between the bottom and top half of the\nboard, namely:\n\n  * Ground\n  * VDD (5v from the voltage regulator)\n  * VEE (-19v from the voltage regulator)\n  * VCC (~3.3v) from the battery to the power switch\n  * VCC from the power switch to the voltage regulator (I forgot to add this the first time and bought connectors with the wrong number of conductors, whoops)\n  * Headphones left\n  * Headphones right\n  * Speaker\n  * Headphone switch (engaged when headphones are unplugged, activates the speaker)\n  * Up button/select button\n  * B button/left button\n  * A button/right button\n  * Down button/start button\n  * \u201cP14\u201d (when activated, reads signals from one set of buttons)\n  * \u201cP15\u201d (when activated, reads signals from the other set of buttons)\n\n(Yes, for some reason the CPUs of the Pocket and the original DMG technically\nonly have four button input pins, and then a pair of diode arrays that the CPU\npulls high or low to read from one or the other set of buttons. It\u2019s very\nweird, and I don\u2019t know why they did this. Later Game Boys have one pin per\nbutton, which seems like a better idea all around.)\n\n### Prototyping with wires\n\nI had two basic strategies in mind for how to get these fifteen signals from\none half of the board to the other.\n\nSketch of strategies for connecting the two halves\n\nThe \u201cbasic\u201d strategy I devised was to solder individual wires between the\nrelevant contact points (usually vias or solder points of through-hole parts),\nand indeed this is the strategy that I used for my initial prototypes. It\nlooks like a mess, but it worked, and showed the basic soundness of the\nconcept:\n\nTwo halves of the Pocket board with a bunch of wires connecting them. It\u2019s\nkind of gruesome, but the Game Boy boots.\n\nI quickly decided that this method would be more hassle than it was worth for\nthe final build, for a few reasons. First, it\u2019s just kind of messy and fickle.\nAlso, getting fifteen wires through the hinge assembly would be very tricky,\neven very thin-gauge wires. But most importantly, soldering the wires directly\nwould make assembling the unit difficult: you\u2019d have to solder one half,\nassemble that half entirely, and then solder the other half. To take the unit\napart, you\u2019d have to desolder all of the wires from one half first. And that\nwould be inconvenient!\n\n### Designing the flex PCB\n\nSo instead, I designed a pair of flex PCBs that could be soldered directly to\nthe board. One of the flex PCBs would end in a thin ribbon, which would go\nthrough the hinge assembly, and then connect to the other PCB with an FPC\nconnector. This would make it easy to assemble and disassemble the unit, and\nwould also make soldering pretty easy.\n\nI think the closest I\u2019d ever come to designing my own PCB was in grad school,\nwhen I downloaded EAGLE and never opened it and then deleted it at the end of\nthe semester. But I\u2019ve always wanted to design and fabricate my own PCB! I\ndecided to use KiCad, because it\u2019s free and open source and also the tool of\nchoice for many modders in the community that I respect.\n\nAs with FreeCAD, the tutorial material for KiCad is pretty great. I spent an\nafternoon following along with the Getting Started guide and felt confident\nenough afterwards to actually start making my board. My schematic is pretty\nsimple, since all I\u2019m doing is connecting pads to headers and connectors:\n\nKiCad schematic. Fifteen pads going into a connector on top, mirrored by\nfifteen pads going to a different connector below.\n\nThe PCB design was a bit more complicated. I wanted the solder pads on the PCB\nto line up exactly with the relevant vias on the Pocket motherboard, so that\ninstalling the PCB would be as simple as lining it up and \u201ctacking\u201d it to the\nboard by soldering through the pads. (Vias are points on a PCB where a trace\nmoves between layers, usually exposing enough copper to make soldering\npossible. Modders often use vias as solder points to connect together damaged\ntraces or as a means of tapping into on-board components with additional\nmods.)\n\nSo I got out the calipers again and measured exactly where the relevant vias\nare on the Pocket PCB, and lined those up with the positions of the solder\npoints on my PCB. Here\u2019s how they look:\n\nKiCad PCB layout\n\nThe taller part (looks like a vertically mirrored L) is the PCB for the upper\nhalf of the board, and the smaller part (looks like West Virginia) is the PCB\nfor the lower half of the board.\n\nTo keep costs down, I designed these as single-layer PCBs, which accounts for\nthe tricky routing on the smaller part. I also ended up with several solder\npoints that are not meant to be soldered to vias, but instead require you to\nsolder a wire from that point to the relevant part of the Pocket PCB. The\nreasons for this are twofold: first, extending the flex PCB to cover the\nrelevant vias (especially the vias for the power switch) increases the cost of\nthe board significantly. Second, I wanted to make it easy to use the flex PCBs\nwith various other mods, which might cover some of the same footprint.\n\n## Prototypes and fabrication\n\nThe description above makes it seem as though I 360 no-scoped the design\nprocess, but of course I was making many physical prototypes along the way to\nverify the design. I have a gallon-sized ziploc bag full of 3D printed\nprototypes of the shell:\n\nAlong with detailed notes and to-do lists that resulted from each prototype:\n\nPhoto of my to-do list for shell prototype v0.5, the frustrating one\n\nAnd of course I made many mistakes along the way.\n\n### Flubbing the shell\n\nMost of my prototypes were printed on the Ultimakers in the shop at my\ndepartment at NYU. Having access to this resource made the process of\ndesigning and fabricating much easier\u2014I could test and iterate on design ideas\nin a matter of hours. The only problem with the Ultimakers is that (as FDM\nprinters) they\u2019re not super great with finely detailed overhanging\nfeatures\u2014like, say, the inside of my hinge supports. It wasn\u2019t until I got SLA\nresin prints (from JLCPCB) that I actually had any good evidence that my hinge\nsupports were designed correctly. These SLA resin prints are what I used to\nbuild the Pocket SP that I submitted to the Reddit contest.\n\nFortunately, the design itself turned out to be fine (I felt such a huge\nrelief when the hinge mechanisms clicked into the support). But! I\naccidentally had the inner half of the hinge supports attached in the wrong\ndirection, which means that the Pocket SP I built from that print doesn\u2019t\nactually close all the way, and it opens a bit too far. (This problem is fixed\nin later prints!) I also sent the wrong file for one of the parts of the shell\n(the bottom outside). This is why the bottom outside is a different color from\nthe other parts in the photographs that I submitted for the Reddit modding\ncontest\u2014that part is actually from a separate FDM print!\n\nProfile of the Pocket SP, where the bottom outside is cream-colored FDM ABS,\nand the other parts are semi-translucent white resin\n\nThankfully it... sorta... looks intentional?\n\n### The stock screen\n\nMy original intention was to use an original stock Game Boy Pocket screen in\nthe Pocket SP. The connector PCBs were designed with this intention in mind:\nthere\u2019s a trace for VEE (-19v), which is only (as far as I know) used by the\nstock screen, and not by any of the aftermarket backlit LCDs currently on the\nmarket. I was so secure in the way I\u2019d designed the model that I didn\u2019t even\nbother to check to see if the stock screen would fit until I was several\nprints in. At that point, however, I discovered this:\n\nRear of a Game Boy Pocket stock screen sitting inside a messy 3D print\n\nIt might not be clear from this photo. But... the screen doesn\u2019t fit. To be\nprecise, the display portion of the screen fits fine (fits like a glove,\neven)! But the lower connector of the screen\u2014where the ribbon cable is\nsoldered to the vertical screen inputs\u2014is about 2mm too long to fit in the\nshell. Give me an f in the chat.\n\nI devised a handful of fixes to this problem that I didn\u2019t end up pursuing.\nOne fix would be to make the whole shell longer by 2mm to accommodate the\nconnector, but I don\u2019t like this idea because the shell is already on the\nverge of feeling significantly longer than it is wide. Another fix would be to\nadjust the position of the screen supports inside of this part of the shell to\nbe a bit higher, but this solution would probably necessitate removing and\nrelocating the power switch. In the end, I decided to not fix this problem and\njust declare that the Pocket SP shell only works with aftermarket screens.\n(Aftermarket LCDs are generally larger and thicker than the stock screen, but\nthey lack the bulky connector at the bottom).\n\n### Flubbing the PCBs\n\nI got the flex PCBs fabricated at OSH Park. They turned my order around really\nquick and I was excited to get the boards back. However, all was not well: I\nquickly discovered I\u2019d accidentally put the footprint for my FPC connector on\nbackwards:\n\nFlex PCB soldered to the lower half of a Pocket PCB. There\u2019s an FPC connector\non the board but it\u2019s hanging off the edge.\n\n(In case it\u2019s not obvious, I meant for the connector to be able to sit inside\nthat white rectangle but still have the connector\u2019s opening face toward the\ntop.) Thankfully I was able to improvise and solder the connector to the\ncontacts anyway, though the connector ends up a bit awkwardly placed. The\nlatest round of boards that I just got back from OSH Park has the fix. For\ncomparison, here\u2019s the fixed version:\n\nSame flex PCB, but this time it\u2019s inside the box instead of hanging off of it\n\n# Takeaways\n\nGame Boy Pocket SP in a clear shell\n\nIn the end, despite all the mistakes and hardships, I got the thing to work.\nHere\u2019s the latest iteration of the Pocket SP, in a clear resin shell (from\nPCBWay) with the updated flex PCBs. Honestly? I think it\u2019s the coolest thing\nI\u2019ve ever made.\n\nSo what did I learn while making the Pocket SP? Well, first off, I learned a\nlot of new skills, like PCB design and CAD and fabrication. These are things\nthat I\u2019ve always been interested in, and the fact that I\u2019ve developed these\nskills has opened up so many new possibilities in other areas of my arts\npractice. I also learned a lot about the design of the Pocket itself, which\nhas refined and advanced my knowledge of the history of technology in general.\n\nI learned that there really is no end to the depth of enthusiasm around these\nold Nintendo handhelds, and no end to the depth of generosity that enthusiasts\nand experts demonstrate in sharing their knowledge. I am eternally indebted,\nfor example, to Game Boy maestro Gekkio for these amazing schematics of the\nGame Boy Pocket. I pretty much slept with this PDF under my pillow for a few\nmonths this summer.\n\nUnderside of the Pocket SP\n\nI learned some things about myself, too. For example, I learned that I really\nlike making physical objects. From here on out, programming computers all the\ntime and making things that only exist on the screen just ain\u2019t gonna cut it.\nAnother thing I learned about myself: I kinda like being old. I recently\nturned 41 and sure, my back hurts all the time and I\u2019m going grey, but I have\nenough experience and domain knowledge at this point that picking up CAD and\nPCB design over the summer isn\u2019t that big a deal. It feels nice to reap the\nrewards of all of my experience.\n\nI also learned that... hinges suck. They\u2019re difficult to design and difficult\nto fabricate. You should avoid them whenever possible. Why did I even do this.\n\n# How you can do it\n\nAt this point, maybe you\u2019re a little intrigued. Maybe you want to try out the\nbuild yourself! In this section, I\u2019m going to describe how to do just that.\n\nA few things to note up top. First: consider this an \u201calpha\u201d version of the\nmod. I\u2019m reasonably sure that the build is more or less functional, safe and\ndurable, but there\u2019s also a good chance that something could go wrong or break\nhorribly\u2014build at your own risk. Second: this is a pretty advanced mod. You\nshould be handy with a soldering iron and be able to read a schematic. The mod\ninvolves a permanent and irrevocable modification to the main board (i.e.,\ncutting it in half), so don\u2019t attempt this mod if you\u2019re not okay with, you\nknow, doing that. Third: this is an expensive mod. Because you\u2019ll be ordering\nparts one-off, you won\u2019t benefit from economies of scale. The items in the\nbill of materials below will easily run you around US$250, if not more.\n\n(By the way, if anyone\u2019s interested buying a kit from me, let me know\u2014if\nthere\u2019s enough interest, I can order a bunch of shells and PCBs at a time and\nresell them at lower cost.)\n\nIf this is your first time working with a Game Boy Pocket, here are a few\nresources I suggest having on hand:\n\n  * Gekkio\u2019s Pocket schematics\n  * Modded Gameboy Gameboy Club\u2019s Pocket board scans\n  * Makho\u2019s Why The Game Boy Pocket Sucks (explains the Pocket\u2019s power issues and how to work around them)\n\n## What you need\n\nHere\u2019s the bill of materials.\n\n  * A Game Boy Pocket\n  * My custom Pocket SP shell\n  * My flex PCB boards\n  * One FH12-15S-0.5SH(55) Hirose FFC connector\n  * An aftermarket backlit LCD screen\n  * A pair of Game Boy Advance SP hinges (harvested from an original SP, or purchased new)\n  * Gil Tesa\u2019s Game Boy Pocket USB C charging kit\n  * A 102045 3.7v LiPo battery\n  * Two extra 8mm Game Boy Pocket/Game Boy Color screws (you can harvest these from another unit, or buy new ones)\n  * A 3mm diffusing light pipe\n  * Optional: Game Boy Advance SP screwhole cover rubber bumpers (you can harvest these from an SP or buy new)\n  * Optional: an aftermarket Game Boy Pocket sticker (I recommend these clear labels from Next Stop Please)\n  * Optional: an aftermarket 5V voltage regulator, such as Helder\u2019s Pocket Power Regulator\n  * Technically optional but strongly recommended: an aftermarket glass Pocket lens\n\nYou\u2019ll also need a soldering iron, some flux, a multimeter, and a good sharp\ncraft knife.\n\nFurther details on these items in the sections below.\n\n### The \u201cdonor\u201d Game Boy Pocket\n\nYou\u2019ll need to source an original Game Boy Pocket\u2014a \u201cdonor\u201d unit. The shell\ndoesn\u2019t need to be in particularly good condition, and neither does the\nscreen, since we\u2019re going to replace both. But you\u2019ll want to get a functional\nand reliable unit, so that you know that any problems you\u2019re having while\ndoing the Pocket SP build aren\u2019t caused by some underlying problem with the\nunit itself.\n\nYou can find used Game Boy Pockets on (e.g.) eBay in fairly good condition for\nless than US$50.\n\nThe Game Boy Pocket had several hardware revisions that have slightly\ndifferent motherboard layouts. To the best of my knowledge, all of them are\ncompatible with the Pocket SP build. One of the motherboard revisions is\nincompatible with Gil Tesa\u2019s USB-C mod out of the box, but Gil has posted some\ninstructions on how to work around that incompatibility.\n\n### The shell and the flex PCBs\n\nI\u2019ve uploaded the 3D model for the shell and the KiCad files for the flex PCBs\nto GitHub under a CC BY-SA-NC license.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to have the shell fabricated somewhere, in the form of a 3D print.\nThis involves downloading the STL files from the GitHub repository, and then\nuploading them to a 3D printing service, and selecting the materials and\nprinting method you\u2019d like to use. I\u2019ve had luck with both JLCPCB\u2019s SLA Ledo\n6060 Resin and PCBWay\u2019s SLA UTR-8100 Transparent Resin. I highly recommend SLA\nprinting, rather than FDM printing\u2014in my experience, an FDM printer (even a\nfancy industrial FDM printer) is not able to accurately reproduce the small\ndetails of the model, especially the inside of the hinge supports.\n\nYou can order the flex PCBs directly from OSH Park. If you order from OSH\nPark, make sure to select \u201cflex PCB\u201d\u2014the PCBs will not fit or function as\nintended if they\u2019re manufactured any other way. You can also download the\nKiCad file from the GitHub repository and export the appropriate files from\nthe KiCad PCB designer to have the PCB manufactured at your provider of\nchoice. (For US-based folks, I\u2019ve found that OSH Park offers the best trade-\noff between cost and turn-around time.)\n\n### The screen\n\nAs I mentioned above, the Pocket SP mod is not currently compatible with stock\nPocket screens. Instead, you\u2019ll need to buy an aftermarket LCD. In particular,\nthe shell as designed works out-of-the-box with this AIO-XL kit. I don\u2019t think\nit would be conceptually difficult to get the shell to work with other\naftermarket LCD screens, but you might need to either redesign the inside of\nthe shell a bit before printing, or trim the shell a bit after printing. (If\nyou decide to trim the shell, please note that SLA-printed resin is very\nbrittle and cracks easily, unlike the injection-molded ABS of the stock Pocket\nshell\u2014you\u2019ll need to be incredibly careful when trimming it. Don\u2019t ask me how\nI know this.)\n\n## Step-by-step instructions\n\nHere are some step-by-step instructions on how to perform the mod!\n\n### 1\\. Preparing the board and cutting it in half\n\nRemove the Pocket motherboard from its shell and unlatch the stock screen. The\nPocket SP custom shell is compatible with stock buttons, silicone membranes\nand switch covers, so hold onto those if you want. You\u2019ll also want to hold on\nto the EMI shielding (the metal plate that goes under the cartridge slot) and\nall of the screws.\n\nThen you\u2019ll want to desolder the battery contacts. We won\u2019t need them. Use a\nsolder sucker or solder braid to remove all of the solder from the solder\npoints on the top of the board (i.e., the side with the button contacts). Once\nthe solder is gone, you should be able to simply pull the contacts through\nfrom the other side. Move slowly and be thorough and don\u2019t force it!\n\nNow you\u2019ll need to cut the Pocket motherboard in half. (Technically you can do\nthis before you remove the battery contacts, but it\u2019s a bit easier to keep the\nboard steady while cutting it if you\u2019ve already removed the contacts.) To cut\nthe board in half, you\u2019ll want to get a straight edge and score the top of the\nboard (i.e., the side with the button contacts) lightly, along a line just\nbelow the two \u201cclips\u201d of the cartridge connector port. The red line in the\nimage below shows where you should score:\n\nNow, cut the PCB along that line. You can do this with just the craft knife:\nafter you\u2019ve scored the line, deepen the cut progressively with the knife by\nrunning the knife repeatedly in the groove. Move slowly so you don\u2019t\naccidentally go out of the groove and scratch nearby parts of the board. Once\nthe groove is deep enough, snap the board in half\u2014it should separate cleanly\nalong the groove.\n\n### 2\\. Preparing the flex PCBs\n\nYou\u2019ll want to solder the FPC connector to the corresponding footprint on the\nlower part of the flex PCB (the part that sort of looks like West Virginia).\nThis is a delicate soldering job, and it\u2019ll be easier with an SMD hot plate\nand some solder paste. But it is possible to do it by hand with a bit of flux\nand patience. What\u2019s worked for me is soldering down the mount points first\n(the large squares on either side of the footprint), taking care to keep the\npins of the connector lined up with the corresponding contacts on the board.\nThen carefully solder down each individual pin. Clear any bridges with a bit\nof solder wick when you\u2019re done. It should look like this:\n\nFPC connector soldered to the lower portion of the flex PCB\n\nThe end of the ribbon cable portion of the top half of the flex PCB (the part\nshaped like an inverted L) isn\u2019t thick enough on its own to fit snugly into\nthe FPC connector. I recommend cutting a small piece of Kapton tape to the\nshape and size of the end of the ribbon and sticking it to the side of the\nribbon with no exposed contacts, like so:\n\nKapton tape on the end of the ribbon cable\n\n### 3\\. Solder the top part of the flex PCB\n\nNow is a good time to solder the top half of the flex PCB to the front of the\ntop half of the Pocket motherboard. The flex PCB has small through holes that\nline up with relevant vias on the board. You\u2019ll want to line up the through\nholes on the flex PCB with the vias on the board, and then solder them into\nplace. (You might need to turn the top of your craft knife in the vias to\nexpose enough copper to solder to.) You\u2019ll also need to solder two bodge wires\nfrom the SW-VCC1 and VCC contacts on the flex PCB to the test point and via on\nthe Pocket board with the same names. The contact on the inner corner of the\nflex PCB should line up with the ground pin of the cartridge connector; bridge\nthese two with a big glob of solder. It should look like this when you\u2019re\ndone:\n\nTop part of the flex PCB soldered to the top front of the Pocket board\n\nNow is a great time to test everything! Connect the lower half of the flex PCB\nto the upper half by plugging the end of the ribbon section into the FPC. The\ncontacts of the ribbon should face down. Once it\u2019s plugged in, use a\nmultimeter to make sure that you\u2019re getting continuity between the through-\nholes on the lower half of the board to the corresponding through-holes on the\nupper half. (If you\u2019re not getting continuity, double check your soldering on\nboth the top half of the board and the FPC connector.)\n\n### 4\\. Power\n\nNow we\u2019ll turn our attention to the lower half of the board. Install the Gil\nTesa battery mod (and the Helder Pocket Power regulator, if you\u2019re choosing to\nuse one) as directed in the instructions for those mods. It should look\nsomething like this when you\u2019re done:\n\nLower half of Pocket board with USB-C board and Helder Pocket Power regulator\n\nThe only step you\u2019ll want to skip with the Gil Tesa mod is soldering the small\nLED board to the spot on the Pocket board where the power LED is located.\nInstead, you\u2019ll want to solder two bodge wires to the back of the small LED\nboard, one to ground on the Pocket board and the other to power. (I soldered\nmine to the VDD pin of the power regulator.) In this image, the yellow wire\ngoes to power, and black goes to ground:\n\nBack of Gil Tesa LED board\n\nHere\u2019s what the LED board looks like with everything soldered:\n\nLED board soldered with five wires to the USB-C mod board\n\nAt this point, if you plug the LiPo battery in, and plug the USB-C port to\npower, the red LED on the small LED board should light up (to show that the\nbattery is charging):\n\nEverything\u2019s plugged in!\n\n### 5\\. Solder the lower half of the flex PCB\n\nLooking good. Now, solder the lower half of the flex PCB to the lower bottom\nof the Pocket motherboard. Just as with the top half of the flex PCB, you\u2019ll\nwant to line up the through holes of the flex PCB with the relevant vias on\nthe Pocket board itself, and then tack the through holes down with solder.\nBecause of the heavy solder mask on the Pocket PCB, you\u2019ll almost certainly\nneed to prepare the vias on the Pocket motherboard by either running a\nfiberglass pencil over the vias a few times, or scraping the inside of the\nvias a bit with the tip of your craft knife. When you\u2019re done, it should look\nlike this:\n\nLower half of flex PCB soldered to lower half of Pocket motherboard\n\nAs shown in the photo, you\u2019ll need to solder four bodge wires from solder\npoints on the flex PCB to other points on the board. VCC goes to the VIN pin\nof the voltage regulator; SW-VCC2 goes to the VCC pin of the Gil Tesa board.\nSPKR2 goes to the top solder point of the speaker, and SW2 goes to pin 5 of\nthe headphone jack.\n\n### 6\\. Connecting everything and testing the screen\n\nAt this point, you should be able to plug the lower half of the board into the\nupper half of the board by re-attaching the ribbon to the FPC connector. And\nthen... turn it on! The LED should turn white and after a few seconds you\nshould hear the \u201cba-DING!\u201d noise of a healthy Game Boy Pocket. If not, double\ncheck your connections and your solder points.\n\nLower and upper flex PCBs, together at last\n\nNow is also a great time to test your screen. You\u2019ll want to install the\nscreen for testing as directed by the instructions from the screen\u2019s\nmanufacturer or retailer. The AIOXL screen that I recommended needs to have\none bodge wire soldered to the power switch, like so:\n\nBodge wire soldered between screen ribbon and power switch\n\nAt this point, you should be able to turn everything on and see output on the\nscreen:\n\nTitle screen of Link\u2019s Awakening showing on a Game Boy mess\n\n### 7\\. Assemble the top of the unit\n\nNow we can start putting the guts into the shell! The first step is to secure\nthe EMI shield to the top outside of the shell. (The \u201ctop outside\u201d is the part\nof the shell with the \u201cpocketSP\u201d logo.) Line up the EMI shield and secure it\nwith two screws in the bottom two screw holes. (Note that this is two fewer\nscrews than were used to secure the shield in the original shell.)\n\nEMI shield attached\n\nDisconnect the flex PCB ribbon from the FPC connector on the lower part of the\nflex PCB for now. (We\u2019ll re-attach it later.)\n\nNow you\u2019ll want to bend the screen\u2019s ribbon so that the screen is folded over\nthe front half of the board, and then fit the screen into the top inside part\nof the shell. (The \u201ctop inside\u201d is the part of the shell that has the opening\nfor the screen.) If you\u2019re using an AIOXL screen, the screen should just sort\nof nestle into the right spot\u2014if not, you might need to trim a bit. (Again,\nremember that resin prints are very brittle and you need to be extremely\ncareful when trimming.)\n\nThen, put the top outside of the shell onto the top inside, so that it fits on\ntop of the cartridge connector. It might take a bit of adjustment to get\neverything aligned and fitting snugly, especially the little \u201chouse\u201d for the\naccessory port. Oh and don\u2019t forget the power switch cover!\n\nWhen everything fits, it should like this:\n\nSecure the halves of the top shell with screws. (Don\u2019t overtighten!)\n\n### 8\\. Twist the ribbon cable\n\nThe ribbon cable portion of the top PCB should be emerging from the assembled\ntop half of the shell from a small opening near the hinge support. Give the\nribbon a twist, so it turns about 360 degrees inside the cylinder formed by\nthe two halves of the hinge support. Be gentle with this twist and make sure\nthat the ribbon cable is fully clear of any obstructions:\n\nRibbon going through the hinge\n\n### 9\\. The bottom half\n\nNow, secure the lower half of the Pocket motherboard into the bottom inside of\nthe shell. (The \u201cbottom inside\u201d is the part of the shell that has openings for\nthe face buttons.) Put the buttons and the silicone membranes in first, and\nthen screw the lower half of the Pocket motherboard into place. It should look\nlike this:\n\nBottom half of motherboard secured\n\n(I\u2019ve only used two screws here, but that\u2019s only because I lost the other\nscrew, whoops!)\n\nThere\u2019s a small plastic guard in the lower half of the shell that is designed\nto fit the small LED PCB included with the Gil Tesa kit. You should be able to\njam the PCB in there until it\u2019s stuck. If it doesn\u2019t stick, or if there isn\u2019t\nenough room, you might need to either trim or use a bit of glue. There is also\na small hole on the top of the lower inside which should be just big enough\nfor the 3mm light pipe\u2014trim the light pipe for length and put it into that\nopening. (Again, depending on your print, this opening might be too tight or\ntoo loose\u2014trim or glue as needed.)\n\n### 10\\. The ribbon and the hinge\n\nNow, thread the end of the flex PCB ribbon through the small rectangular\nopening on the lower inside of the shell, keeping the twisted portion of the\nribbon inside the cylinder of the hinge support:\n\nRibbon going through the hinge and into the lower half of the hsell\n\nMake sure that the hinge supports of the top half of the shell and the bottom\nhalf of the shell are lined up, and then insert the hinges. Look inside the\nhinge supports\u2014there are small \u201ctabs\u201d on either side that need to be perfectly\naligned for you to be able to insert the hinges. They should align when the\nshell is all the way \u201cclosed\u201d or open to about 120 degrees. The hinges\nthemselves have an \u201copen\u201d position and a \u201cclosed\u201d position and will only fit\ninto the shell when their position matches up with the position of the hinge\nsupports. When everything looks right, insert the hinges firmly until they\n\u201cclick\u201d\u2014the tabs at the end of the hinge should emerge from the inside of the\nhinge support. It\u2019ll look like this:\n\nHinge, properly inserted\n\nIf you encounter significant resistance when inserting the hinge, you either\ndon\u2019t have the hinge supports lined up, or there\u2019s some cruft inside of the\nhinge supports that is blocking the hinge from being fully inserted. (This is\nespecially likely to happen with FDM prints.)\n\nOnce the ribbon is threaded and the hinges are installed, you can reattach the\nribbon cable to the FPC connector. There should be a little bit of slack, but\nnot much.\n\nRibbon cable reattached\n\nAt this point, you\u2019ll also want to secure the small hinge guard. This is the\nsmall piece that looks like a half-pipe. Align the hinge guard along the\ncorresponding groove on the top of the bottom inside part of the shell so that\nthe screw hole aligns with the small screw opening. Use one of the unused\nscrews from the EMI shield to secure the hinge guard in place.\n\n### 11\\. Battery and assembling the lower half\n\nThe LiPo battery is intended to nestle inside the two plastic guards you\u2019ll\nfind on the top surface of the bottom inside of the board. Depending on the\nexact dimensions of your battery, you might want to add a little bit of\npadding to the bottom outside of the board so that the battery doesn\u2019t rattle\naround. I used some rectangular foam strips from Adafruit.\n\nSome padding attached to the bottom outside\n\nAt this point, you should be able to secure the bottom outside of the shell\nwith screws. There are four screw holes. (This is why you need two extra\nscrews\u2014the original Pocket only had six screws, but the Pocket SP has\neight\u2014four on top, four on bottom.) Again, don\u2019t overtighten!\n\nBottom outside, secured\n\n### 12\\. Finishing touches\n\nYou\u2019re done! The only steps left are to affix the lens of your choice, stick\nthe SP screwhole bumpers in the upper corners of the top inside shell, and to\nput a Game Boy Pocket sticker on the bottom. Enjoy!\n\nCompleted build\n\n# Concluding remarks\n\nPocket SP, closed\n\nThat\u2019s it! If you have any questions or want to get in touch, please send me\nan e-mail.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading about this project, or even if you just learned\nsomething new from this write-up, consider contributing to my Ko-Fi. I had so\nmuch fun developing this project, but the research and development process was\nalso very expensive: in addition to the costs of materials and manufacturing,\nthere\u2019s also the cost of my own labor. As an artist, I get funding for my\nprojects primarily from grants issued by arts organizations and commissions\nfrom businesses and corporations\u2014neither of which are, in my estimation,\nlikely to support work on Game Boy mods. A few bucks in the Ko-Fi goes a long\nway to making it easier to devote time to unexpected and interesting stuff\nlike this mod.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
