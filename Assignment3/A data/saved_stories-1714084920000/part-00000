This new pricing is designed to give our Linkerd adopters a\nclear way and transparent picture of the cost of BEL, to be fair and\ncommensurate with Linkerd's value, and to avoid penalizing specific\narchitectural decisions and technical decisions that are independent of how\nLinkerd is used.\n\nPublic pricing like this is a first for a service mesh\u2014yet another first in a\nlong line of firsts for Linkerd\u2014but we believe it is necessary to fulfill our\ncommitment to transparency to the community. This pricing is the result of\nmany weeks of collaborative work with Linkerd adopters and Buoyant customers\naround the globe, and we're very excited to finally roll it out live.\n\nYou can see this new pricing on our Plans and Pricing page.\n\n## A new model for stable releases; a new new model for pricing\n\nEarlier this year, we announced that as of Linkerd 2.15, Buoyant would only be\ncreating new stable release artifacts for BEL and would no longer ship open\nsource stable release artifacts. This move was necessary to secure the long-\nterm future of Linkerd\u2014a project we created almost a decade ago, and believe\ncan survive for another century\u2014by ensuring that the tens of thousands of\ncompanies that are building successful businesses on top of Linkerd today have\na clear way to fund the continued growth and improvement of the project.\n\nOf course, while this was a change in release artifact process, it was not a\nchange in the open source nature of Linkerd. Linkerd remains a fully open\nsource, graduated CNCF project, and Buoyant continues to maintain and advance\nLinkerd just as it always has, including by delivering open source edge\nrelease artifacts with the latest features, bugfixes, and security patches.\nOur commitment to a truly open source project has never wavered.\n\nMonths in, this change has already had a profoundly positive impact. It has\nallowed us to significantly increase the pace of development in Linkerd, to\nroll out a new and incredibly powerful build and test pipeline, and ship\nfeatures such as high-availability zonal load balancing in BEL. The Linkerd\ncommunity has been incredibly supportive throughout this, and we are\nprofoundly grateful to those who have been so willing to work with us to\nrefine this approach.\n\nOne piece of consistent feedback from our original announcement was that the\ncluster-based pricing we announced for BEL didn't work for many Linkerd\nadopters. While it was simple and understandable, it failed to scale\ngracefully for Linkerd adopters whose deployments included large numbers of\nsmall clusters. We knew this was something we had to fix as rapidly as\npossible.\n\nFor the past 6 weeks, we've been working with our Linkerd adopter community to\nfix this and to provide pricing that is public, realistic, and reflective of\nLinkerd's value. We soft-launched this pricing several weeks ago and today,\nwe're happy to formally announce it.\n\n## Introducing Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd Pricing\n\nFirst, BEL is always free to use for companies with fewer than 50 employees.\nBuoyant is a product of startup ecosystem innovation ourselves, and we know\njust how stressful and complex this stage of a company can be. We want to\nencourage this innovation and avoid introducing any friction.\n\nFor organizations with 50 or more employees, BEL is available under three\nplans: standard, premium, and enterprise.\n\nStandard. This plan is for companies for whom Linkerd provides baseline\ncritical features such as mutual TLS, observability, and reliability, but who\nare otherwise not making use of Linkerd's advanced features. It includes\nlifecycle automation and all of Linkerd's great reliability and observability\nfeatures. The monthly Standard Plan cost for BEL is USD 300 for the first 100\nmeshed pods and USD 50 for each additional block of 100 meshed pods.\n\nPremium. This plan is for companies who are using advanced Linkerd features\nsuch as secure, transparent multi-cluster communication, VM support, and zero-\ntrust authorization policies. The monthly Premium Plan cost for BEL is USD 500\nfor the first 100 meshed pods and USD 75 for each additional block of 100\nmeshed pods.\n\nEnterprise. This plan is designed for companies that truly want to partner\nwith Buoyant and make full use of our hands-on expertise of almost a decade of\ndeploying and operating service meshes in production\u2014more than any other\ncompany in the world. This plan is very flexible and tailored to your needs,\nso this plan is always a discussion.\n\nYou can see a summary and the full feature matrix on our Plans and Pricing\npage.\n\nOrganizations who are eligible for these plans can sign up today and get\nstarted\u2014billing only starts on May 21st. But you should talk to us if:\n\n  * You have a very large number of meshed pods (more than 2,500);\n  * Your organization has already fixed its budget for the year and it does not reset for a long time; or\n  * You are a non-profit or otherwise have unique needs.\n\nWe're happy to work with you, and I promise we'll be flexible and\naccommodating. BEL is the future of Linkerd and we want everyone onboard with\nthat.\n\n## So what's next?\n\nThe shift to BEL stable releases has already been a profoundly positive change\nfor team Linkerd and has unlocked our ability to invest in the project. Over\nthe past few weeks, we've rolled out compatibility testing for all BEL\nreleases against specific Kubernetes versions, distributions, and\narchitectures. We've shipped Linkerd 2.15.2, which adds our High Availability\nZonal Load Balancer to the proxy, a new load balancer that cuts expensive\ncross-zone traffic yet preserves availability in situations where Topology-\nAware Routing falls apart. And over the next few weeks we'll be announcing\neven more major updates to Linkerd, including support for IPv6 and improved\nmesh expansion ergonomics.\n\nNone of this would be possible without the support and encouragement of our\nLinkerd community. We're profoundly grateful to everyone who has given us\nfeedback and helped us refine this model. And, most of all, we're grateful to\nour customers who have taken this critical step with us in Linkerd's evolution\nto a project that will truly stand the test of time. After all, Linkerd has\nbeen with us for almost a decade already\u2014we believe it can live for another\ncentury.\n\nAnyone can download BEL and get started today. Give it a spin and let us know\nwhat you think! As always, we're listening.\n\n##### Further reading\n\n##### Further reading\n\n##### Further reading\n\n##### Further reading\n\n##### Further reading\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE SERVICE MESH NEWSLETTER\n\nNo junk.
