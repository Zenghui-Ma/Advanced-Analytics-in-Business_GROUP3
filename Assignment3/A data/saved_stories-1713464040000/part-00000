One day, you\u2019re bursting with energy and\nenthusiasm, tackling your projects with a sense of flow. The next, you find\nyourself stuck in a rut, struggling to muster the drive to get anything done.\nIt\u2019s a frustrating cycle that can leave you feeling helpless and unproductive.\n\nThis is especially true for long-term projects that involve some of the\nslower, longer-term kind of grind, such as writing content and building\ncommunities. You know you care, but you\u2019re bound to have days where it\u2019s just\nhard to get to work.\n\nBut what if you could break free from this cycle and take control of your\nmotivation? Self-motivation isn\u2019t some mysterious force that you\u2019re born with\nor without. It\u2019s a skill that can be learned and developed. By understanding\nthe science behind it, you can master the tools you need to stay motivated and\nmake progress on the projects that matter to you.\n\n## The Science of Motivation\n\nResearch suggests that motivation finds its roots in the dopamine pathways in\nour brain. When we anticipate that something will feel good, dopamine starts\nkicking in. And this is very relevant to self-motivation, as imagining the\nreward we\u2019d get by acting gives us a little boost in dopamine, just as if we\nactually acted already.\n\nAccording to psychologists, there are two main types of motivation:\n\nExtrinsic motivation. The most common sources of extrinsic motivation are\nexternal rewards, such as earning money, winning a prize, or getting good\ngrades. Extrinsic motivation can also be negative, for example being scared of\ngetting fired or of having a fight with your partner. While extrinsic\nmotivation works great in the short term, it will only last as long as you\nconsider the external rewards to be satisfying. Not interested in money\nanymore? There goes your motivation.\n\nIntrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation has been defined as the desire to\nseek out new things and new challenges, to test and analyze your abilities,\nand to complete tasks you find rewarding in and of themselves. It was first\ndiscovered in animals engaging in playful and curiosity-driven behaviors, even\nwithout a given reward. With intrinsic motivation, the reason why you act is\ninternal.\n\nHow do you build more intrinsic motivation into your life? Researchers have\nidentified several ingredients you need three key ingredients to build\nintrinsic motivation.\n\nThe first is self-efficacy, trusting that you have the choice and the freedom\nto act however you want to. Of course, you need to be aware of your current\nmotivational state, but researchers discovered that equally important is how\nconfident you feel in your ability to change it.\n\nThe second one is curiosity. Neuroimaging studies suggest that intrinsic\nmotivation and curiosity share the same dopaminergic systems. It\u2019s much easier\nto feel motivated when you find a question interesting or when you notice an\ninformation gap you want to fill.\n\nInterestingly, neuroimaging studies have revealed that self-efficacy and\ncuriosity are not only important ingredients for self-motivation but are also\ninterconnected in the brain. A study found that the strength of activation of\nthe \u201ccuriosity brain network\u201d mediates the relationship between self-efficacy\nand curiosity.\n\nIn other words, your confidence in your ability to change your motivational\nstate plays a significant role in shaping your curiosity. This link between\nself-efficacy and curiosity in the brain shows the importance of cultivating\nboth factors when you want to motivate yourself.\n\nLastly, you need a feeling of increased competence\u2014believing that the task\nwill teach you something new and make you more knowledgeable and more\nefficient. This sense of growth and mastery keeps you motivated to continue\npursuing the task even in the face of setbacks.\n\nSelf-efficacy, curiosity, and competence: these are the three ingredients you\nneed to regain and maintain self-motivation. So, how do you unlock those\ningredients?\n\n## A Toolkit for Self-Motivation\n\nWhile you cannot force self-motivation, you can create the perfect conditions\nfor cultivating a sense of self-efficacy, curiosity, and competence. By making\nsmall but meaningful changes, you\u2019ll set the stage for your motivation to\nemerge. I call those simple strategies the 3 Ms of Self-Motivation.\n\n  1. Manage your mood. It will be much harder to feel self-motivated if you are in a bad mood. Instead of brute-forcing your way to complete a task, take a little break to regulate your nervous system and cultivate a sense of calm. This could be through meditation, treating yourself to a nice, healthy meal, or having an interesting conversation break with a peer.\n  2. Measure your progress. This can be as simple as starting a spreadsheet where you count the number of words you have written, the number of days you have coded, or the number of times you went to the gym. Creating a streak can be extremely self-motivating as you won\u2019t want to break it. As a fun bonus, generating graphs can also make your progress easier to visualize\u2014see the GitHub contribution graph as an example.\n  3. Make it public. This is one of the most efficient ways to stay motivated over the long run. Working on a project with intrinsic motivation and adding the extrinsic motivation of a public commitment is a powerful combo. But do not only announce your project: make a pact to share regular updates, whether it\u2019s with your colleagues or on social media.\n\nManage your mood, measure your progress, make it public. These three simple\nsteps that can greatly help you get motivated, and more importantly, stay\nmotivated so you can achieve your most authentic ambitions, even on days when\nit\u2019s hard to get to work.\n\n## Join 80,000 mindful makers!\n\nMaker Mind is a weekly newsletter with science-based insights on creativity,\nmindful productivity, better thinking and lifelong learning.\n\nOne email a week, no spam, ever.
