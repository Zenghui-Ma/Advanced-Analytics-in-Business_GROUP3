Learn more in our security\ndocumentation.\n\n### What are the limitations of the developer preview?\n\nThese limitations are temporary. See our roadmap for more details.\n\n  * Code only has access to data you provide, which includes command-line arguments, environment variables, and stdin.\n  * No filesystem access.\n  * No network access.\n  * No external packages. Each interpreter has access to its language's standard library.\n  * No support for alternative interpreter versions.\n  * Execution time is limited to 30 seconds per invocation.\n  * Memory consumption is limited to 128Mib per invocation.\n\n### How much does it cost?\n\nDuring the developer preview the Code Interpreter API is free. We plan to\ncharge based on usage once the API reaches general availability.\n\n### Can I self-host the Code Interpreter API?\n\nSelf-hosting is offered at your request on a case-by-case basis. Send an email\nto sales@riza.io or schedule a call.\n\n### What's coming next?\n\nOur full roadmap is available in our documentation, but here are some\nhighlights:\n\n  * Allow interpreter customization via third-party packages and dependencies.\n  * Allow outbound network requests, with customer-defined hostname and IP allowlists.\n  * Allow filesystem access, with customer-defined capability controls.\n  * Add support for more languages, including compiled languages like Go, Java, and Rust.\n\nPlease send us an email or join us on Discord if you have questions or\nsuggestions.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Riza, Inc.
