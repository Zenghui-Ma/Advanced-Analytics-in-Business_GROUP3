In Germany the\nrelatively harmless movie (except for swearing) obtained the FSK 12 approval\nright away. The dirty language in the German translation does not play an\nimportant role anymore, because many phrases cannot be translated\ncorrespondingly or at all. In the meantime, an unrated version was released in\nthe USA because of the general trend of bringing out extended versions. With\nclever advertisement and a special cover design, film industry tried to raise\nsales of these versions, which seemingly appeared to be harder, more\npermissive or more appropriate for adults than the original version. The\noriginal cinematic version of \u201cEnemy of the State\u201d did not actually have many\nscenes which one might consider worth cutting for an r-rating. So it is\nsurprising that there are some changes. The unrated version shows numerous\nscenes which are typical of censorship. Whether the censorship was caused by\nrequirements of the MPAA or by precautionary self-censorship of the studio\nremains unknown. Overall, these extended scenes cover some minimal extension\nof violence e.g. when Will Smith finds the corpse of his ex-girlfriend.\nAdditionally, there are some dingy or erotic moments, as well as some\ndialogues, in which further nasty language is uttered.\n\nNonetheless, the unrated edition cannot fully convince, as some of the\nadditional scenes of the plot attract negative attention. Additional scenes of\nthe plot can more or less be rated after three different categories: First of\nall, scenes which contribute positively to the movie, scenes which are\nirrelevant for the movie but do not disrupt it either and scenes which add in\na negative way to the movie. Normally, the latter is the exception, despite\nthe inflationary wave of unrated movies. But not so in \u201cEnemy of the State\u201d.\nAt least the scenes at 0.42.15 and 1.58.46 are definitively contra-productive.\nOther scenes can at best be judged as neutral. Real enrichments are rare and\nthe additional action basically just extends the movie.\n\nOn the one hand. the extended version of \u201cEnemy of the State\u201d is uncut and\ngrown-up, but on the other hand it is senselessly longer and in places less\nbelievable and absurd.\n\n0.17.11 Extended plot scene At the end of talking to his superior, Jack Black,\nthe agent of telecommunication, receives the assignment to wiretap the natural\nscientist and says: \u201cYeah. A training op\u201d. 4,2 Sec.\n\n0.39.29 Extended plot scene While the agents are investigating the house of\nRobert Clayton (Will Smith), a short scene is missing. In this scene the ex-\nmarine says to his comrade: \u201cCome on. Let us get out of here\u201d. The reply is:\n\u201cShut up. I am enjoying myself\u201c. 1,5 Sec.\n\n0.39.30 Extended plot scene A fruit bowl is thrown off the table. 0,27 Sec. (8\nFrames)\n\n0.42.15 New plot scene The first new and longer scene after Will Smith was\nrowing with his lawyer friends:\n\nSmith moves up the stairs in his lawyer\u2019s office and meets a colleague. They\ngreet each other and Smith asks him to figure out, what happened to his friend\nfrom high-school, who was run over by a lorry after a chase. Smith\u2019s colleague\ncarefully writes down everything and jokes: \u201cGive me two days\u201d. Smith answers\nironically: \u201cYou got two hours\u201d. Both leave and there is a change of scene.\nBut first of all the pictures regarding to the latter scene:\n\n(Change of scene) What follows is a senseless scene which brings up more\nquestions than it answers. You can see the corrupt agents. Apparently, they\nare installing further bugging devices in the lawyer\u2019s office. On the toilet\nthey therefore unscrew the cover plate of some cables. The IT specialist is\nkeeping cave while the ex-marine is working on the plate. A staff member of\nthe laywer\u2019s office wants to use the toilet, but the agent tells him not to go\nin there because they would have a \u201cserious overflow\u201d. He also explains to him\nwhere to find another toilet. Meanwhile, the ex-marine successfully unscrewed\nthe cover plate on the toilet. What comes now is a little bit confusing: he\ntells the IT specialist that he should be in his place with his head jammed\nagainst the cover plate. Then he passes him the plate. When the IT guy takes\nthe cover plate, the ex-marine suddenly starts screaming madly (\u201cOw! Goddamn\nit! Ow!). The guy in front of the toilet and the IT specialist yell at him to\nkeep it down.\n\nNote:This additional footage indicates, why some of the scenes are at best\nsuitable for the deleted scenes. They are simply not adequate for the final\nversion of the movie. Despite watching the scene repeatedly, the viewer\nprobably cannot make any sense out of the action, e.g. why the marine starts\nscreaming and consequently risks the whole mission. Did he get an electric\nshock, did it smell or did something fall on his head? You do not know and\nthere is no explanation upcoming. Also, the IT specialist uses a flashlight\neven though the room is illuminated sufficiently. To cut a long story short,\nthis scene is needless and one might assume that it was only added to\ncontribute to the total running time, unfortunately in a negative way.\n\nA change of scene takes place, but for starters the pictures of this scene:\n\n< b>(Change of scene) Will Smith gets to his office. He greets his secretary,\ngoes to his bureau, puts a folder down on his desk and switches on his PC. He\nlogs in by using the password \u201cMingus\u201d. There follows a tracking shot over the\njust tapped cable and a cut to the agents who are aware of his password now.\nIt becomes obvious that Smith is filmed from the ceiling. The theatrical\nversion is on par with the extended version, when Smith is reading the\nnewspaper article regarding the FBI investigation on him. total 72,73 Sec.\n\n0.44.50 Extended plot scene When Smith comes home, after he was fired by his\nboss, there was added a very short insert into the DC, when he goes up the\nstairs in front of his house. In the DC a surveillant appears and says \u201cOh\nshit. Here he comes\u201d. He utters this only because he knows that Smith\u2019s wife\ncame to know about the continuing relationship of her husband to Rachel Banks\nfrom the newspaper; hence, he assumes Smith is in trouble. Note: It is\npossible that this and the scene after the next one were removed because the\nnext fitting scene consists of swearing only. All in all, the three scenes\nwere supposed to be inserted together. FETT]1,11 Sec.\n\n0.45.07 Censored scene, category: swearword Again a short insert of the agent\nwho says: \u201cHe\u2019s fucked\u201d, when Smith wants to get into his house to see his\nwife who is still reading in the newspaper. 1,8 Sec.\n\n0.45.47 Extended plot scene While Smith is arguing with his wife, the agent\nadds in an further insert: \u201dGod, this is just like my parents, man\u201d. 1,73 Sec.\n\n0.47.16 New plot scene After Smith tried to check in a luxurious hotel (which\ndid not work due to a cancelled credit card), a scene was added to the DC in\nwhich he tried to draw money from an ATM. The ATM informs him that his credit\ncard was cancelled and retains it. So Smith hits the ATM and leaves angrily.\n13 Sec.\n\n0.47.45 New plot scene In the evening Smith drives to a much cheaper hotel to\nstay there for the night. Exhaustedly he lies down, while on TV a senator is\nexplaining the advantages of the law that allows the state to observe any kind\nof telecommunication. Depressed Smith takes a look around, grabs an erotic\nmagazine (Penthouse) and starts to thumb through it. 35 Sec.\n\n0.52.43 Extended plot scene Smith sits down on a bench on the ferry and tries\nto discover Brill among the passengers. Many people take a strange look at\nhim. 8,73 Sec.\n\n0.52.53 Alternative scene When Smith disembarks, the DC shows a shot of a\nharbour policeman (1,53 Sec.). In the theatrical version you can see Smith\ndisembarking in the dawn a little bit longer (1 Sec.). All in all the DC is\ninsignificantly longer: 0,73 Sec.\n\ntheatrical version:| Director\u2019s Cut:  \n---|---  \n  \n1.14.04 Alternative scene In the scene Will Smith drives with the car of his\nhousekeeper to school. The surveillance team thinks of course that it is the\nhousekeeper and not him who is driving the car and so the man wearing glasses\nsays: \u201dOh man, let me follow the nanny\u201d. After this scene a blue filter was\napplied to the DC, when the car is driving on the road. This implies that you\nsee things as they are happening on the screen of the surveillance team. In\nthe theatrical version no filter is applied and it is a normal movie scene. No\ntime difference\n\ntheatrical version:| Director\u2019s Cut:  \n---|---  \n  \n1.14.11 Censored scene, category dingy You can see the housekeeper and she is\ndriving the car (blue filter applied). This scene is not contained in the\ntheatrical version. Next is footage that presumably is supposed to justify the\nunrated denotation. At least from a European point of view, it is not\ninteresting. The surveillant with glasses says another time (but this time\nmore aggressively): \u201cOne time, let me follow the nanny\u201d. Furthermore, he tells\nhis colleague, who is drinking something: \u201cYou know what that means, don\u2019t\nyou? With them hairy legs...\u201d. Thereupon he whistles like a bird and his\nfingers are mimicking a chirping bird, as well. His colleague looks aghast at\nhim and continues his explanation with the words \u201cDeep Dish Bush\u201d. His\ncolleague answers: \u201cYou are a sick fuck\u201d. 15,3 Sec.\n\n1.18.02 Censored scene, category: violence (alternative shot) Will Smith finds\nhis former girl friend, whom he had an affair with, on the floor of the\nbathroom. In the DC he sees through the door gap a puddle of blood on the\nfloor. In the theatrical version he stands a bit longer in the door. no time\ndifference\n\ntheatrical version:| Director\u2019s Cut:  \n---|---  \n  \n1.18.20 Censored scene, category: violence In the unrated version a further\nshot shows the corpse. 1,53 Sec.\n\n1.22.09 Extended plot scene The scene, in which the surveillance team\nevaluates the satellite photos from Smith and Hackman and argue about that the\nsatellite can be arranged downwards only, was marginally extended in the DC.\nThe guy with glasses says: \u201dLet me talk to the nanny. Maybe she can help\u201d. His\ncolleague replies: \u201dThat\u2019s a good idea, Fiedler\u201d, and then Fiedler laughs.\n\nNote: Probably the scene was removed because it alludes to the likewise\nremoved scene of the theatrical version at 1.14.11. 6,37 Sec.\n\n1.23.55 Extended plot scene When the NSA analyses the photos from the gas\nstation\u2019s camera showing Brill, the scene was extended. The perpetrator\nstates: \u201cSee you later then\u201d and leaves. One of the other guys remarks:\n\u201cThat\u2019s all we can do at this point?\u201d, and the one with glasses responds\naggressively: \u201cSqueeze me at this point. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d 6,03 Sec.\n\n1.30.37 Extended plot scene The car chase on the railway property was extended\nin the DC. 6,13 Sec.\n\n1.31.37 Extended plot scene After Will Smith gets rid of his burning coat,\nanother short shot of Smith in front of the flames was added to the DC. And he\npicks up the shotgun again. 2,27 Sec.\n\n1.38.20 New plot scene Smith and Hackman are driving on the motorway, after\nthey finally decided to strike back. In the theatrical version you can just\nsee the van driving on the street, followed by the next scene. Contrary,\nanother talk was inserted into the DC: Smith asks Hackman whether he would\nlike a pretzel, an apple or a cookie. Hackman goes for the cookie. Smith does\napparently not want to give the cookie away, takes another look into the bag\nand pretends not to have heard Hackman\u2019s answer and asks again. But this time\nhe only gives the choice of apple and pretzel. Hackman is no fool and insists\non the cookie. Smith passes the bag and Hackman asks whether he had any\nchildren. He learns that Smith has an eight year old son. Hackman changes the\ntopic and wants to know what Smith knows about hacking cell phones. Smith\nresponds that he normally just pushes the send button. A little bit confused\nHackman tells him: \u201cGreat. You will be a great help\u201d. Smith looks at him und\nwonders where the cookie is. \u201cIt is really good\u201d, expresses Hackman. 32,13\nSec.\n\n1.40.28 Extended plot scene While Smith and Hackman are monitoring the\ndelegate, another scene was inserted. Smith wonders how one stumbles into such\na line of work. Hackman explains that when he was 12 his father had a grocery\nstore. He thought one of his partners would steal from him. As a result of\nthis, the young Hackman found a way to tap the telephone of his father\u2019s\npartner. He goes on by saying that he enjoyed listening to the man without\nbeing recognized. \u201cAnd did he steal\u201d, Smith wants to know and Hackman\u2019s answer\nis simply \u201cYeah\u201d. In the theatrical version Hackman is typing on his notebook.\nThis scene is not contained in the DC. (0,68 Sec.) 15,17 Sec.\n\n1.40.48 Censored scene, category: erotic In the DC there was a short shot\nadded in which you can see the secretary, dressed in underwear, with whom the\ncongressman is cheating on his wife. 1,47 Sec.\n\n1.40.54 Censored scene, category: erotic After the secretary took off the\ncongressmans\u2019 shirt, new footage was inserted: Smith is looking a bit puzzled.\nHe remarks: \u201cThere\u2019s our hard-earned tax dollars at work\u201d. Hackman nods. This\nis followed by a cut that reveals the goings in the room of the congressman.\nThe secretary is slowly licking over the congressman\u2019s chest. Smith\u2019s comment:\n\u201cGod bless America\u201d. Then she unties his trousers. 11,63 Sec.\n\n1.40.59 Censored scene, category: erotic The congressman leans back and his\nsecretary continues kissing his belly while she is heavily breathing. 3,2 Sec.\n\n1.41.01 Extended plot scene After the \u201cshow\u201d in the congressman\u2019s apartment,\nSmith is still looking stunned, sights and sinks on the bed. Hackman asks him\nwhat the matter was. Smith says that he just considered how he would have\nfelt, if someone was watching him doing things like that. Hereupon Hackman:\n\u201cNow you now how Pintero felt. 14,2 Sec.\n\n1.41.59 Extended plot scene The DC scene was extended after Hackman, who was\nlet in by the Spanish housekeeper, is bugging Reynolds\u2019 house. She continues\nspeaking Spanish while Hackman enters and puts down his stuff. He begins\nlooking for things which are appropriate for bugging. He discovers the girl on\nthe sofa and greets her. Shyly she welcomes him. Hereupon, Hackman goes on\nsearching the living room. He takes a look at the telephone and unplugs the\nreceiver. He looks through his stuff and replaces the receiver by an identical\none. 54,53 Sec.\n\n1.42.42 Censored scene, category: swearword When the technician explains to\nReynolds that all bugs were custom made by them, Raynolds angrily says: \u201eYou\nthink this is fucking amusing?\u201c. The technician lowers his head. 3,17 Sec.\n\n1.58.44 Alternative scene In the DC there is a slight alternation of the shot\nin which the wounded technician Jack Black is driven to hospital after the\nfinal massacre. Theatrical version: 2,2 Sec. Director\u2019s Cut: 3,21 Sec. The\nalternative shot was only used, because a new scene is following in the DC\n(see below).\n\nTheatrical version:| Director\u2019s Cut:  \n---|---  \n  \n1.58.46 New plot scene After the shot-out Smith goes to the surveillance van\nof the NSA, which is being examined by the FBI. Smith asks them: \u201cExcuse me,\nthere was a guy in here with a cop uniform. An agent responds: \u201cThe guy with\nthe bloody hand?\u201d. Smith approves this and she continues: \u201cYeah, we have him\non surveillance tape\u201d. The agent asks her colleague to rewind the tape. On the\nscreen you can see how Hackman disappears. She takes a closer look at the\nscreen and wonders if he had a cat under his arm. Smith is eased, laughs and\nthanks the agent.\n\nNote: This scene cannot persuade. Even though the FBI agent should know from\nnewspapers and their observation that Smith is not an agent himself but still\na suspect, she readily and smilingly gives him information and lets him watch\nthe surveillance tape. 33,62 Sec.  \n  \n  * Staff\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Data Protection\n  * Contact\n\n", "frontpage": false}
