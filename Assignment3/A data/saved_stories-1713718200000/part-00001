An African American freedman, he is said\nto have worked as a \"steel-driving man\"\u2014a man tasked with hammering a steel\ndrill into a rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock in\nconstructing a railroad tunnel.\n\nThe story of John Henry is told in a classic blues folk song about his duel\nagainst a drilling machine, which exists in many versions, and has been the\nsubject of numerous stories, plays, books, and novels.^[1]^[2]\n\n## Legend[edit]\n\nPlaque celebrating the legend of John Henry (Talcott, West Virginia)\n\nAccording to legend, John Henry's prowess as a steel driver was measured in a\nrace against a steam-powered rock drill, a race that he won only to die in\nvictory with a hammer in hand as his heart gave out from stress. Various\nlocations, including Big Bend Tunnel in West Virginia,^[3] Lewis Tunnel in\nVirginia, and Coosa Mountain Tunnel in Alabama, have been suggested as the\nsite of the contest.\n\nThe contest involved John Henry as the hammerman working in partnership with a\nshaker, who would hold a chisel-like drill against mountain rock, while the\nhammerman struck a blow with a hammer. Then the shaker would begin rocking and\nrolling: wiggling and rotating the drill to optimize its bite. The steam drill\nmachine could drill but it could not shake the chippings away, so its bit\ncould not drill further and frequently broke down.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe historical accuracy of many of the aspects of the John Henry legend are\nsubject to debate.^[1]^[2] According to researcher Scott Reynolds Nelson, the\nactual John Henry was born in 1848 in New Jersey and died of silicosis and not\ndue to exhaustion of work.^[4]\n\nSeveral locations have been put forth for the tunnel on which John Henry died.\n\n### Big Bend Tunnel[edit]\n\nSociologist, Guy B. Johnson, investigated the legend of John Henry in the late\n1920s. He concluded that John Henry might have worked on the Chesapeake and\nOhio Railway's (C&O Railway) Big Bend Tunnel but that \"one can make out a case\neither for or against\" it.^[5]^[3] That tunnel was built near Talcott, West\nVirginia, from 1870 to 1872 (according to Johnson's dating), and named for the\nbig bend in the Greenbrier River nearby.\n\nSome versions of the song refer to the location of John Henry's death as \"The\nBig Bend Tunnel on the C. & O.\"^[3] In 1927, Johnson visited the area and\nfound one man who said he had seen it.\n\n> This man, known as Neal Miller, told me in plain words how he had come to\n> the tunnel with his father at 17, how he carried water and drills for the\n> steel drivers, how he saw John Henry every day, and, finally, all about the\n> contest between John Henry and the steam drill.\n>\n> \"When the agent for the steam drill company brought the drill here,\" said\n> Mr. Miller, \"John Henry wanted to drive against it. He took a lot of pride\n> in his work and he hated to see a machine take the work of men like him.\n>\n> \"Well, they decided to hold a test to get an idea of how practical the steam\n> drill was. The test went on all day and part of the next day.\n>\n> \"John Henry won. He wouldn't rest enough, and he overdid. He took sick and\n> died soon after that.\"\n>\n> Mr. Miller described the steam drill in detail. I made a sketch of it and\n> later when I looked up pictures of the early steam drills, I found his\n> description correct. I asked people about Mr. Miller's reputation, and they\n> all said, \"If Neal Miller said anything happened, it happened.\"^[6]\n\nWhen Johnson contacted Chief Engineer C. W. Johns of the C&O Railroad\nregarding Big Bend Tunnel, Johns replied that \"no steam drills were ever used\nin this tunnel.\" When asked about documentation from the period, Johns replied\nthat \"all such papers have been destroyed by fire.\"^[5]\n\nTalcott holds a yearly festival named for Henry, and a statue and memorial\nplaque have been placed in John Henry Historical Park at the eastern end of\nthe tunnel.^[7]\n\n### Lewis Tunnel[edit]\n\nIn the 2006 book Steel Drivin' Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an\nAmerican Legend, historian Scott Reynolds Nelson detailed his discovering\ndocumentation of a 19-year-old African-American man alternately referred to as\nJohn Henry, John W. Henry, or John William Henry in previously unexplored\nprison records of the Virginia Penitentiary. At the time, penitentiary inmates\nwere hired out as laborers to various contractors, and this John Henry was\nnotated as having headed the first group of prisoners to be assigned tunnel\nwork. Nelson also discovered the C&O's tunneling records, which the company\nbelieved had been destroyed by fire. Henry, like many African Americans, might\nhave come to Virginia to work on the clean-up of the battlefields after the\nCivil War. Arrested and tried for burglary, John Henry was in the first group\nof convicts released by the warden to work as leased labor on the C&O\nRailway.^[8]^: 39\n\nAccording to Nelson, objectionable conditions at the Virginia prison led the\nwarden to believe that the prisoners, many of whom had been arrested on\ntrivial charges, would be better clothed and fed if they were released as\nlaborers to private contractors. (He subsequently changed his mind about this\nand became an opponent of the convict labor system.) In the C&O's tunneling\nrecords, Nelson found no evidence of a steam drill used in Big Bend\nTunnel.^[9]\n\nThe records Nelson found indicate that the contest took place 40 miles (64 km)\naway at the Lewis Tunnel, between Talcott and Millboro, Virginia, where\nprisoners did indeed work beside steam drills night and day.^[10] Nelson also\nargues that the verses of the ballad about John Henry being buried near \"the\nwhite house,\" \"in the sand,\" somewhere that locomotives roar, mean that\nHenry's body was buried in a ditch behind the so-called white house of the\nVirginia State Penitentiary, which photos from that time indicate was painted\nwhite, and where numerous unmarked graves have been found.^[11]\n\nPrison records for John William Henry stopped in 1873, suggesting that he was\nkept on the record books until it was clear that he was not coming back and\nhad died. Nelson stresses that John Henry would have been representative of\nthe many hundreds of convict laborers who were killed in unknown circumstances\ntunneling through the mountains or who died shortly afterwards of silicosis\nfrom dust created by the drills and blasting.\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\nThis article may contain irrelevant references to popular culture. Please\nremove the content or add citations to reliable and independent sources. (June\n2018)  \n---  \n  \nThe tale of John Henry has been used as a symbol in many cultural movements,\nincluding labor movements^[12] and the Civil Rights Movement.^[13] Philosopher\nJeanette Bickell said of the John Henry legend:\n\n> John Henry is a symbol of physical strength and endurance, of exploited\n> labor, of the dignity of a human being against the degradations of the\n> machine age, and of racial pride and solidarity. During World War II his\n> image was used in U.S. government propaganda as a symbol of social tolerance\n> and diversity.^[14]\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n  * In 1995, John Henry was portrayed in the movie Tall Tale by Roger Aaron Brown. A former slave, John Henry appears to a runaway farmer's son named Daniel to both protect him from ruffians (alongside fellow folk hero figures Daniel's father told his son about, Pecos Bill and Paul Bunyan) and impart life lesson wisdom to him.\n  * In 2018, a film centered around characters from classic American folklore titled John Henry and the Statesmen was announced to be in development. Intended to be the start of a new film franchise, it includes Dwayne Johnson cast to portray John Henry. Jake Kasdan will serve as director, based on the original story by Tom Wheeler and Hiram Garcia. Johnson, Garcia, Kasdan, and Beau Flynn will serve as producers. The project will be a joint-venture production between Seven Bucks Productions, Netflix Original Films, and Flynn Picture Company; and distributed by Netflix as a streaming exclusive movie.^[15] In November 2021, producer Hiram Garcia stated that development on the project continues, while confirming that the most recent draft of the script had been completed while it requires additional work.^[16]\n  * In 2020, Terry Crews played a modern-day adaptation of the character in John Henry. The plot centers around a former gang member who takes in two young teens who are on the run from the leader of his past. The film was released by Saban Films.^[17]\n\n#### Animation[edit]\n\n  * In 1946, animator George Pal adapted the tale of John Henry into a short film titled John Henry and the Inky-Poo as part of his theatrical stop-motion Puppetoons series. The short is considered a milestone in American cinema as one of the first films to have a positive view of African-American folklore.^[18]^[19]\n  * In 1974, Nick Bosustow and David Adams co-produced an 11-minute animated short, The Legend of John Henry, for Paramount Pictures.^[20]\n  * The character appears in a Walt Disney Feature Animation short film, John Henry (2000). Directed by Mark Henn, plans for theatrical releases in 2000 and 2001 fell through after the short had a limited Academy Award qualifying run in Los Angeles;^[21] a shorter version was released as the only new entry in the direct-to-video release Disney's American Legends (2001). It was eventually released in its original format as an interstitial on the Disney Channel, and later as part of the home video compilation Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection in 2015.\n  * The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy Season 6 episode \"Short Tall Tales\" shows a parody of John Henry's tale with Irwin in the role. Grim decides to sabotage the story by powering up the drilling machine to go faster, and Irwin forces himself to hammer through the mountain faster to surpass it, but by doing so he ends up breaking into the 8th dimension, where aliens feed him to one of their giant monstrous females.\n  * John Henry is featured in the 20th episode of Season 5 of Teen Titans Go!, \"Tall Titan Tales\".\n  * John Henry appears in the Pinky and the Brain episode \"A Legendary Tail\".\n  * John Henry appears in a segment of the short-lived Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures TV series. In an episode titled \"Pocket Watch Full of Miracles\", which aired in November 1990, John Henry is portrayed as having the mannerisms of Muhammad Ali. He challenges and beats a steam-powered hammer driven by his boss. His prize is an antique pocket watch owned by Queen Victoria. The watch is given to the titular Bill and Ted, only to be immediately destroyed by a runaway train.\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n  * Danny Glover played the character in the series, Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales & Legends from 1985 to 1987. Shelley Duvall served as the series' creator, presenter, narrator, and executive producer. The show aired on Showtime Network as well as Disney Channel, and received a Primetime Emmy Award.\n  * John Henry is briefly mentioned in an episode of 30 Rock, during season 6 titled \"The Ballad of Kenneth Parcell\".\n  * In Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles season 2 episode 10 John Henry is introduced both as the name of ZeiraCorp's A.I. and as the tale of a man who is unable to halt progress.\n  * On the Adult Swim series, Saul of the Mole Men, John Henry (played by Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister) has been living at the centre of the Earth since his victory over the steam drill, having become a cyborg at sometime in the intervening centuries. He befriends and later sacrifices himself to save protagonist Saul Malone.^[22]\n  * In the season 5, episode 15, \"Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy\" of Monk, Dr. Kroger sings a couple of stanzas to Monk during Monk's therapy session to remind him that Monk never needed technology before as he became a phenomenal detective.\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\nDestination Freedom, a 1950's American old time radio series written by\nRichard Durham, featured John Henry in a July 1949 episode.^[23]\n\n### Music[edit]\n\nThe story of John Henry is traditionally told through two types of songs:\nballads, commonly called \"The Ballad of John Henry\", and \"hammer songs\" (a\ntype of work song), each with wide-ranging and varying lyrics.^[2]^[24] Some\nsongs, and some early folk historian research, conflate the songs about John\nHenry with those of John Hardy, a West Virginian outlaw.^[24] Ballads about\nJohn Henry's life typically contain four major components: a premonition by\nJohn Henry as a child that steel-driving would lead to his death, the lead-up\nto and the results of the legendary race against the steam hammer, Henry's\ndeath and burial, and the reaction of his wife.^[24]\n\nThe well-known narrative ballad of \"John Henry\" is usually sung in an upbeat\ntempo. Hammer songs associated with the \"John Henry\" ballad, however, are not.\nSung more slowly and deliberately, often with a pulsating beat suggestive of\nswinging the hammer, these songs usually contain the lines \"This old hammer\nkilled John Henry / but it won't kill me.\" Nelson explains that:\n\n> ... workers managed their labor by setting a \"stint,\" or pace, for it. Men\n> who violated the stint were shunned ... Here was a song that told you what\n> happened to men who worked too fast: they died ugly deaths; their entrails\n> fell on the ground. You sang the song slowly, you worked slowly, you guarded\n> your life, or you died.^[8]^: 32\n\nThere is some controversy among scholars over which came first, the ballad or\nthe hammer songs. Some scholars have suggested that the \"John Henry\" ballad\ngrew out of the hammer songs, while others believe that the two were always\nentirely separate.\n\nSongs featuring the story of John Henry have been recorded by many musical\nartists and bands of different ethnic backgrounds. These include:\n\n  * The Williamson Brothers & Curry\n\n    \"Gonna Die With My Hammer in My Hand\", recorded in 1927 and compiled in the Anthology of American Folk Music (1952)^[25]\n\n  * Henry Thomas^[26]\n  * Charley Crockett\n  * Mississippi Fred McDowell (on Ann Arbor Blues Festival 1969: Vols 1&2^[27])\n  * Doc Watson\n  * Burl Ives\n  * John Hartford (on Goin' Back to Dixie)\n  * Cannonball Adderley \u2013 Big Man: The Legend of John Henry\n  * Bill Monroe\n  * John Hartford (on Goin' Back to Dixie)\n  * The New Christy Minstrels\n\n    \"John Henry and the Steam Drill\" and \"Natural Man\", both on Land of Giants (1964)^[28]\n\n  * Dave Van Ronk Dave Van Ronk Sings Ballads, Blues, and a Spiritual\n  * Kabir Suman\n  * Hemanga Biswas\n  * Johnny Cash^[29]\n  * Drive-By Truckers (on their The Dirty South album)\n  * Joe Bonamassa^[24]\n  * Furry Lewis^[2]\n  * Big Bill Broonzy^[2]\n  * Pink Anderson^[24]\n  * Fiddlin' John Carson^[24]\n  * Uncle Dave Macon^[24]\n  * J.

J. Lankes. The novel was adapted into a stage musical in 1940, starring Paul Robeson in the title role.^[2] According to Steven Carl Tracy, Bradford's works were influential in broadly popularizing the John Henry legend beyond railroad and mining communities and outside of African American oral histories.^[2]\n  * In a 1933 article published in The Journal of Negro Education, Bradford's John Henry was criticized for \"making over a folk-hero into a clown.\"^[45] A 1948 obituary for Bradford described John Henry as \"a better piece of native folklore than Paul Bunyan.\"^[46]\n  * Ezra Jack Keats's John Henry: An American Legend, published in 1965, is a notable picture book chronicling the history of John Henry and portraying him as the \"personification of the medieval Everyman who struggles against insurmountable odds and wins.\"^[13]\n  * Colson Whitehead's 2001 novel John Henry Days uses the John Henry myth as story background.
