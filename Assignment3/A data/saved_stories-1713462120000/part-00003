States are\nstepping in with tax breaks and zoning changes to help cities and suburbs\nreplace vacant office space with much-needed housing. (Bebeto Matthews/The\nAssociated Press)\n\nRead more Stateline coverage of how communities across the country are trying\nto create more affordable housing.\n\nHERNDON, Va. \u2014 Juan Ramirez, watching his dog play in Chandon Park here in\nsuburban Virginia on a Saturday morning, tries to imagine the massive office\nbuildings next to the park becoming apartments and townhouses.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s inevitable. People don\u2019t use offices as much now. I hope it\u2019s\naffordable. Maybe it\u2019ll bring more young people to town, more taxes for\nparks,\u201d said Ramirez, 38, who grew up in the area and returned recently to\ntake a restaurant management job after living in Minnesota and Ohio.\n\nCities and suburbs around the country are struggling with vacant office space\nas remote work becomes an established post-pandemic reality. States are\nstepping in with tax breaks and zoning changes to help replace the unwanted\ncubicle farms with much-needed housing. In suburbs such as Herndon, the answer\nmight be tearing down an office complex and replacing it with a residential\nbuilding. In more urban environments it might mean renovating and retrofitting\noffice buildings to create apartments.\n\nJuan Ramirez, right, at a dog park in Herndon, Va., said he hopes new housing\nwill bring more affordability and young people to the suburban area where he\ngrew up. In the background are vacant offices slated to be torn down to build\napartments and townhouses. (Tim Henderson/Stateline)\n\n\u201cOffice vacancy has climbed to a 30-year high and at the same time there\u2019s a\nhousing shortage. So naturally the question is, \u2018Why can we not convert all\nthese vacant office buildings into housing?\u2019\u201d said Jessica Morin, research\ndirector for CBRE, a commercial real estate firm. CBRE research shows\nconverting offices to other uses, mostly housing, is set to peak this year at\nmore than 20 million square feet, up from 6.3 million in 2021.\n\nSome places that started conversions before the pandemic are leading the way:\nNew York state and New York City changed their laws during a 1990s downturn to\nallow more office-to-apartment conversions in Manhattan, although now there\u2019s\na state vs. city standoff on zoning rules to convert newer offices.\n\nOhio, where interest in city living grew when Cleveland spruced up its\ndowntown for the 2016 Republican convention, now has three cities \u2014 Cleveland,\nCincinnati and Columbus \u2014 in the top 15 list for office conversions to\nhousing, according to CBRE.\n\nNationwide, 119 office conversion projects, including for residential and\nother use, are under construction or were completed this year, the most since\nCBRE began tracking them in 2016. Those projects could add about 44,000 new\nhousing units when completed.\n\nSince 2016, projects representing 125 million square feet of offices have or\nare slated to be converted to other uses, usually to housing but sometimes to\nwarehouses or laboratories. But despite the recent increase, that represents\nonly about 2% of all U.S. office space.\n\nImpediments to making apartments out of offices include the still-high value\nof office buildings in some downtown areas in cities such as San Francisco,\nand the cost of demolishing or refitting old office buildings with plumbing\nfor individual kitchens and bathrooms. Many office buildings also lack windows\nwith natural light, which apartment-dwellers often demand.\n\nThat\u2019s why state incentives have played a large part, as well as streamlined\nzoning that makes project costs more predictable for developers. Some states\nare further along than others. A new California law allows residential\n\u201cbuilding by right\u201d in office and other commercial zones, meaning developers\ndon\u2019t have to petition for a zoning change. Washington state passed a law last\nyear requiring cities to ease zoning requirements for housing in existing\ncommercial buildings. And an Arizona bill signed into law this month will\nallow larger cities to convert more commercial buildings into housing without\nzoning changes.\n\nPredictable zoning rules are important to developers who don\u2019t want to get\nbogged down in negotiations and refusals that could sink a project.\n\n\u201cDevelopers just urge their states and localities to be really transparent,\nstreamline the process, make the unknowns limited, because it\u2019s the unknowns\nthat drive risks,\u201d said Julie Whelan, a vice president at CBRE. \u201cOtherwise,\nthey\u2019re going to go look at the next pasture.\u201d\n\n#### Incentive programs\n\nIn addition to the Ohio cities, Chicago; Dallas/Fort Worth; Houston; Hartford\nand Fairfield County in Connecticut; the Kansas City metro area; Louisville,\nKentucky; Minneapolis/St. Paul; Pittsburgh; Milwaukee; New Jersey; and\nWashington, D.C., are on CBRE\u2019s top 15 list for rate of office space converted\nto apartments.\n\nOhio has two incentive programs for office conversion to housing. A 2020\nprogram for \u201ctransformational\u201d projects that could spur further development\nhelped convert four floors of offices to apartments under construction at\nPlayhouse Square in Cleveland. A historic building preservation incentive in\nplace since 2007 helped partly convert Carew Tower in Cincinnati to\napartments, said Mason Waldvogel, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of\nDevelopment.\n\nMissouri is hoping to replicate that success in St. Louis, where about a\nquarter of the commercial space, including offices, is vacant. That includes\nthe massive 44-story One AT&T Building downtown, with almost 1.5 million\nsquare feet, that sold for $3.6 million this month, compared with $205 million\nin 2006.\n\nMissouri state Sen. Steven Roberts, a Democrat who represents the downtown St.\nLouis area, said a bill he\u2019s sponsoring has bipartisan support from suburban\nRepublicans, and is aimed at creating downtown areas in St. Louis and\nelsewhere where people can live, shop and eat as well as work. The bill was\nvoted out of committee in February and is awaiting consideration by the full\nSenate.\n\nThe bill would create a state tax credit for up to 30% of the cost of\nconverting office space to housing, retail or other uses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a creative workaround to make downtown more vibrant and successful. We\nwant to get more restaurants, more stores, more nightlife \u2014 and the way to do\nthat is to get more people living there,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue for\ndowntown and also for the whole state.\u201d\n\nOther states have enacted laws to encourage more conversion of offices to\nhousing, according to a Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank report last year.\nLaws passed by Florida and Montana in 2023 allow new and converted multifamily\nhousing in commercial areas, and laws in Rhode Island and Wisconsin support\nconversion of existing commercial and office buildings.\n\nA Colorado bill now in committee would provide tax credits for commercial\nconversion to housing starting in 2026, supporting Denver\u2019s plans to\ntransition its office-oriented Central Business District to a \u201cCentral\nNeighborhood District.\u201d Denver identified 16 commercial buildings as prime\ncandidates for housing.\n\n#### Zoning changes\n\nStarting in the mid-1990s, a combination of state and city laws helped\ntransform lower Manhattan\u2019s business district with more apartments, a process\nthat accelerated after 9/11. A proposal by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to\nexpand the program to newer buildings failed to pass the legislature as part\nof a broader measure that included requirements for suburban and upstate\ncommunities to build more housing. Negotiations are continuing with lawmakers\nto make the change for New York City this year.\n\nWhen you have a 20% office vacancy rate and a 1.4% rental apartment vacancy\nrate, it makes a lot of sense to substitute one for the other.\n\n\u2013 Casey Berkovitz, spokesperson for the New York City Department of City\nPlanning\n\nNew York City also has begun working on its own rules to allow office-to-\nhousing conversions citywide for buildings built before 1990, said Casey\nBerkovitz, spokesperson for the Department of City Planning. The state could\ndo it faster and could also create tax incentives that the city cannot create\non its own, and that\u2019s also part of current negotiations with the state\nlegislature, Berkovitz said.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a 20% office vacancy rate and a 1.4% rental apartment vacancy\nrate, it makes a lot of sense to substitute one for the other,\u201d Berkovitz\nsaid. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our own regulations standing in the way of that if it\nmakes financial sense.\u201d\n\nIn Herndon, town officials last month approved a zoning change that would\nclear the way for demolition of the Worldgate Drive offices and the\nconstruction of a combination of rental apartments, townhouses and \u201ctwo over\ntwo\u201d units with accessory living areas an owner can rent out or share with\nfamily members. All apartments would be market rate without subsidized\naffordable units, Ken Wire, an attorney for the developer, Boston Properties,\nsaid at last month\u2019s hearing on the zoning change.\n\n\u201cWe believe that by providing more housing in the area, we are adding to the\noverall supply, which thereby reduces price pressures in the market,\u201d Wire\nsaid.\n\nA vacant former government office complex at 13100-13150 Worldgate Drive in\nHerndon, Va., is slated for demolition to build apartments and townhouses.\n(Tim Henderson/Stateline)\n\nA vacant former government office complex at 13100-13150 Worldgate Drive in\nHerndon, Va., is slated for demolition to build apartments and townhouses. Tim\nHenderson/Stateline\n\nVirginia considered two state Senate bills this session that would have\ncreated incentives to convert offices to apartments but neither has passed,\nsaid Allison Brown, policy associate for the nonprofit Virginia Housing\nAlliance. One would have created a state income tax credit for office-to-\nresidential conversion, and another would have allowed more residential\nbuilding in commercial areas if they included affordable housing.\n\nThe Worldgate Drive housing plan may spur Herndon to change its zoning rules\nto allow similar projects without zoning changes, said Elizabeth Gilleran, the\ntown\u2019s director of community development.\n\nHerndon wants to \u201cretain its sense of community and historic small-town feel\u201d\nbut also keep a strong commercial tax base that has helped support the town\u2019s\ntax coffers when home values inevitably rise and fall, Gilleran said. The town\nrecently approved conversion of a small office park and a hotel to homes. But\noffices and other commercial buildings will remain a key component of the\ntown\u2019s suburban building mix as density grows with a recent new commuter rail\nstop that opened in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe town doesn\u2019t wish to become a bedroom community,\u201d Gilleran said.\n\nStateline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by\ngrants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
