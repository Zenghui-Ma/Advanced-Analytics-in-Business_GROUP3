Salehpour said the boss insinuated that he should instead\nkeep quiet.\n\nBoeing has denied any safety lapses in its 787 planes, telling Business\nInsider on Wednesday that \"a 787 can safely operate for at least 30 years\nbefore needing expanded airframe maintenance routines.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalehpour also said his boss retaliated against him by keeping him out of\nmeetings, silencing him, transferring his department, making him cancel doctor\nappointments, and calling his personal phone to \"berate\" him.\n\n\"It reminds me of, ya know, people who stalk people,\" Salehpour said at the\nhearing, noting he has a work phone his manager could call him on. \"They call\nyou on your personal phone to let you know that they know where you live, they\nknow where you are, and they can hurt you.\"\n\nSalehpour \u2014 who said he still has his job thanks to whistleblower-protection\nlaws \u2014 told lawmakers that has has also received threats against his physical\nsafety.\n\nA photo of a nail in Salehpour's car tire was shown at the Wednesday hearing,\nwhich he said a mechanic told him was intentionally put there and not\nsomething the tire picked up on the road. He told lawmakers that although he\nhas \"no proof\" of where or who the nail came from, he believes it happened at\nwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) presented a picture of the nail that Sam\nSalehpour believes was intentionally put in his tire. Drew Angerer/AFP via\nGetty Images\n\nIn another instance, Salehpour told lawmakers that his boss once said in a\nmeeting that he \"would have killed someone who said what you said.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nSalehpour said this retaliation is part of a greater trend at Boeing, where\nengineers are threatened into overlooking quality concerns due to a culture\nthat puts \"schedule over safety\" and punishes employees for speaking up.\n\nOne case Salehpour told lawmakers involved his colleague inspecting 787\nfuselage gaps that could have debris, and the boss suggested he should not\nstop production over the concern.\n\n\"The attitude at Boeing from the highest level is just to push the defective\nparts regardless of what it is, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoeing told BI that it encourages transparency with its employees and that\nreports have skyrocketed since the Alaska Airlines 737 Max blowout in January.\n\n\"There has been a more than 500% increase in employee reports through our\n\"Speak Up\" portal compared to 2023, which signals progress toward a robust\nreporting culture that is not fearful of retaliation,\" the company said.\n\n## Boeing backs its widebodies\n\nWednesday's hearing came a week after Salehpour's whistleblower complaint to\naviation regulators became public.\n\nSalehpour, who has worked on both the 777 and 787 assembly lines, said he\nwitnessed misaligned parts that could more quickly fatigue over time and\npotentially lead to a catastrophic event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoeing 787s at Boeing's Washington assembly line, taken in June 2022. Taylor\nRains/Business Insider\n\n\"After the threats and after all this, it really scares me, but I am at\npeace,\" Salehpour said. \"If something happens to me, I am at peace because I\nfeel like by coming forward, I will be saving a lot of lives.\"\n\nBoeing has backed its widebody planes despite Salehpour's complaint, telling\nBI in an email statement prior to the hearing that the allegations are not\nrepresentative of the work it has done to \"ensure the quality and long-term\nsafety of the aircraft.\"\n\n\"Extensive and rigorous testing of the fuselage and heavy maintenance checks\nof nearly 700 in-service airplanes to date have found zero evidence of\nairframe fatigue,\" Boeing told BI, referring to its 787 Dreamliners.\n\n\"Under FAA oversight, we have painstakingly inspected and reworked airplanes\nand improved production quality to meet exacting standards that are measured\nin the one-hundredths of an inch,\" it continued.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: 5 times unruly passengers disrupted flights in 2023\n\nBoeing Aviation Airlines\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
