I spend it obsessively clicking-through The Knot;\ncreating budget spreadsheets with intricate formulas that far surpass my high\nschool math knowledge; and driving on the weekends to obscure towns in upstate\nMaine to tour wedding venues with my fiance.\n\nAll of which is to say: I have been desperate for help.\n\nBut I didn\u2018t want to put the burden on friends and family \u2014 instead, I thought\nI\u2019d leverage AI to see how well a robot could plan my wedding.\n\n## I Asked AI to Plan My Wedding: Here's How It Went\n\n### First Up: My Wedding Venue\n\nFor starters, I asked ChatGPT for a list of wedding venues in Maine within\n3-hours of Boston.\n\nMy requirements were simple, I wanted:\n\n  * A beach or lakefront property\n  * The option for an indoor barn reception\n  * Onsite accommodations for friends and family\n  * Catering and bar included\n  * An upscale, rustic, elegant, yet fun vibe\n\nEasy peasy, right?\n\nHere's what my lovely wedding-planner-robot spit back:\n\nFrom there, ChatGPT encouraged me to email the vendors directly \u2013 except I\ndidn't want to go through the trouble without seeing some images of each\nvenue.\n\nSo I asked ChatGPT and got \u2013 no help whatsoever back:\n\nOkay, fine, fine \u2013 I'll have to grab pictures the ol\u2019 fashioned way. It could\nat least pull reviews though, right?\n\nNow that I'm batting 0 for 2, I decided to take a quick break from ChatGPT to\nperuse the websites of the vendors it sent along.\n\nSome of them were promising. Others didn\u2018t quite match my requirements \u2013 like\nthe Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge, which is stunning but a 3.5 hour drive from Boston;\nplus, some of the others don\u2018t offer a barn space like I\u2019d asked.\n\nHowever, I was happy to add some to my list. While it seems AI is a great tool\nto use for initial venue list collection, it doesn't offer much to help me\nwhittle my list down.\n\nFor that, I'll return dejectedly to my spreadsheets, websites, and long back-\nand-forth email threads.\n\n### Next: My Wedding Aesthetic\n\nI decided to segue off the venue-hunt for the time-being and switch gears:\nWhat about florals? And color palette? Could AI help me with all of that?\n\nEarthy tones like sand, driftwood brown, and sage green? Mason jars filled\nwith wildflowers? Candles in hurricane vases?\n\nNow we're talking.\n\nI was wildly impressed by AI's ability to help me start to narrow down the\ntypes of floral arrangements, table settings, color palette, and lighting I\nshould lean into to match my theme.\n\nIn fact, this gave me plenty of confidence that I likely don\u2018t need a wedding\nplanner at all. With AI and Pinterest, I\u2019m fairly certain I can begin to\nformulate an aesthetic I'm happy with.\n\nWhile AI\u2018s responses were less-than-ideal during the venue-search phase,\nclearly, design is where it\u2019s meant to shine.\n\n### What About Budget?\n\nHere\u2019s where we stand: I have zero idea of where we'll get married but am very\nsatisfied with floral arrangements (my fianc\u00e9 will be thrilled).\n\nSo, I decided to test out AI\u2018s advanced mathematical capabilities to help me\nbudget for a wedding. I\u2019m positive this is what the pioneers of machine\nlearning had in mind when they conceptualized the practical uses for AI down\nthe road.\n\nGranted, if you add up the high end of each percentage, you\u2018ll see it equates\nto 138% of my total budget (and I\u2019m no math wizard, but pretty sure we're\nlooking for 100% here), but overall, this is a reasonable place for me to\nstart whittling down my own budget based on preferences and priorities.\n\nAll in all, I'll give the credit to AI on this one.\n\nThere are hundreds of search results for \u201cappropriate wedding budget\u201d, so AI\nhelped me streamline that information into one place.\n\n### Would I recommend a wedding planner, or AI?\n\nUltimately, I would argue that AI is slightly better than starting with a\nGoogle search.\n\nWhen searching for venues, I was able to input plenty of personal requirements\nto get back relatively on-the-target results. With Google or wedding websites\nlike The Knot, I'm not able to get quite as specific.\n\nBut AI is ultimately just that: A starting point.\n\nFrom there, I still needed to peruse wedding websites to see photos of venues\nand read reviews. And, although AI was incredibly helpful with high-level\ndesign inspiration, it (again) can't really offer much in terms of real-life\nexamples, so from there, I turned to Pinterest.\n\nWhat I hope for more than anything is a version of AI that can match the\nexpertise and guidance of a full-time wedding planner: With advanced\ncapabilities to pull reviews, photos, and even costs for each venue; showcase\nsome personalized mood board designs; and offer advice and feedback.\n\nToo much to ask for from a robot? Probably. But a girl can dream.\n\nUntil then: Back to the Knot.\n\nTopics: Artificial Intelligence\n\n## Don't forget to share this post!\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * ### How Text-to-Video Apps May Impact the Entertainment & Stock Content Industries\n\nMar 19, 2024\n\n  * ### Nvidia: The Silent Force Powering AI Innovation\n\nMar 19, 2024\n\n  * ### How Artists Are Protecting Themselves in the AI Music Era\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\n  * ### Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas Talks Future of Information Seeking\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\n  * ### What does 'publicly available' training data mean to AI companies?\n\nApr 09, 2024\n\n  * ### Amazon Kills its AI-Powered 'Just Walk Out' Checkout Feature\n\nApr 09, 2024\n\n  * ### How Deepfakes Impact Influencer Marketing (and What to Do About It)\n\nApr 02, 2024\n\n  * ### Latimer is Making AI More Diverse and Inclusive\n\nMar 26, 2024\n\n  * ### Everything You Need to Know about AI-Powered Search Engine Perplexity\n\nMar 26, 2024\n\n  * ### Here's Everything You Need to Know about Deepfakes\n\nMar 19, 2024\n\n  * ### How Text-to-Video Apps May Impact the Entertainment & Stock Content Industries\n\nMar 19, 2024\n\n  * ### Nvidia: The Silent Force Powering AI Innovation\n\nMar 19, 2024\n\n  * ### How Artists Are Protecting Themselves in the AI Music Era\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\n  * ### Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas Talks Future of Information Seeking\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nWe're committed to your privacy.
