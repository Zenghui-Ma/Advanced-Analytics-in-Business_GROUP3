On Tuesday, state water officials took an unprecedented step to\nintervene in the destructive pumping of depleted groundwater in the state\u2019s\nsprawling agricultural heartland.\n\nThe decision puts a farming region known as the Tulare Lake groundwater\nsubbasin, which includes roughly 837 sq miles in the rural San Joaquin valley,\non \u201cprobation\u201d in accordance with a sustainable groundwater use law passed a\ndecade ago. Large water users will face fees and state oversight of their\npumping.\n\nCalifornia zombie lake turned farmland to water. A year later, is it gone for\ngood?\n\nRead more\n\nThe move, which water officials reassured farmers would be lifted if local\nagencies progress on developing stronger sustainability plans to mitigate\nissues, is the first of its kind \u2013 but has been years in the making. Over-\npumping of groundwater in this region has caused the land to collapse faster\nthan in almost any other area in the country, in some places sinking more than\na foot every year. Officials say the Tulare Lake groundwater subbasin failed\nfor years to provide adequate plans to mitigate their well-known water\nproblems.\n\nSuch plans are required under California\u2019s 2014 Sustainable Groundwater\nManagement Act (SGMA), a landmark law that required local agencies to come up\nwith their own long-term strategies to curb over-extraction and empowers the\nstate to supervise and enforce them. Probation is a compulsory step to set\nlagging local agencies back on track to achieve sustainability goals that must\nbe met by 2040.\n\nThe Tulare Lake subbasin is one of six the state has put up for possible\nprobation due to inadequate plans, all in the San Joaquin valley, the\npowerhouse of California\u2019s more than $50bn agricultural industry. The\ncrackdown here has been met with a strong backlash.\n\nThe decision followed a nine-hour hearing on Tuesday where farmers protested\nthe economic toll it would take on their industry. They cast the expected fees\non their pumping as a devastating blow to the work they do and their ability\nto do it in the future.\n\n\u201cWe all know there are several major farms that have filed bankruptcy in the\nlast several months \u2013 it\u2019s dire,\u201d Doug Freitas, a third-generation farmer with\n700 acres of land in the basin, said at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI believe\nthousands of family farms and people who depend on groundwater will be\ndisplaced and homeless if we don\u2019t take action on these excessive costs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the decision was urged by clean water and environmental advocates\nwho have called for more to be done to rein in dangerous overuse of\ngroundwater.\n\n\u201cI see where the sensitivity is, but they have to remind themselves \u2013 they are\nfarming on a lake that they pumped down,\u201d Fred Briones, a representative of\nthe Big Valley Pomo tribe said before the vote, referring to Tulare Lake, a\nvast freshwater lake that was drained to make room for agriculture. He added\nthat Indigenous people who once flourished on these lands no longer have water\nrights there. \u201cAs we watch the farmers fight amongst each other, the ground is\ncollapsing underneath their feet.\u201d\n\nTensions were on full display during the hearing as multigenerational farming\nfamilies, dairy owners and representatives of local water agencies spoke at\nlength, pushing the board to delay probation.\n\nOne local elected official, Doug Verboon, a Kings county supervisor, who urged\nthe state to act, said he\u2019d been threatened for his position. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult\nto stand up here, because I have people behind me that wish I would just shut\nthe hell up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe board, meanwhile, framed its position as softly as possible throughout the\nhearing, reminding triggered attendees that probation is temporary. But,\naccording to the law, if the groups across the San Joaquin valley don\u2019t make\nadequate progress within a year, further pumping restrictions could be put in\nplace.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you\nwhat\u2019s happening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor now, landowners will have to install and pay for meters that show how much\nthey\u2019re pumping, as well as fees for groundwater use. During probation,\npumpers will be charged a base fee of $300 for each well each year plus $20\nper acre-foot of water extracted; an acre-foot is a measurement used for large\namounts of water, equal to roughly the amount of water needed to cover an acre\nof land in a foot of water. These costs, all together, are expected to mount\nto millions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take this decision at all lightly,\u201d said Joaquin Esquivel, chair of\nthe state water resources control board, at the start of the hearing, adding\nthat associated fees inflicted on extractors are not to \u201cpunish the basins but\nto pay for the additional workload\u201d.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s hearing, farmers also spoke at length about how hard they have\nworked to curb groundwater overuse, and the difficult climate and economic\nconditions facing farmers across the country.\n\nGreg Gatzka, city manager of Corcoran, a city listed by the state as a\nseverely disadvantaged community, called on the board to consider the\nunintended consequences of the action, including the impact to urban residents\ndepending on a local economy held up by agriculture. \u201cWe are the most\nvulnerable city that can be impacted by this,\u201d he said, noting that things\nlike sales taxes from farm equipment could drop.\n\nDevon Matthis, a California assemblymember who represents the district\naffected by the probation, submitted a statement outlining the future\nimplications of the decisions. \u201cFood grows where water flows \u2013 my district\nfeeds the state,\u201d he said, adding that local water managers across the state\nwould be watching what happens. \u201cI ask that you remember who the stakeholders\nare and the negative effects the ag industry will suffer due to the state-\nmandated probation.\u201d\n\nThe fees, which were cut in half from the initial proposed amount, will begin\nin mid-July, along with requirements for landowners to record their\nextractions. Reports on progress will also be required annually from the\nsubbasin beginning in December.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * California\n  * Water\n  * Farming\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
