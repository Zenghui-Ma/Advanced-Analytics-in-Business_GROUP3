Moving to it has rarely been popular and\nis growing unfashionable; nowadays we demand that the information come to us.\nThis can be accomplished in three basic ways: moving physical media around,\nbroadcasting radiation through space, and sending signals through wires. This\narticle is about what will, for a short time anyway, be the biggest and best\nwire ever made.\n\nThis article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or\ncontain faulty links. Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue.\n\nWires warp cyberspace in the same way wormholes warp physical space: the two\npoints at opposite ends of a wire are, for informational purposes, the same\npoint, even if they are on opposite sides of the planet. The cyberspace-\nwarping power of wires, therefore, changes the geometry of the world of\ncommerce and politics and ideas that we live in. The financial districts of\nNew York, London, and Tokyo, linked by thousands of wires, are much closer to\neach other than, say, the Bronx is to Manhattan.\n\nToday this is all quite familiar, but in the 19th century, when the first\nfeeble bits struggled down the first undersea cable joining the Old World to\nthe New, it must have made people\u2019s hair stand up on end in more than just the\npurely electrical sense \u2013 it must have seemed supernatural. Perhaps this sort\nof feeling explains why when Samuel Morse stretched a wire between Washington\nand Baltimore in 1844, the first message he sent with his code was \u201cWhat hath\nGod wrought!\u201d \u2013 almost as if he needed to reassure himself and others that\nGod, and not the Devil, was behind it.\n\nDuring the decades after Morse\u2019s \u201cWhat hath God wrought!\u201d a plethora of\ndifferent codes, signalling techniques, and sending and receiving machines\nwere patented. A web of wires was spun across every modern city on the globe,\nand longer wires were strung between cities. Some of the early technologies\nwere, in retrospect, flaky: one early inventor wanted to use 26-wire cables,\none wire for each letter of the alphabet. But it quickly became evident that\nit was best to keep the number of individual wires as low as possible and find\nclever ways to fit more information onto them.\n\nThis requires more ingenuity than you might think \u2013 wires have never been\nperfectly transparent carriers of data; they have always degraded the\ninformation put into them. In general, this gets worse as the wire gets\nlonger, and so as the early telegraph networks spanned greater distances, the\npeople building them had to edge away from the seat-of-the-pants engineering\npractices that, applied in another field, gave us so many boiler explosions,\nand toward the more scientific approach that is the standard of practice\ntoday.\n\nStill, telegraphy, like many other forms of engineering, retained a certain\nbarnyard, improvised quality until the Year of Our Lord 1858, when the\nterrifyingly high financial stakes and shockingly formidable technical\nchallenges of the first transatlantic submarine cable brought certain long-\nsimmering conflicts to a rolling boil, incarnated the old and new approaches\nin the persons of Dr. Wildman Whitehouse and Professor William Thomson,\nrespectively, and brought the conflict between them into the highest possible\nrelief in the form of an inquiry and a scandal that rocked the Victorian\nworld. Thomson came out on top, with a new title and name \u2013 Lord Kelvin.\n\nEverything that has occurred in Silicon Valley in the last couple of decades\nalso occurred in the 1850s. Anyone who thinks that wild-ass high tech venture\ncapitalism is a late-20th-century California phenomenon needs to read about\nthe maniacs who built the first transatlantic cable projects (I recommend\nArthur C. Clarke\u2019s book How the World Was One). The only things that have\nchanged since then are that the stakes have gotten smaller, the process more\nbureaucratized, and the personalities less interesting.\n\nThose early cables were eventually made to work, albeit not without founding\nwhole new fields of scientific inquiry and generating many lucrative patents.\nUndersea cables, and long-distance communications in general, became the\nhighest of high tech, with many of the same connotations as rocket science or\nnuclear physics or brain surgery would acquire in later decades. Some\ncountries and companies (the distinction between countries and companies is\nhazy in the telco world) became very good at it, and some didn\u2019t. AT&T\nacquired a dominance of the field that largely continues to this day and is\nonly now being seriously challenged by a project called FLAG: the Fiberoptic\nLink Around the Globe.\n\nIn which the Hacker Tourist encounters: Penang, a microcosm of the Internet.\nRubber, Penang\u2019s chief commodity, and its many uses: protecting wires from the\nelements and concupiscent wanderers from harmful DNA. Advantages of chastity,\nboth for hacker tourists and for cable layers. Bizarre Spectaclesin the\njungles of southern Thailand. FLAG, its origins and its enemies.\n\n5\u00b0 241 24.932\u2032 N, 100\u00b0 241 19.748\u2032 E City of George Town, Island of Penang,\nMalaysia\n\nFLAG, a fiber-optic cable now being built from England to Japan, is a skinny\nlittle cuss (about an inch in diameter), but it is 28,000 kilometers long,\nwhich is long even compared to really big things like the planet Earth. When\nit is finished in September 1997, it arguably will be the longest engineering\nproject in history. Writing about it necessitates a lot of banging around\nthrough meatspace. Over the course of two months, photographer Alex Tehrani\nand I hit six countries and four continents trying to get a grip on this\nlongest, fastest, mother of all wires. I took a GPS receiver with me so that I\ncould have at least a general idea of where the hell we were. It gave me the\nabove reading in front of a Chinese temple around the corner from the Shangri-\nLa Hotel in Penang, Malaysia, which was only one of 100 peculiar spots around\nthe globe where I suddenly pulled up short and asked myself, \u201cWhat the hell am\nI doing here?\u201d\n\nYou might well ask yourself the same question before diving into an article as\nlong as this one. The answer is that we all depend heavily on wires, but we\nhardly ever think about them. Before learning about FLAG, I knew that data\npackets could get from America to Asia or the Middle East, but I had no idea\nhow. I knew that it had something to do with wires across the bottom of the\nocean, but I didn\u2019t know how many of those wires existed, how they got there,\nwho controlled them, or how many bits they could carry.\n\nAccording to legend, in 1876 the first sounds transmitted down a wire were\nAlexander Graham Bell saying \u201cMr. Watson, come here. I want you.\u201d Compared\nwith Morse\u2019s \u201cWhat hath God wrought!\u201d this is disappointingly banal \u2013 as if\nNeil Armstrong, setting foot on the moon, had uttered the words: \u201cBuzz, could\nyou toss me that rock hammer?\u201d It\u2019s as though during the 32 years following\nMorse\u2019s message, people had become inured to the amazing powers of wire.\n\nToday, another 120 years later, we take wires completely for granted. This is\nmost unwise. People who use the Internet (or for that matter, who make long-\ndistance phone calls) but who don\u2019t know about wires are just like the\nmillions of complacent motorists who pump gasoline into their cars without\never considering where it came from or how it found its way to the corner gas\nstation. That works only until the political situation in the Middle East gets\nall screwed up, or an oil tanker runs aground on a wildlife refuge. In the\nsame way, it behooves wired people to know a few things about wires \u2013 how they\nwork, where they lie, who owns them, and what sorts of business deals and\npolitical machinations bring them into being.\n\nIn the hopes of learning more about the modern business of really, really long\nwires, we spent much of the summer of 1996 in pursuits such as: being arrested\nby toothless, shotgun-toting Egyptian cops; getting pushed around by a drunken\nsmuggler queen on a Thai train; vaulting over rustic gates to take emergency\nshits in isolated fields; being kept awake by groovy Eurotrash backpackers\nsinging songs; blowing Saharan dust out of cameras; scraping equatorial mold\nout of fountain pens; stuffing faded banknotes into the palms of Egyptian\nservice-industry professionals; trying to persuade non-English-speaking taxi\ndrivers that we really did want to visit the beach even though it was pouring\nrain; and laundering clothes by showering in them. We still missed more than\nhalf the countries FLAG touches.\n\nOur method was not exactly journalism nor tourism in the normal sense but what\nmight be thought of as a new field of human endeavor called hacker tourism:\ntravel to exotic locations in search of sights and sensations that only would\nbe of interest to a geek.\n\nI will introduce sections with readings from my trusty GPS in case other\nhacker tourists would like to leap over the same rustic gates or get rained on\nat the same beaches\n\n5\u00b0 26.325\u2032 N, 100\u00b0 17.417\u2032 E Penang Botanical Gardens\n\nPenang, one of the first sites visited by this hacker tourist partly because\nof its little-known historical importance to wires, lies just off the west\ncoast of the Malay Peninsula. The British acquired it from the local sultan in\nthe late 1700s, built a pathetic fort above the harbor, and named it,\nappropriately, after the hapless General Cornwallis. They set up a couple of\nchurches and established the kernel of a judicial system. A vigorous market\ngrew up around them. A few kilometers away, they built a botanical garden.\n\nThis seems like an odd set of priorities to us today. But gardens were not\nmere decorations to the British \u2013 they were strategic installations.\n\nThe headquarters was Kew Gardens outside of London. Penang was one of the\nforward outposts, and it became incomparably more important than the nearby\nfort. In 1876, 70,000 seeds of the rubber tree, painstakingly collected by\nbotanists in the Amazon rain forest, were brought to Kew Gardens and planted\nin a greenhouse. About 2,800 of them germinated and were shipped to the\nbotanical gardens in Sri Lanka and Penang, where they propagated explosively\nand were used to establish rubber plantations.\n\nMost of these plantations were on the neighboring Malay Peninsula, a lumpy,\nbony tentacle of land that stretches for 1,000 miles from Bangkok in the north\nto Singapore in the south, where it grazes the equator. The landscape is a\nstalemate between, on one hand, the devastatingly powerful erosive forces of\ncontinual tropical rainstorms and dense plant life, and, on the other hand,\nsome really, really hard rocks. Anything with the least propensity to be\neroded did so a long time ago and turned into a paddy. What\u2019s left are ridges\nof stone that rise almost vertically from the landscape and are still mostly\ncovered with rain forest, notwithstanding efforts by the locals to cut it all\ndown. The flat stuff is all used for something \u2013 coconuts, date palms, banana\ntrees, and above all, rubber.\n\nUntil artificial rubber was invented by the colony-impaired Germans, no modern\neconomy could exist without the natural stuff. All of the important powers had\ntropical colonies where rubber was produced. For the Netherlands, it was\nIndonesia; for France, it was Indochina; for the British, it was what they\nthen called Malaya, as well as many other places.\n\nWithout rubber and another kind of tree resin called gutta-percha, it would\nnot have been possible to wire the world. Early telegraph lines were just\nnaked conductors strung from pole to pole, but this worked poorly, especially\nin wet conditions, so some kind of flexible but durable insulation was needed.\nAfter much trial and error, rubber became the standard for terrestrial and\naerial wires while gutta-percha (a natural gum also derived from a tree grown\nin Malaya) was used for submarine cables. Gutta-percha is humble-looking\nstuff, a nondescript brown crud that surrounds the inner core of old submarine\ncables to a thickness of perhaps 1 centimeter, but it was a wonder material\nback in those days, and the longer it remained immersed in salt water, the\nbetter it got.\n\nSo far, it was all according to the general plan that the British had in mind:\nfind some useful DNA in the Americas, stockpile it at Kew Gardens, propagate\nit to other botanical gardens around the world, make money off the proceeds,\nand grow the economy. Modern-day Penang, however, is a good example of the\nnotion of unintended consequences.\n\nAs soon as the British had established the rule of law in Penang, various\nkinds of Chinese people began to move in and establish businesses. Most of\nthem were Hokkien Chinese from north of Hong Kong, though Cantonese, Hakka,\nand other groups also settled there. Likewise, Tamils and Sikhs came from\nacross the Bay of Bengal. As rubber trees began to take over the countryside,\na common arrangement was for Chinese immigrants to establish rubber\nplantations and hire Indian immigrants (as well as Malays) as laborers.\n\nThe British involvement, then, was more catalytic than anything else. They\ndidn\u2019t own the rubber plantations. They merely bought the rubber on an open\nmarket from Chinese brokers who in turn bought it from producers of various\nethnicities. The market was just a few square blocks of George Town where\nBritish law was enforced, i.e. where businessmen could rely on a few basics\nlike property rights, contracts, and a currency.\n\nDuring and after World War II, the British lost what presence they had here.\nPenang fell to the Japanese and became a base for German U-Boats patrolling\nthe Indian Ocean. Later, there was a somewhat messy transition to independence\ninvolving a communist insurrection and a war with Indonesia. Today, Malaysia\nis one of Asia\u2019s economic supernovas and evidently has decided that it will be\nsecond to none when it comes to the Internet. They are furiously wiring up the\nplace and have established JARING, which is the Malaysian Internet (this word\nis a somewhat tortured English acronym that happens to spell out the Malay\nword for the Net).\n\nIf you have a look at JARING\u2019s homepage (www.jaring.my/jaring), you will be\nconfronted by a link that will take you to a page reciting Malaysia\u2019s\ncensorship laws, which, like most censorship laws, are ridiculously vague and\nhence sort of creepy and yet, in the context of the Internet, totally\nunworkable.\n\nIn a way, the architects of JARING are trying to run the Kew Gardens\nexperiment all over again. By adopting the Internet protocol for their\nnational information infrastructure, they have copied the same DNA that,\nplanted in the deregulated telecom environment of the United States, has grown\nlike some unstoppable exotic weed. Now they are trying to raise the same plant\ninside a hothouse (because they want it to flourish) but in a pot (because\nthey don\u2019t want it to escape into the wild).\n\nThey seem to have misunderstood both their own history and that of the\nInternet, which run strangely parallel. Today the streets of George Town,\nPenang\u2019s main city, are so vivid, crowded, and intensely multicultural that by\ncomparison they make New York City look like Colonial Williamsburg. Every\nblock has a mosque or Hindu temple or Buddhist shrine or Christian church. You\ncan get any kind of food, hear any language. The place is thronged, but it\u2019s\naffluent, and it works. It\u2019s a lot like the Internet.\n\nBoth Penang and the Internet were established basically for strategic military\nreasons. In both cases, what was built by the military was merely a kernel for\na much vaster phenomenon that came along later. This kernel was really nothing\nmore than a protocol, a set of rules. If you wanted to follow those rules, you\ncould participate, otherwise you were free to go elsewhere. Because the\nprotocol laid down a standard way for people to interact, which was clearly\nset out and could be understood by anyone, it attracted smart, adaptable,\nambitious people from all over the place, and at a certain point it flew\ncompletely out of control and turned into something that no one had ever\nenvisioned: something thriving, colorful, wildly diverse, essentially\npeaceful, and plagued only by the congestion of its own success.\n\nJARING\u2019s link to the global Internet is over an undersea cable that connects\nit to the United States. This is typical of many Southeast Asian countries,\nwhich are far better connected to the US than they are to one another. But in\nlate June of 1996, a barge called the Elbe appeared off the coast of Penang.\nDivers and boats came ashore, braving an infestation of sea snakes, and\nfloated in a segment of armored cable that will become Malaysia\u2019s link to\nFLAG. The capacity of that cable is theoretically some 5.3 Gbps. Much of this\nwill be used for telephone and other non-Internet purposes, but it can\u2019t help\nbut serve as a major floodgate between JARING, the censored pseudo-Internet of\nMalaysia, and the rest of the Net. After that, it will be interesting to see\nhow long JARING remains confined to its pot.\n\nFLAG facts\n\nThe FLAG system, that mother of all wires, starts at Porthcurno, England, and\nproceeds to Estepona, Spain; through the Strait of Gibraltar to Palermo,\nSicily; across the Mediterranean to Alexandria and Port Said, Egypt; overland\nfrom those two cities to Suez, Egypt; down the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea,\nwith a potential branching unit to Jedda, Saudia Arabia; around the Arabian\nPeninsula to Dubai, site of the FLAG Network Operations Center; across the\nIndian Ocean to Bombay; around the tip of India and across the Bay of Bengal\nand the Andaman Sea to Ban Pak Bara, Thailand, with a branch down to Penang,\nMalaysia; overland across Thailand to Songkhla; up through the South China Sea\nto Lan Tao Island in Hong Kong; up the coast of China to a branch in the East\nChina Sea where one fork goes to Shanghai and the other to Koje-do Island in\nKorea, and finally to two separate landings in Japan \u2013 Ninomiya and Miura,\nwhich are owned by rival carriers.\n\nPhone company people tend to think (and do business) in terms of circuits.\nHacker tourists, by contrast, tend to think in terms of bits per second.\nConverting between these two units of measurements is simple: on any modern\nphone system, the conversations are transmitted digitally, and the standard\nbit rate that is used for this purpose is 64 kbps. A circuit, then, in\ntelephony jargon, amounts to a datastream of 64 kbps.\n\nCopper submarine cables of only a few decades ago could carry only a few dozen\ncircuits \u2013 say, about 2,500 kbps total. The first generation of optical-fiber\ncables, by contrast, carries more than 1,000 times as much data \u2013 280 Mbps of\ndata per fiber pair. (Fibers always come in pairs. This practice seems obvious\nto a telephony person, who is in the business of setting up symmetrical two-\nway circuits, but makes no particular sense to a hacker tourist who tends to\nthink in terms of one-way packet transmission. The split between these two\nways of thinking runs very deep and accounts for much tumult in the telecom\nworld, as will be explained later.) The second generation of optical-fiber\ncables carries 560 Mbps per fiber pair. FLAG and other third-generation\nsystems will carry 5.3 Gbps per pair. Or, in the system of units typically\nused by phone company people, they will carry 60,000 circuits on each fiber\npair.\n\nIf you multiply 60,000 circuits times 64 kbps per circuit, you get a bit rate\nof only 3.84 Gbps, which leaves 1.46 Gbps unaccounted for. This bandwidth is\ndevoted to various kinds of overhead, such as frame headers and error\ncorrection. The FLAG cable contains two sets of fiber pairs, and so its\ntheoretical maximum capacity is 120,000 circuits, or (not counting the\noverhead) just under 8 Gbps of actual throughput.\n\nThese numbers really knock \u2019em dead in the phone industry. To the hacker\ntourist, or anyone who spends much time messing around with computer networks,\nthey seem distinctly underwhelming. All this trouble and expense for a measly\n8 Gbps? You\u2019ve got to be kidding! Again, it comes down to a radical difference\nin perspective between telephony people and internet people.\n\nIn defense of telephony people, it must be pointed out that they are the ones\nwho really know the score when it comes to sending bits across oceans.\nNetheads have heard so much puffery about the robust nature of the Internet\nand its amazing ability to route around obstacles that they frequently have a\ngrossly inflated conception of how many routes packets can take between\ncontinents and how much bandwidth those routes can carry. As of this writing,\nI have learned that nearly the entire state of Minnesota was recently cut off\nfrom the Internet for 13 hours because it had only one primary connection to\nthe global Net, and that link went down. If Minnesota, of all places, is so\nvulnerable, one can imagine how tenuous many international links must be.\n\nDouglas Barnes, an Oakland-based hacker and cypherpunk, looked into this issue\na couple of years ago when, inspired by Bruce Sterling\u2019s Islands in the Net,\nhe was doing background research on a project to set up a data haven in the\nCaribbean. \u201cI found out that the idea of the Internet as a highly distributed,\nredundant global communications system is a myth,\u201d he discovered. \u201cVirtually\nall communications between countries take place through a very small number of\nbottlenecks, and the available bandwidth simply isn\u2019t that great.\u201d And he\ncautions: \u201cEven outfits like FLAG don\u2019t really grok the Internet. The\nundersized cables they are running reflect their myopic outlook.\u201d\n\nSo the bad news is that the capacity of modern undersea cables like FLAG isn\u2019t\nvery impressive by Internet standards, but the slightly better news is that\nsuch cables are much better than what we have now.Here\u2019s how they work:\nSignals are transmitted down the fiber as modulated laser light with a\nwavelength of 1,558 nanometers (nm), which is in the infrared range. These\nsignals begin to fade after they have traveled a certain distance, so it\u2019s\nnecessary to build amplifiers into the cable every so often. In the case of\nFLAG, the spacing of these amplifiers ranges from 45 to 85 kilometers. They\nwork on a strikingly simple and elegant principle. Each amplifier contains an\napproximately 10-meter-long piece of special fiber that has been doped with\nerbium ions, making it capable of functioning as a laser medium. A separate\nsemiconductor laser built into the amplifier generates powerful light at 1,480\nnm \u2013 close to the same frequency as the signal beam, but not close enough to\ninterfere with it. This light, directed into the doped fiber, pumps the\nelectrons orbiting around those erbium ions up to a higher energy level.\n\nThe signal coming down the FLAG cable passes through the doped fiber and\ncauses it to lase, i.e., the excited electrons drop back down to a lower\nenergy level, emitting light that is coherent with the incoming signal \u2013 which\nis to say that it is an exact copy of the incoming signal, except more\npowerful.\n\nThe amplifiers need power \u2013 up to 10,000 volts DC, at 0.9 amperes. Since\npublic 10,000-volt outlets are few and far between on the bottom of the ocean,\nthis power must be delivered down the same cable that carries the fibers. The\ncable, therefore, consists of an inner core of four optical fibers, coated\nwith plastic jackets of different colors so that the people at opposite ends\ncan tell which is which, plus a thin copper wire that is used for test\npurposes. The total thickness of these elements taken together is comparable\nto a pencil lead; they are contained within a transparent plastic tube.\nSurrounding this tube is a sheath consisting of three steel segments designed\nso that they interlock and form a circular jacket. Around that is a layer of\nabout 20 steel \u201cstrength wires\u201d \u2013 each perhaps 2 mm in diameter \u2013 that wrap\naround the core in a steep helix. Around the strength wires goes a copper tube\nthat serves as the conductor for the 10,000-volt power feed. Only one\nconductor is needed because the ocean serves as the ground wire. This tube\nalso is watertight and so performs the additional function of protecting the\ncable\u2019s innards. It then is surrounded by polyethylene insulation to a total\nthickness of about an inch. To protect it from the rigors of shipment and\nlaying, the entire cable is clothed in good old-fashioned tarred jute,\nalthough jute nowadays is made from plastic, not hemp.\n\nThis suffices for the deep-sea portions of the cable. In shallower waters,\nadditional layers of protection are laid on, beginning with a steel antishark\njacket. As the shore is approached, various other layers of steel armoring\nwires are added.\n\nThis more or less describes how all submarine cables are being made as of\n1996. Only a few companies in the world know how to make cables like this:\nAT&T Submarine Systems International (AT&T-SSI) in the US, Alcatel in France,\nand KDD Submarine Cable Systems (KDD-SCS) in Japan, among others. AT&T-SSI and\nKDD-SCS frequently work together on large projects and are responsible for\nFLAG. Alcatel, in classic French fasion, likes to go it alone.\n\nThis basic technology will, by the end of the century, be carrying most of the\ninformation between continents. Copper-based coaxial cable systems are still\nin operation in many places around the world, but all of them will have\nreached the end of their practical lifetimes within a few years. Even if they\nstill function, they are not worth the trouble it takes to operate them. TPC-1\n(Trans Pacific Cable #1), which connected Japan to Guam and hence to the\nUnited States in 1964, is still in perfect working order, but so commercially\nworthless that it has been turned over to a team at Tokyo University, which is\nusing it to carry out seismic research. The capacity of such cables is so tiny\nthat modern fiber cables could absorb all of their traffic with barely a\nhiccup if the right switches and routers were in place. Likewise, satellites\nhave failed to match some of the latest leaps in fiber capacity and can no\nlonger compete with submarine cables, at least until such time as low-flying\nconstellations such as Iridium and Teledesic begin operating.\n\nWithin the next few years, several huge third-generational optical fiber\nsystems will be coming online: not only FLAG but a FLAG competitor called SEA-\nME-WE 3 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe #3); TPC-5 (Trans-Pacific\nCable #5); APCN (Asia-Pacific Cable Network), which is a web of cables\ninterconnecting Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand,\nIndonesia, Singapore, Australia, and the Philippines; and the latest TAT\n(Transatlantic) cable. So FLAG is part of a trend that will soon bring about a\nvast increase in intercontinental bandwidth.\n\nWhat is unusual about FLAG is not its length (although it will be the longest\ncable ever constructed) or its technology (which is shared by other cables)\nbut how it came into existence. But that\u2019s a business question which will be\ndealt with later. First, the hacker tourist is going to travel a short\ndistance up the Malay Peninsula to southern Thailand, one of the two places\nwhere FLAG passes overland. On a world map this looks about as difficult as\nthrowing an extension cord over a sandbar, but when you actually get there, it\nturns out to be a colossal project\n\n7\u00b0 3.467\u2032 N,100\u00b0 22.489\u2032 EFLAG manhole production site, southern Thailand\n\nLarge portions of this section were written in a hotel in Ban Hat Yai,\nThailand, which is one of the information-transfer capitals of the planet\nregardless of whether you think of information transfer as bits propagating\ndown an optical fiber, profound and complex religious faiths being transmitted\ndown through countless generations, or genetic material being interchanged\nbetween consenting adults. Male travelers approaching Ban Hat Yai will have a\ndifficult time convincing travel agents, railway conductors, and taxi drivers\nthat they are coming only to look at a big fat wire, but the hacker tourist\nmust get used to being misunderstood.\n\nWe stayed in a hotel with all the glossy accoutrements of an Asian business\ncenter plus a few perks such as partially used jumbo condom packages\nsquirreled away on closet shelves, disconcertingly huge love marks on the\nsofas, and extraordinarily long, fine, black hairs all over the bathroom.\nWhile writing, I sat before a picture window looking out over a fine view of:\na well-maintained but completely empty swimming pool, a green Carlsberg Beer\nbillboard written in Thai script, an industrial-scale whorehouse catering to\nJapanese \u201cbusinessmen,\u201d a rather fine Buddhist temple complex, and, behind\nthat, a district of brand-new high-rise hotels built to cater to the\nburgeoning information-transfer industry, almost none of which has anything to\ndo with bits and bytes. Tropical storms rolled through, lightning flashed, I\nsucked down European beers from the minibar and tried to cope with a bad case\nof information overload. FLAG is a huge project, bigger and more complicated\nthan many wars, and to visit even chunks of this cable operation is to be\nfloored by it.\n\nWe first met Jim Daily and Alan Wall underneath that big Carlsberg sign,\nsitting out in a late-afternoon rainstorm under an umbrella, having a couple\nof beers \u2013 \u201cthe only ferangs here,\u201d as Wall told me on the phone, using the\nlocal term for foreign devil. Daily is American, 2 meters tall, blond, blue-\neyed, khaki-and-polo-shirted, gregarious, absolutely plain-spoken, and almost\nalways seems to be having a great time. Wall is English, shorter, dark-haired,\nimpeccably suited, cagey, reticent, and dry. Both are in their 50s. It is of\nsome significance to this story that, at the end of the day, these two men\nunwind by sitting out in the rain and hoisting a beer, paying no attention\nwhatsoever to the industrial-scale whorehouse next door. Both of them have\nseen many young Western men arrive here on business missions and completely\nlose control of their sphincters and become impediments to any kind of\norganized activity. Daily hired Wall because, like Daily, he is a stable\nfamily man who has his act together. They are the very definition of a\ncomplementary relationship, and they seem to be making excellent progress\ntoward their goal, which is to run two really expensive wires across the Malay\nPeninsula.\n\nSince these two, and many of the others we will meet on this journey, have\nmuch in common with one another, this is as good a place as any to write a\ngeneral description. They tend to come from the US or the British Commonwealth\ncountries but spend very little time living there. They are cheerful and\noutgoing, rudely humorous, and frequently have long-term marriages to\nadaptable wives. They tend to be absolutely straight shooters even when they\nare talking to a hacker tourist about whom they know nothing. Their openness\nwould probably be career suicide in the atmosphere of Byzantine court-eunuch\nintrigue that is public life in the United States today. On the other hand, if\nI had an unlimited amount of money and woke up tomorrow morning with a burning\ndesire to see a 2,000-hole golf course erected on the surface of Mars, I would\nprobably call men like Daily and Wall, do a handshake deal with them, send\nthem a blank check, and not worry about it.\n\nDaily works out of Bangkok, the place where banks are headquartered, contracts\nare written, and 50-ton cranes are to be had. Alan \u201cthe ferang\u201d Wall lives in\nBan Hat Yai, the center of the FLAG operation in Thailand, cruising the cable\nroutes a couple of times a week, materializing unpredictably in the heart of\nthe tropical jungle in a perfectly tailored dark suit to inspect, among other\nthings, FLAG\u2019s chain of manhole-making villages.\n\nThere were seven of these in existence during the summer of 1996, all lying\nalong one of the two highways that run across the isthmus between the Andaman\nand the South China Seas. These highways, incidentally, are lined with utility\npoles carrying both power and communications wires. The tops of the poles are\nguarded by conical baskets about halfway up. The baskets prevent rats from\nscampering up the poles to chew away the tasty insulation on the wires and\npoisonous snakes from slithering up to sun themselves on the crossbars, a\npractice that has been known to cause morale problems among line workers.\n\nThe manhole-making village we are visiting on this fine, steamy summer day has\na population of some 130 workers plus an unknown number of children. The\nvillage was founded in the shade of an old, mature rubber plantation. Along\nthe highway are piles of construction materials deposited by trucks: bundles\nof half-inch rebar, piles of sand and gravel. At one end of the clearing is a\ndouble row of shelters made from shiny new corrugated metal nailed over wooden\nframes, where the men, women, and children of the village live. On the end of\nthis is an open-air office under a lean-to roof, equipped with a whiteboard \u2013\njust like any self-respecting high tech company. Chickens strut around\nflapping their wings uselessly, looking for stuff to peck out of the ground.\n\nWhen the day begins, the children are bused off to school, and the men and\nwomen go to work. The women cut the rebar to length using an electric chop\nsaw. The bars are laid out on planks with rows of nails sticking out of them\nto form simple templates. Then the pieces of rebar are wired together to\ncreate cages perhaps 2 meters high and 1.5 meters on a side. Then the\ncarpenters go to work, lining the cage inside and out with wooden planks.\nFinally, 13 metric tons of cement are poured into the forms created by the\nplanks. When the planks are taken away, the result is a hollow, concrete\nobelisk with a cylindrical collar projecting from the top, with an iron\nmanhole cover set into it. Making a manhole takes three weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, along the highway, trenches are being dug \u2013 quickly scooped out of\nthe lowland soil with a backhoe, or, in the mountains, laboriously\njackhammered into solid rock. A 50-ton crane comes to the village, picks up\none manhole at a time using lifting loops that the villagers built into its\ntop, and sets it on a flatbed truck that transports it to one of the wider\nexcavations that are spaced along the trench at intervals of 300 to 700\nmeters. The manholes will allow workers to climb down to the level of the\nburied cable, which will stretch through a conduit running under the ground\nbetween the manholes.\n\nThe crane lowers the manhole into the excavation. A couple of hard-hatted\nworkers get down there with it and push it this way and that, getting it lined\nup, while other workers up on the edge of the pit help out by shoving on it\nwith a big stick. Finally it settles gingerly into place, atop its prepoured\npad. The foreman clambers in, takes a transparent green disposable lighter\nfrom his pocket, and sets it down sideways on the top of the manhole. The\nliquid butane inside the lighter serves as a fluid level, verifying that the\nmanhole is correctly positioned.\n\nWith a few more hours\u2019 work, the conduits have been mated with the tubes built\ninto the walls of the manhole and the surrounding excavation filled in so that\nnothing is left except some disturbed earth and a manhole cover labeled CAT:\nCommunications Authority of Thailand. The eventual result of all this work\nwill be two separate chains of manholes (931 of them all told) running\nparallel to two different highways, each chain joined by twin lengths of\nconduit \u2013 one conduit for FLAG and one for CAT.\n\nFarther west, another crew is at work, burdened with three enormous metal\nspools carrying flexible black plastic conduit having an inside diameter of an\ninch. The three spools are set up on stands near a manhole, the three ducts\nbrought together and tied into a neat bundle by workers using colorful plastic\ntwine. Meanwhile, others down in the manhole are wrestling with the world\u2019s\nmost powerful peashooter: a massive metal pipe with a screw jack on its butt\nend. The muzzle of the device is inserted into one of the conduits on the\nmanhole wall and the screw jack is tightened against the opposite wall to hold\nit horizontal. Next the peashooter is loaded: a big round sponge with a rope\ntied to it is inserted into an opening on its side. The rope comes off a long\nspool. Finally, a hefty air compressor is fired up above ground and its outlet\ntube thrown down into the manhole and patched into a valve on this pipe. When\nthe valve is opened, compressed air floods the pipe behind the round sponge,\nwhich shoots forward like a bullet in a gun barrel, pulling the rope behind it\nand causing the reel to spin wildly like deep-sea fishing tackle that has\nhooked a big tuna.\n\n\u201cNext manhole! Next manhole!\u201d cries the foreman excitedly, and pedestrians,\nbicyclists, motor scooters, and (if inspectors or hacker tourists are present)\ncars parade down the highway, veering around water buffaloes and goats and\nchickens to the next manhole, some half a kilometer away, where a torrent of\nwater, driven before the sponge, is blasting out of a conduit and slamming\ninto the opposite wall. One length of the conduit can hold some 5 cubic meters\nof water, and the sponge, ramming down the tube like a piston, forces all of\nit out. Finally the sponge pops out of the hole like a pea from a peashooter,\nbringing the rope with it. The rope is used to pull through a thicker rope,\nwhich is finally connected to the triple bundle of thin duct at one end and to\na pulling motor at the other. This pulling motor is a slowly turning drum with\nseveral turns of rope around it.\n\nNow the work gets harder: at the manhole with the reels, some workers bundle\nand tie the ducts as they unroll while others, down in the hole, bend them\naround a difficult curve and keep them feeding smoothly into the conduit. At\nthe other end, a man works with the puller, keeping the tension constant and\nremaining alert for trouble. Back at the reels, the thin duct occasionally\ngets wedged between loose turns on the reel, and everything has to be stopped.\nUsually this is communicated to the puller via walkie-talkie, but when the\nafternoon rains hit, the walkie-talkies don\u2019t work as well, and a messenger\nhas to buzz back and forth on a motor scooter. But eventually the triple inner\nduct is pulled through both of the conduits, and the whole process can begin\nagain on the next segment.\n\nDaily and Wall preside over this operation, which is Western at the top and\npure Thai at the ground level, with a gradual shading of cultures in between.\nFLAG has dealings in many countries, and the arrangement is different in each\none. Here, the top level is a 50-50 partnership between FLAG and Thailand\u2019s\nCAT. They bid the project out to two different large contractors, each of whom\nhired subcontractors with particular specialties who work through sub-sub-\ncontractors who hire the workers, get them to the site, and make things\nhappen. The incentives are shaped at each level so that the contractors will\nget the job done without having to be micromanaged, and the roads seem to be\ncrawling with inspectors representing various levels of the project who make\nsure that the work is being done according to spec (at the height of this\noperation, 50 percent of the traffic on some of these roads was FLAG-related).\n\nThe top-level contracts are completely formalized with detailed\nspecifications, bid bonds, and so on, and business at this level is done in\nEnglish and in air-conditioned offices. But by the time you get to the bottom\nlayer, work is being done by people who, although presumably just as\nintelligent as the big shots, are fluent only in Thai and not especially\nliterate in any language, running around in rubber flip-flops, doing business\non a handshake, pulling wads of bills out of their pockets when necessary to\npay for some supplies or get drinks brought in. Consequently, the way in which\nthe work is performed bears no resemblance whatsoever to the way it would be\ndone in the United States or any other developed country. It is done the Thai\nway.\n\nNot one but two entirely separate pairs of conduits are being created in this\nfashion. Both of them run from the idyllic sandy beach of Ban Pak Bara on the\nwest to the paradisiacal sandy beach of Songkhla on the east \u2013 both of them\nare constructed in the same way, to the same specifications. Both of them run\nalong highways. The southern route takes the obvious path, paralleling a road\nthat runs in a relatively straight line between the two endpoints for 170\nkilometers. But the other route jogs sharply northward just out of Ban Pak\nBara, runs up the coast for some distance, turns east, and climbs up over the\nbony spine of the peninsula, then turns south again and finally reaches\nSongkhla after meandering for some 270 kilometers. Unlike the southern route,\nwhich passes almost exclusively over table-flat paddy land, easily excavated\nwith a backhoe, the northern route goes for many kilometers over solid rock,\nwhich must be trenched with jackhammers and other heavy artillery, filled with\ngalvanized steel conduit, and then backfilled with gravel and concrete.\n\nThis raises questions. The questions turn out to have interesting answers.\nI\u2019ll summarize them first and then go into detail. Q: Why bother running two\nwidely separated routes over theMalay Peninsula?\n\nA: Because Thailand, like everywhere else in the world, is full ofidiots with\nbackhoes.\n\nQ: Isn\u2019t that a pain in the ass?\n\nA: You have no idea.\n\nQ: Why not just go south around Singapore and keep the cable in the water,\nthen?\n\nA: Because Singapore is controlled by the enemy.\n\nQ: Who is the enemy?\n\nA: FLAG\u2019s enemies are legion.\n\nThe reason for the difficult northern route is FLAG\u2019s pursuit of diversity,\nwhich in this case is not a politically correct buzzword (though FLAG also has\nplenty of that kind of diversity) but refers to the principle that one should\nhave multiple, redundant paths to make the system more robust. Diversity is\nnot needed in the deep ocean, but land crossings are viewed as considerably\nmore risky. So FLAG decided, early on, to lay two independent cables on two\ndifferent routes, instead of one.\n\nThe indefatigable Jim Daily, along with his redoubtable inspector Ruzee, drove\nus along every kilometer of both of these routes over the course of a day and\na half. \u201cLet me ask you a na\u00efve question,\u201d I said to him, once I got a load of\nthe big rock ridge he was getting ready to cut a trench through. \u201cWhy not just\nput one cable on one side of that southern highway and another cable on the\nopposite side?\u201d I found it hard to imagine a backhoe cutting through both\nsides of the highway at once.\u201d\n\nThey just wanted to be sure that there was no conceivable disaster that could\nwipe out both routes at the same time,\u201d he shrugged.\n\nFLAG has envisioned every possible paranoid disaster scenario that could lead\nto a failure of a cable segment and has laid action plans that will be\nimplemented if this should happen. For example, it has made deals with its\ncompetitors so that it can buy capacity from them, if it has to, while it\nrepairs a break (likewise, the competitors might reserve capacity from FLAG\nfor the same reason). Despite all this, FLAG is saying in this case: \u201cWe are\ngoing to cut a trench across a 50-mile-wide piece of rock because we think it\nwill make our cable infinitesimally more reliable.\u201d Essentially, they have to\ndo it, because otherwise no one will entrust valuable bits to their cable\nsystem.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they keep it in the water? Opinions vary on this: pro-FLAG people\nargue that the Straits, with all of their ship traffic, are a relatively\nhazardous place to put a submarine cable and that a terrestrial crossing of\nthe Malay Peninsula is a tactical masterstroke. FLAG skeptics will tell you\nthat the terrestrial crossing is a necessity imposed on them because Singapore\nTelecom made the decision that they didn\u2019t want to be connected to FLAG.\n\nInstead, Singapore Telecom and France Telecom have been promoting SEA-ME-WE 3,\nthat Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 3 cable, a system whose target\ndate is 1999, two years later than FLAG. SEA-ME-WE 1 and 2 run from France to\nSingapore and 3 was originally planned to cover the same territory, but now\nits organizers have gotten other telecoms, such as British Telecom, involved.\nThey hope that SEA-ME-WE 3 will continue north from Singapore as far as Japan,\nand north from France to Great Britain, covering generally the same route as\nFLAG. FLAG and SEA-ME-WE 3 are, therefore, direct competitors.\n\nThe competition is not just between two different wires. It is a competition\nbetween two entirely different systems of doing business, two entirely\ndifferent visions of how the telecommunications industry should work. It is a\ncompetition, also, between AT&T (the juggernaut of the field, and the power\nbehind most telecom-backed systems) and Nynex (the Baby Bell with an Oedipus\ncomplex and the power behind FLAG). Nynex and AT&T have their offices a short\ndistance from each other in Manhattan, but the war between them is being\nfought in trenches in Thailand, glass office towers in Tokyo, and dusty\ngovernment ministries in Egypt.\n\nThe origin of FLAG\n\nKessler Marketing Intelligence Corp. (KMI) is a Newport, Rhode Island, company\nthat has developed a specialty in tracking the worldwide submarine cable\nsystem. This is not a trivial job, since there are at least 320 cable systems\nin operation around the world, with old ones being retired and new ones being\nlaid all the time. KMI makes money from this by selling a document titled\n\u201cWorldwide Summary of Fiberoptic Submarine Systems\u201d that will set you back\nabout US$4,500 but that is a must-read for anyone wanting to operate in that\nbusiness. Compiling and maintaining this document gives a rare Olympian\nperspective on the world communications system.\n\nIn the late 1980s, as KMI looked at the cables then in existence and the\nsystems that were slated for the next few years, they noticed an almost\nmonstrous imbalance.\n\nThe United States would, by the late 1990s, be massively connected to Europe\nby some 200,000 circuits across the Atlantic, and just as massively connected\nto Asia by a roughly equal number of circuits across the Pacific. But between\nEurope and Asia there would be fewer than 20,000 circuits.\n\nCables have always been financed and built by telecoms, which until very\nrecently have always been government-backed monopolies. In the business, these\nare variously referred to as PTTs (Post, Telephone, and Telegraphs) or PTAs\n(Post and Telecom Authorities) or simply as \u201cthe clubs.\u201d The dominant club has\nlong been AT&T \u2013 especially in the years since World War II, when most of the\ninternational telecommunications system was built.\n\nTraditionally, the way a cable system gets built is that AT&T meets with other\nPTTs along the proposed route to negotiate terms (although in the opinion of\nsome informed people who don\u2019t work for AT&T, \u201cdictate\u201d comes closer to the\ntruth than \u201cnegotiate\u201d). The capital needed to construct the cable system is\nponied up by the various PTTs along its route, which, consequently, end up\ncollectively owning the cable and all of its capacity. This is a tidy enough\narrangement as those telecoms traditionally \u201cown\u201d all of the customers within\ntheir borders and can charge them whatever it takes to pay for all of those\ncables. Cables built this way are now called \u201cclub cables.\u201d\n\nGiven America\u2019s postwar dominance of the world economy and AT&T\u2019s dominance of\nthe communications system, it becomes much easier to understand the huge\nbandwidth imbalance that the analysts at KMI noticed. Actually, it would be\nsurprising if this imbalance didn\u2019t exist. If the cable industry worked on\nanything like a free-market basis, this howling chasm in bandwidth between\nEurope and Asia would be an obvious opportunity for entrepreneurs. Since the\nsystem was, in fact, controlled by government monopolies, and since the\nbiggest of those monopolies had no particular interest in building a cable\nthat entirely bypassed its territory, nothing was likely to happen.\n\nBut then something did happen. KMI, whose entire business is founded on\nknowing and understanding the market, was ideally positioned, not just to be\naware of this situation, but also to crunch the numbers and figure out whether\nit constituted a workable business opportunity. In 1989, it published a study\non worldwide undersea fiber-optic systems that included some such\ncalculations. Based on reasonable assumptions about the cost of the system,\nits working lifetime, and the present cost of communications on similar\nsystems, KMI reckoned that if a state-of-the-art cable were laid from the\nUnited Kingdom to the Middle East it would pay back its investors in two to\nfive years. Setting aside for a moment the fact that it went against all the\ntraditions of the industry, there was no reason in principle why a privately\nfinanced cable could not be constructed to fill this demand. Investors would\npool the capital, just as they would for any other kind of business venture.\nThey would buy the cable, pay to have it installed, sell the capacity to local\ncustomers, and make money for their shareholders.\n\nThe study was read by Gulf Associates, a group of New York-based moneyed\nIranian expats who are always looking for good investments. Gulf Associates\nchecked out KMI\u2019s prefeasibility study to get an idea of what the parameters\nof such a system would be. Based on that, other companies, such as Dallah Al-\nBaraka (a Saudi investment company), Marubeni Corp. (a Tokyo trading company),\nand Nynex got involved. The nascent consortium paid KMI to perform a full\nfeasibility study. Neil Tagare, the former vice president for KMI, visited 25\ncountries to determine their level of need for such a cable. The feasibility\nstudy was completed in late 1990 and looked favorable. The consortium grew to\ninclude the Asian Infrastructure Fund of Hong Kong and Telecom Holding Co.\nLtd. of Thailand. The scope of the project grew also, extending not just to\nthe Middle East but all the way to Tokyo.\n\nNynex took on the role of managing sponsor for the FLAG project. A new company\ncalled Nynex Network Systems (Bermuda) Ltd. was formed to serve as the\nworldwide sales representative for FLAG, and FLAG\u2019s world headquarters was\nsited in Bermuda. This might seem a bit peculiar given that none of the money\ncomes from Bermuda, the cable goes nowhere near Bermuda, and Nynex is centered\nin the northeastern United States. But since FLAG is ultimately owned and\ncontrolled by a Bermuda company and the capacity on the cable is sold out of\nBermuda, the invoices all come out of Bermuda and the money all comes into\nBermuda, which by an odd coincidence happens to be a major corporate tax\nhaven.\n\nNynex also has responsibility for building the FLAG cable system. One might\nthink that a Baby Bell such as Nynex would be a perfect choice for this kind\nof work, but, in fact, Nynex owned none of the factories needed to manufacture\ncable, none of the ships needed to lay it, and not enough of the expertise\nneeded to install it. Nynex does know a thing or two about laying and\noperating terrestrial cable systems \u2013 during the mid-1990s, for example, it\nwired large parts of the United Kingdom with a \u201ccable television\u201d system that\nis actually a generalized digital communication network. But transoceanic\nsubmarine cables were outside of its traditional realm.\n\nOn the other hand, during the early \u201990s, Nynex found itself stymied from\ncompeting in the United States because of regulatory hassles and began looking\noverseas for markets in which to expand. By the time FLAG was conceived,\ntherefore, Nynex had begun to gain experience in the countless pitfalls of\ndoing business in the worldwide telecommunications business, making up a\nlittle bit of AT&T\u2019s daunting lead.\n\nFLAG\u2019s business arrangements were entirely novel. The entire FLAG concept was\nunfeasible unless agreements could be made with so-called landing parties in\neach country along the route. The landing party is the company that owns the\nstation where the cable comes ashore and operates the equipment that patches\nit into the local telecommunications system. The obvious choice for such a\nrole would be a PTT. But many PTTs were reluctant to participate, partly\nbecause this novel arrangement struck them as dubious and partly because they\nweren\u2019t going to end up monopolizing the cable.\n\nOvercoming such opposition was essentially a sales job. John Mercogliano, a\nhigh-intensity New Yorker who is now vice president \u2013 Europe, Nynex Network\nSystems (Bermuda) Ltd., developed a sales pitch that he delivers too rapidly\nfor any hacker tourist to write down but goes something like this: \u201cIn the old\ndays AT&T came in, told you how much to pay, and you raised the money, assumed\nall of the risk, and owned the cable. But now FLAG\u2019s coming in with investors\nwho are going to put in $600 million of their own cash and borrow a billion\nmore without any guaranteed sales, assuming all of the risk. You buy only as\nmuch capacity on FLAG as you want, and meanwhile you have retained your\ncapital, which you can use to upgrade your outdated local infrastructure and\nprovide better service to your customers \u2013 now what the hell is wrong with\nthat?\u201d\n\nThe question hangs in the air provocatively. What the hell is wrong with it?\nPut this way, it seems unbeatable. But a lot of local telecoms turned FLAG\ndown anyway \u2013 at least at first. Why?\n\nThe short answer is that I\u2019m not allowed to tell you. The long answer requires\nan explanation of how a hacker tourist operates; how his methods differ from\nthose of an actual journalist; and just how weird the global telecom business\nis nowadays.\n\nLet\u2019s take the last one first. The business is so tangled that no pure\ncompetition exists. There are no Coke-versus-Pepsi dichotomies. Most of the\ncompanies mentioned in this story are actually whole families of companies,\nand most of those have their fingers in pies in dozens of countries all around\nthe globe. Any two companies that compete in one arena are, at the same time,\nprobably in bed with each other on many other levels. As badly as they might\nwant to slag each other in the press, they dare not.\n\nSo, like those \u201chigh-ranking officials\u201d you\u2019re always reading about in news\nreports from Washington, they all talk on background. Anyone who wants to\nwrite about this business will come off as either a genius with an\nencyclopedic brain or a pathological liar with an axe to grind \u2013 depending on\nthe reader\u2019s point of view \u2013 because all truly interesting information is\ndished out strictly on background.\n\nPerhaps a real journalist would go into Woodward-and-Bernstein mode, find a\nDeep Throat, and lay it all bare. But I\u2019m not a real journalist: I\u2019m a hacker\ntourist, and trying to work up an expos\u00e9 on monopolistic behavior by big bad\ntelecoms would only get in the way of what are, to me, the more interesting\naspects of this story.\n\nSo I\u2019ll just say that a whole lot of important and well-informed people in the\ntelecom business, all over the planet, are laboring under the strange\nimpression that AT&T used its power and influence to discourage smaller\ntelecoms in other countries from signing deals with FLAG.\n\nIn the old days, this would have prevented FLAG from ever coming into\nexistence. But these are the new days, telecom deregulation is creeping slowly\nacross the planet, and many PTTs now have to worry about competition. So the\nresults of the FLAG sales pitch varied from country to country. In some\nplaces, like Singapore, FLAG never made an agreement with anyone and had to\nbypass the country entirely. In other places, the PTT broke ranks with AT&T\nand agreed to land FLAG. In others, the PTT turned it down but an upstart\ncompetitor decided to land FLAG instead, and in still others, the PTT declined\nat first, and then got so worried about the upstart competitor that it changed\nits mind and decided to land FLAG after all.\n\nIt would be very easy for you, dear reader, to underestimate what a sea change\nthis all represents for the clubs. They are not accustomed to having to worry\nabout competition \u2013 it doesn\u2019t come naturally to them. The typical high-\nranking telecom executive is more of a government bureaucrat than a\nbusinessperson, and the entire scenario laid out above is irregular, messy,\nand disturbing to someone like that. A telecrat\u2019s reflex is to assume, smugly,\nthat new carriers simply don\u2019t matter, because no matter how much financing\nand business acumen they may have, no matter how great the demand for their\nservices may be, and no matter how crappy the existing service is, the old PTT\nstill controls the cable, which is the only way to get bits out of the\ncountry. But in the FLAG era, if the customers go to another carrier, that\ncarrier will find a way to get the needed capacity somehow \u2013 at which point it\nis too late for the PTT.\n\nThe local carriers, therefore, need to stop thinking globally and start\nthinking locally. That is, they need to leave long-range cable laying to the\nentrepreneurs, to assume that the bandwidth will always somehow be there, and\nto concentrate on upgrading the quality of their customer service \u2013 in\nparticular, the so-called last mile, the local loop that ties customers into\nthe Net.\n\nBy the end of 1994, FLAG\u2019s Construction and Maintenance Agreement had been\nsigned, and the project was for real. Well before this point, it had become\nobvious to everyone that FLAG was going to happen in some form, so companies\nthat initially might have been hostile began looking for ways to get in on the\naction. The manufacture of the cable and the repeaters had been put out to bid\nin 1993 and had turned into a competition between two consortia, one\nconsisting of AT&T Submarine Systems and KDD Submarine Cable Systems, and the\nother formed around Alcatel and Fujitsu. The former group ended up landing the\ncontract. So AT&T, which evidently felt threatened by the whole premise of the\nFLAG project and according to some people had tried to quash it, ended up with\npart of the contract to manufacture the cable.\n\nIn which the Hacker Tourist returns (temporarily) to British soil in the Far\nEast.

The terms are now used to describe\nmodern, motorized vessels built vaguely along the same lines to perform\nroughly the same functions: a junk is a large, square-assed vessel, and a\nsampan is a small utility craft with an enclosed cabin. Farther out, there are\ntwo barges: slabs with cranes and boxy things on them. Finally, there are\nseveral of what Handley calls LBRBs (Little Bitty Rubber Boats) going back and\nforth between these vessels and the beach. Boeing hydrofoils and turbo cats\nscream back and forth a few miles out, ferrying passengers among various\ndestinations around the Pearl Delta region. It\u2019s a hot day, and kids are\nswimming on the public beach, prudently staying within the line of red buoys\nmarking the antishark net. Handley remarks, offhandedly, that five people have\nbeen eaten so far this year. A bulletin board, in English and Chinese, offers\nadvice: \u201cIf schooling fish start to congregate in unusually large numbers,\nleave the water.\u201d\n\nThis bay is the center of the cable-laying universe because cable layers have\ncongregated here in unusually large numbers and because of those two barges,\nwhich are a damn sight more complicated and expensive than you would ever\nguess from looking at them. These men (they are all men) and equipment have\ncome from all over the world, to land not only FLAG but also, at the same\ntime, another of those third-generation fiber-optic cables, APCN (Asia-Pacific\nCable Network).\n\nIn contrast to other places we visited, virtually no local labor is being used\non Lan Tao. There is hardly a Chinese face to be seen around the work site,\nand when you do see an Asian it tends to be either an Indonesian member of a\nbarge crew or a Singaporean of Chinese or Indian ancestry. Most of the people\nhere are blue-eyed and sunburned. A good half of them have accents that\noriginate from the British Isles. The remainder are from the States\n(frequently Dixie), Australia, or New Zealand, with a smattering from France\nand Germany.\n\nBoth FLAG and APCN are just passing through Hong Kong, not terminating here,\nand so each has to be landed twice (one segment coming in and one segment\ngoing back out). In FLAG\u2019s case, one segment goes south to Songkhla, Thailand,\nand the other goes north toward Shanghai and Korea. It wouldn\u2019t be safe to\nland both segments in the same place, so there are two separate landing sites,\nwith FLAG and APCN cables running side by side at each one. One of the sites\nis at the public beach, which is nice and sandy. The other site is a few\nhundred meters away on a cobble beach \u2013 a hill of rounded stones, fist- to\nfootball-sized, rising up out of the surf and making musical clinking noises\nas the waves smash them up and down the grade. This is a terrible place to\nland a cable (Handley: \u201cIf it was easy, everybody would do it!\u201d) but, as in\nThailand, diversity is the ultimate trump card. Planted above the hill of\ncobbles is a brand-new cable station bearing the Hong Kong Telecom logo, only\none of the spoils soon to be reaped by the People\u2019s Republic of China when all\nthis reverts to its control next year.\n\nLan Tao Island, like most other places where cables are landed, is a peculiar\narea, long home to smugglers and pirates. Some 30,000 people live here, mostly\nconcentrated around Silvermine Bay on the island\u2019s eastern end, where the\nferries come in every hour or so from Hong Kong\u2019s central district, carrying\nboth islanders and tourists. The beaches are lovely, except for the sharks,\nand the interior of the island is mostly unspoiled parkland, popular among\nhikers. Hong Kong\u2019s new airport is being built on reclaimed land attached to\nthe north side of the island, and a monumental chain of bridges and tunnels is\nbeing constructed to connect it with the city. Other than tourist attractions,\nthe island hosts a few oddities such as a prison, a Trappist monastery, a\nvillage on stilts, and the world\u2019s largest outdoor bronze Buddha.\n\nCable trash, as these characters affectionately call themselves, shuttle back\nand forth between Tong Fuk and Silvermine Bay. They all stay at the same hotel\nand tend to spend their off hours at Papa Doc\u2019s (no relation to the Haitian\ndictator), a beachfront bar run by expats (British) for expats (Australians,\nAmericans, Brits, you name it). Papa Doc\u2019s isn\u2019t just for cable layers. It\nalso meets the exacting specifications of exhausted hacker tourists. It\u2019s the\nkind of joint that Humphrey Bogart would be running if he had washed ashore on\nLan Tao in the mid-1990s wearing a nose ring instead of landing in Casablanca\nin the 1940s wearing a fedora.\n\nOne evening, after Handley and I had been buying each other drinks at Papa\nDoc\u2019s for a while, he raised his glass and said, \u201cTo good times and great\ncable laying!\u201d This toast, while no doubt uttered with a certain amount of\nirony, speaks volumes about cable professionals.\n\nFor most of them, good times and great cable laying are one and the same. They\nmake their living doing the kind of work that automatically weeds out losers.\nHandley, for example, was a founding member of SEAL Team 2 who spent 59 months\nfighting in Vietnam, laid cables for the Navy for a few more years, and has\ndone similar work in the civilian world ever since. In addition to being an\nexpert diver, he has a master mariner\u2019s license good up to 1,500 tons, which\nis not an easy thing to get or maintain. He does all his work on a laptop (he\nclaims that it replaced 14 employees) and is as computer-literate as anyone\nI\u2019ve known who isn\u2019t a coder.\n\nHandley is unusual in combining all of these qualities into one person (that\u2019s\nwhy he\u2019s the boss of the Lan Tao Island operation), but the qualities are as\ncommon as tattoos and Tevas around the tables of Papa Doc\u2019s. The crews of the\ncable barges tend to be jacks-of-all-trades: ship\u2019s masters who also know how\nto dive using various types of breathing rigs or who can slam out a report on\ntheir laptops, embed a few digital images in it, and email it to the other\nside of the world over a satellite phone, then pick up a welding torch and go\nto work on the barge. If these people didn\u2019t know what they were doing,\nthere\u2019s a good chance they would be dead by now or would have screwed up a\ncable lay somewhere and washed out of the industry.\n\nMost of the ones here work on what amounts to a freelance basis, either on\ntheir own or as part of small firms. Handley, for example, is Director of\nTechnical Services for the ITR Corporation, which, among other functions,\nserves as a sort of talent agency for cable-layers, matching supply of\nexpertise to demand and facilitating contracts. Most of the divers are\nfreelancers, hired temporarily by companies that likewise move from one job to\nanother. The business is as close to being a pure meritocracy as anything ever\ngets in the real world, and it\u2019s only because these guys know they are good\nthat they have the confidence to call themselves cable trash.\n\nIt was not always thus. Until very recently, cable-laying talent was\nmonopolized by the clubs. This worked just fine when every cable was a club\ncable, created by monopolies for monopolies. In the last couple of years,\nhowever, two changes have occurred at once: FLAG, the first major privately\nfinanced cable, came along; and at the same time, many experienced cable\nlayers began to go into business for themselves, either because of voluntary\nretirement or downsizing. There clearly is a synergy between these two trends.\n\nThe roster of FLAG\u2019s Tong Fuk cable lay contains around 44 people, half of\nwhom are crew members on either the cable barge Elbe or the accompanying tug\nOcean East. The rest of them are here representing various contractors\ninvolved in the project. It would be safe to assume that at least that many\nare working on the APCN side for a grand total of around 100.\n\nThe size of the fraternity of cable layers is estimated by Handley to be less\nthan 500, and the number is not increasing. A majority work full time for one\nof the clubs. Perhaps a couple of hundred of them are freelancers, though this\nfraction gives every indication of rising as the club employees resign and go\nto work as contractors, frequently doing the same work for the same company.\n\u201cNo one can afford to hire these folks for long periods of time,\u201d Handley\nsays. But their pay is not exceptionally high: benefits, per diem, and\nexpenses plus a daily rate \u2013 but a day might be anything from 0 to 24 hours of\nwork. For a diver the rate might be $200 per day; for the master of a barge,\ntug, or beach $300; and for the experts running the show and repping for\ncontractors or customers it\u2019s in the range of $300 to $400.\n\nThe arrival of a shore-landing operation at a place like Lan Tao Island must\nlook something like this to the locals: suddenly, it is difficult to obtain\nhotel rooms because a plethora of small, unheard-of offshore corporations have\nblocked out a couple of dozen rooms for a couple hundred nights. Sunburned\nAnglos begin to arrive, wearing T-shirts and carrying luggage emblazoned with\nthe logos of Alcatel, AT&T, or Cable & Wireless. They fly in from all points\nof the compass, speaking in Southern drawls or Australian twangs or Scottish\nburrs and sometimes bringing their wives or girlfriends, not infrequently Thai\nor Filipina. The least important of them has a laptop and a cell phone, but\nmost have more advanced stuff like portable printers, GPS units, and that\nultimate personal communications device, the satellite telephone, which works\nanywhere on the planet, even in the middle of the ocean, by beaming the call\nstraight up to a satellite.\n\nSample conversation at Papa Doc\u2019s:\n\nEnvious hacker tourist: \u201cHow much does one of those satellite phones cost,\nanyway?\u201d\n\nLeathery, veteran cable layer: \u201cWho gives a shit?\u201d\n\nWithin a day or two, the cable layers have established an official haunt:\npreferably a place equipped with a dartboard and a few other amenities very\nclose to the waterfront so they can keep an eye on incoming traffic. There\nthey can get a bite to eat or a drink and pay for it on the spot so that when\ntheir satellite phones ring or when a tugboat chugs into the bay, they can\nimmediately dash off to work. These men work and play at completely erratic\nand unpredictable hours. They wear shorts and sandals and T-shirts and\nfrequently sport tattoos and hence could easily be mistaken, at a glance, for\nvacationing sailors. But if you can get someone to turn down the volume on the\njukebox, you can overhear them learnedly discoursing on flaw propagation in\nthe crystalline structure of boron silicate glass or on seasonal variation of\ncurrents in the Pearl River estuary, or on what a pain in the ass it is to\nhelm a large ship through the Suez Canal. Their conversation is filled with\nreferences to places like Tunisia, Diego Garcia, the North Sea, Porthcurno,\nand Penang.\n\nOne day a barge appears off the cove, and there is a lot of fussing around\nwith floats, lots of divers in the water. A backhoe digs a trench in the\ncobble beach. A long skinny black thing is wrestled ashore. Working almost\nnaked in the tropical heat, the men bolt segmented pipes around it and then\nbury it. It is never again to be seen by human eyes. Suddenly, all of these\nmen pay their bills and vanish. Not long afterward, the phone service gets a\nhell of a lot better.\n\nOn land, the tools of cable laying are the tools of civil engineers: backhoes,\nshovels, cranes. The job is a matter of digging a ditch, laying duct, planting\nmanholes. The complications are sometimes geographical but mostly political.\nIn deep water, where the majority of FLAG is located, the work is done by\ncable ships and has more in common with space exploration than with any\nterrestrial activity. These two realms could hardly be more different, and yet\nthe transition between them \u2013 the shore landing \u2013 is completely distinct from\nboth.\n\nShallow water is the most perilous part of a cable\u2019s route. Extra precautions\nmust be taken in the transition from deep water to the beach, and these\nprecautions get more extreme as the water gets more shallow. Between 1,000 and\n3,000 meters, the cable has a single layer of armor wires (steel rods about as\nthick as a pencil) around it. In less than 1,000 meters of water, it has a\nsecond layer of armor around the first. In the final approach to the\nshoreline, this double-armored cable is contained within a massive shell of\narticulated cast-iron pipe, which in turn is buried under up to a meter of\nsand.\n\nThe articulated pipe comes in sections half a meter long, which have to be\nmanually fit around the cable and bolted together. Each section of pipe\ninterlocks with the ones on either end of it. The coupling is designed to bend\na certain amount so that the cable can be snaked around any obstructions to\nits destination: the beach manhole. It will bend only so much, however, so\nthat the cable\u2019s minimum radius of curvature will not be violated.\n\nAt the sandy beach this manual work was done out in the surf by a team of\nEnglish freelance divers based out of Hong Kong. At the cobble beach, it was\ndone in a trench by a bikini-underwear-clad Frenchman with a New Zealand\npassport living in Singapore, working in Hong Kong, with a Singaporean wife of\nChinese descent. Drenched with sweat and rain and seawater, he wrestles with\nthe cast-iron pipe sections in a cobblestone ditch, bolting them patiently\ntogether. A Chinese man in a suit picks his way across the cobbles toward him,\ncarrying an oversized umbrella emblazoned with the logo of a prominent stock\nbrokerage, followed by a minion. Although this is all happening in China, this\nis the first Chinese person who has appeared on the beach in a couple of days.\nHe is an executive from the phone company, coming to inspect the work. After a\nstiff exchange of pleasantries with the other cable layers on the beach, he\ngoes to the brink of the trench and begins bossing around the man with the\nhalf-pipes, who, knowing what\u2019s good for him, just keeps his mouth shut while\nmaintaining a certain bearing and dignity beside which the executive\u2019s suit\nand umbrella seem pathetic and vain.\n\nTo a hacker tourist, the scene is strikingly familiar: it is the ancient\nhacker-versus-suit drama, enacted for the millionth time but sticking to its\ntraditional structure as strictly as a Noh play or, for that matter, a Dilbert\ncartoon. Cable layers, like hackers, scorn credentials, etiquette, and nice\nclothes. Anyone who can do the work is part of the club. Nothing else matters.\nSuits are a bizarre intrusion from an irrational world. They have undeniable\nauthority, but heaven only knows how they acquired it. This year, the suits\nare from Hong Kong, which means they are probably smarter than the average\nsuit. Pretty soon the suits will be from Beijing, but Beijing doesn\u2019t know how\nto lay cable either, so if they ever want to get bits in or out of their\ncountry, they will have to reach an understanding with these guys.\n\nAt Tong Fuk, FLAG is encased in pipe out to a distance of some 300 meters from\nthe beach manhole. When the divers have got all of that pipe bolted on, which\nwill take a week or so, they will make their way down the line with a water\njet that works by fluidizing the seabed beneath it, turning it into quicksand.\nThe pipe sinks into the quicksand, which eventually compacts, leaving no trace\nof the buried pipe.\n\nBeyond 300 meters, the cable must still be buried to protect it from anchors,\ntickler chains, and otter boards (more about this later). This is the job of\nthe two barges we saw off Tong Fuk. One, the Elbe, was burying FLAG. The other\nwas burying APCN. Elbe did its job in one-third the time, with one-third the\ncrew, perhaps exemplifying the difference between FLAG\u2019s freelance-based\nvirtual-corporation business model versus the old club model. The Elbe crew is\nGerman, British, Filipino, Singaporean-of-Indian-ancestry, New Zealander, and\nalso includes a South African diver.\n\nIn the center of the barge is a tank where the cable is spooled. The thick,\nheavy armored cable that the Elbe works with is covered with a jacket of\ntarred jute, which gives it an old-fashioned look that belies its high tech\noptical-fiber innards. The tar likes to melt and stick the cable together, so\neach layer of cable in the tank is separated from its neighbors by wooden\nslats, and buckets of talc are slathered over it. The cable emerges from the\nopen top of the tank and passes through a series of rollers that curve around,\nlooking very much like a miniature roller-coaster track \u2013 these are built in\nsuch a way as to bend the cable through a particular trajectory without\nviolating its minimum radius of curvature. They feed it into the top of the\ninjector unit.\n\nThe injector is a huge steel cleaver, 7 meters high and 2 or 3 meters broad,\nrigged to the side of the barge so it can slide up and down and thus be jammed\ndirectly into the seabed. But instead of a cutting blade on its leading edge,\nit has a row of hardened-steel injector nozzles that spurt highly pressurized\nwater, piped in from a huge pump buried in the Elbe\u2018s engine room. These\nnozzles fluidize the seabed and thus make it possible for the giant blade to\npenetrate it. Along the trailing edge of the blade runs a channel for the\ncable so that as the blade works its way forward, the cable is gently laid\ninto the bottom of the slit. The barge carries a set of extensions that can be\nbolted onto the top of the injector so it can operate in water as deep as 40\nmeters, burying the cable as deep as 9 meters beneath the seabed. This\nsufficed to lay the cable out for a distance of 10 kilometers from Tong Fuk.\nLater, another barge, the Chinann, will come to continue work out to 100\nmeters deep and will bury both legs of the FLAG cable for another 60\nkilometers out to get them through a dangerous anchorage zone.\n\nThe Elbe has its own tugboat, the Ocean East, staffed with an Indonesian crew.\nRelations between the two vessels have been a bit tense because the\nIndonesians butchered and ate all of the Elbe\u2018s laying hens, terminating the\negg supply. But it all seemed to have been patched up when we were there; no\none was fretting about it except for the Elbe\u2018s rooster. When the Elbe is more\nthan half a kilometer from shore, Ocean East pulls her along by means of a\ncable. The tug\u2019s movements are controlled from the Elbe\u2018s bridge over a radio\nlink. Closer to shore, the Elbe drops an anchor and then pulls itself along by\nwinching the line in. She can get more power by using the Harbormaster\nthruster units mounted on each of her ends. But the main purpose of these\nthrusters is to provide side propulsion so the barge\u2019s movements can be finely\ncontrolled.\n\nThe nerve center of the Elbe is a raised, air-conditioned bridge jammed with\nthe electronic paraphernalia characteristic of modern ships, such as a\nsatellite phone, a fax machine, a plotter, and a Navtex machine to receive\nmeteorological updates. Probably the most important equipment is the\ndifferential GPS system that tells the barge\u2019s operators exactly where they\nare with respect to the all-important Route Position List: a series of points\nprovided by the surveyors. Their job is to connect these dots with cable.\nElbe\u2018s bridge normally sports four different computers all concerned with\nnavigation and station-keeping functions. In addition to this complement,\nduring the Tong Fuk cable lay, Dave Handley was up here with his laptop,\ntaking down data important to FLAG, while the representatives from AT&T and\nCable & Wireless were also present with their laptops compiling their own\ndata.\n\nHey, wait a minute, the hacker tourist says to himself, I thought AT&T was the\nenemy. What\u2019s an AT&T guy doing on the bridge of the Elbe, side-by-side with\nDave Handley?\n\nThe answer is that the telecom business is an unfathomably complicated snarl\nof relationships. Not only did AT&T (along with KDD) end up with the contract\nto supply FLAG\u2019s cable, it also ended up landing a great deal of the\ninstallation work. Not that many companies have what it takes to manage an\ninstallation of FLAG\u2019s magnitude. AT&T is one of them and Nynex isn\u2019t. So it\nfrequently happens at FLAG job sites that AT&T will be serving as the\ncontractor, making the local contacts and organizing the work, while FLAG\u2019s\npresence will be limited to one or two reps whose allegiance is to the\ninvestors and whose job it is to make sure it\u2019s all done the FLAG way, as\nopposed to the AT&T way. As with any other construction project from a\ndoghouse on upward, countless decisions must be made on the site, and here\nthey need to be made the way a group of private investors would make them \u2013\nnot the way a club would.\n\nIf FLAG\u2019s investors spent any time at all looking into the history of the\ncable-laying business, this topic must have given them a few sleepless nights.\nThe early years of the industry were filled with decision making that can most\ncharitably be described as colorful. In those days, there were no experienced\nold hands. They just made everything up as they went along, and as often as\nnot, they got it wrong.\n\nThomson and Whitehouse\n\nAs of 1861, some 17,500 kilometers of submarine cable had been laid in various\nplaces around the world, of which only about 5,000 kilometers worked. The\nremaining 12,500 kilometers represented a loss to their investors, and most of\nthese lost investments were long cables such as the ones between Britain and\nthe United States and Britain and India (3,500 and 5,600 kilometers,\nrespectively). Understanding why long cables failed was not a trivial problem;\nit defeated eminent scientists like Rankine and Siemens and was solved, in the\nend, only by William Thomson.\n\nIn prospect, it probably looked like it was going to be easy. Insulated\ntelegraph wires strung from pole to pole worked just as one might expect, and\nso, assuming that watertight insulation could be found, similar wires laid\nunder the ocean should work just as well. The insulation was soon found in the\nform of gutta-percha. Very long gutta-percha-insulated wires were built. They\nworked fine when laid out on the factory floor and tested. But when immersed\nin water they worked poorly, if at all.\n\nThe problem was that water, unlike air, is an electrical conductor, which is\nto say that charged particles are free to move around in it. When a pulse of\nelectrons moves down an immersed cable, it repels electrons in the surrounding\nseawater, creating a positively charged pulse in the water outside. These two\ncharged regions interact with each other in such a way as to smear out the\noriginal pulse moving down the wire. The operator at the receiving end sees\nonly a slow upward trend in electrical charge, instead of a crisp jump. If the\nsending operator transmitted the different pulses \u2013 the dots and dashes \u2013 too\nclose together, they\u2019d blur as they moved down the wire.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not the only thing happening in that wire. Long cables\nact as antennae, picking up all kinds of stray currents as the rotation of the\nEarth, and its revolution around the sun, sweep them across magnetic fields of\nterrestrial and celestial origin. At the Museum of Submarine Telegraphy in\nPorthcurno, Cornwall (which we\u2019ll visit later), is a graph of the so-called\nEarth current measured in a cable that ran from there to Harbor Grace,\nNewfoundland, decades ago. Over a period of some 72 hours, the graph showed a\nvariation in the range of 100 volts. Unfortunately, the amplitude of the\ntelegraph signal was only 70 volts. So the weak, smeared-out pulses making\ntheir way down the cable would have been almost impossible to hear above the\nmusic of the spheres.\n\nFinally, leakage in the cable\u2019s primitive insulation was inevitable. All of\nthese influences, added together, meant that early telegraphers could send\nanything they wanted into the big wire, but the only thing that showed up at\nthe other end was noise.\n\nThese problems were known, but poorly understood, in the mid-1850s when the\nfirst transatlantic cable was being planned. They had proved troublesome but\nmanageable in the early cables that bridged short gaps, such as between\nEngland and Ireland. No one knew, yet, what would happen in a much longer\ncable system. The best anyone could do, short of building one, was to make\npredictions.\n\nThe Victorian era was an age of superlatives and larger-than-life characters,\nand as far as that goes, Dr. Wildman Whitehouse fit right in: what Victoria\nwas to monarchs, Dickens to novelists, Burton to explorers, Robert E. Lee to\ngenerals, Dr. Wildman Whitehouse was to assholes. He achieved a level of pure\naccomplishment in this field that the Alfonse D\u2019Amatos of our time can only\ndream of. The only 19th-century figure who even comes close to him in this\ndepartment is Custer. In any case, Dr. Edward Orange Wildman Whitehouse\nfancied himself something of an expert on electricity. His rival was William\nThomson, 10 years younger, a professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow\nUniversity who was infatuated with Fourier analysis, a new and extremely\npowerful tool that happened to be perfectly suited to the problem of how to\nsend electrical pulses down long submarine cables.\n\nWildman Whitehouse predicted that sending bits down long undersea cables was\ngoing to be easy (the degradation of the signal would be proportional to the\nlength of the cable) and William Thomson predicted that it was going to be\nhard (proportional to the length of the cable squared). Naturally, they both\nended up working for the same company at the same time.\n\nWhitehouse was a medical doctor, hence working in the wrong field, and\nprobably trailed Thomson by a good 50 or 100 IQ points. But that didn\u2019t stop\nWhitehouse. In 1856, he published a paper stating that Thomson\u2019s theories\nconcerning the proposed transatlantic cable were balderdash. The two men got\ninto a public argument, which became extremely important in 1858 when the\nAtlantic Telegraph Company laid such a cable from Ireland to Newfoundland: a\ncopper core sheathed in gutta-percha and wrapped in iron wires.\n\nThis cable was, to put it mildly, a bad idea, given the state of cable science\nand technology at the time. The notion of copper as a conductor for\nelectricity, as opposed to a downspout material, was still extraordinary, and\nit was impossible to obtain the metal in anything like a pure form. The cable\nwas slapped together so shoddily that in some places the core could be seen\npoking out through its gutta-percha insulation even before it was loaded onto\nthe cable-laying ship. But venture capitalists back then were a more rugged \u2013\nnot to say crazy \u2013 breed, and there can be no better evidence than that they\nlet Wildman Whitehouse stay on as the Atlantic Telegraph Company\u2019s chief\nelectrician long after his deficiencies had become conspicuous.\n\nThe physical process of building and laying the cable makes for a wild tale in\nand of itself. But to do it justice, I would have to double the length of this\nalready herniated article. Let\u2019s just say that after lots of excitement, they\nput a cable in place between Ireland and Newfoundland. But for all of the\nreasons mentioned earlier, it hardly worked at all. Queen Victoria managed to\nsend President Buchanan a celebratory message, but it took a whole day to send\nit. On a good day, the cable could carry something like one word per minute.\nThis fact was generally hushed up, but the important people knew about it \u2013 so\nthe pressure was on Wildman Whitehouse, whose theories were blatantly\ncontradicted by the facts.\n\nWhitehouse convinced himself that the solution to their troubles was brute\nforce \u2013 send the message at extremely high voltages. To that end, he invented\nand patented a set of 5-foot-long induction coils capable of ramming 2,000\nvolts into the cable. When he hooked them up to the Ireland end of the system,\nhe soon managed to blast a hole through the gutta-percha somewhere between\nthere and Newfoundland, turning the entire system into useless junk.\n\nLong before this, William Thomson had figured out, by dint of Fourier\nanalysis, that incoming bits could be detected much faster by a more sensitive\ninstrument. The problem was that instruments in those days had to work by\nphysically moving things around, for example, by closing an electromagnetic\nrelay that would sound a buzzer. Moving things around requires power, and the\nbits on a working transatlantic cable embodied very little power. It was\ndifficult to make a physical object small enough to be susceptible to such\nghostly traces of current.\n\nThomson\u2019s solution (actually, the first of several solutions) was the mirror\ngalvanometer, which incorporated a tiny fleck of reflective material that\nwould twist back and forth in the magnetic field created by the current in the\nwire. A beam of light reflecting from the fleck would swing back and forth\nlike a searchlight, making a dim spot on a strip of white paper. An observer\nwith good eyesight sitting in a darkened room could tell which way the current\nwas flowing by watching which way the spot moved. Current flowing in one\ndirection signified a Morse code dot, in the other a dash. In fact, the\ninformation that had been transmitted down the cable in the brief few weeks\nbefore Wildman Whitehouse burned it to a crisp had been detected using\nThomson\u2019s mirror galvanometer \u2013 though Whitehouse denied it.\n\nAfter the literal burnout of the first transatlantic cable, Wildman Whitehouse\nand Professor Thomson were grilled by a committee of eminent Victorians who\nwere seriously pissed off at Whitehouse and enthralled with Thomson, even\nbefore they heard any testimony \u2013 and they heard a lot of testimony.\nWhitehouse disappeared into ignominy. Thomson ended up being knighted and\nlater elevated to a baron by Queen Victoria. He became Lord Kelvin and\neventually got an important unit of measurement, an even more important law of\nphysics, and a refrigerator named after him.\n\nEight years after Whitehouse fried the first, a second transatlantic cable was\nbuilt to Lord Kelvin\u2019s specifications with his patented mirror galvanometers\nat either end of it. He bought a 126-ton schooner yacht with the stupendous\namount of money he made from his numerous cable-related patents, turned the\nship into a floating luxury palace and laboratory for the invention of even\nmore fantastically lucrative patents. He then spent the rest of his life\ntooling around the British Isles, Bay of Biscay, and western Mediterranean,\nfrequently hosting Dukes and continental savants who all commented on the\nnerd-lord\u2019s tendency to stop in the middle of polite conversation to scrawl\nout long skeins of equations on whatever piece of paper happened to be handy.\n\nKelvin went on to design and patent other devices for extracting bits from the\nends of cables, and other engineers went to work on the problem, too. By the\n1920s, the chore of translating electrical pulses into letters had been\nlargely automated. Now, of course, humans are completely out of the loop.\n\nThe number of people working in cable landing stations is probably about the\nsame as it was in Kelvin\u2019s day. But now they are merely caretakers for\nmachines that process bits about as fast as a billion telegraphers working in\nparallel.\n\nThe Hacker Tourist travels to the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nTechnological wonders of modern cable stations. Why Ugandans could not place\ntelephone calls to Seattle. Trawlers, tickler chains, teredo worms, and other\nhazards to undersea cables. The immense financial stakes involved \u2013 why cable\nowners do not care for the company of fishermen,and vice versa.\n\n35\u00b0 17.690\u2032 N, 139\u00b0 46.328\u2032 EKDD Cable Landing Station, Ninomiya, Japan\n\nWhether they are in Thailand, Egypt, or Japan, modern cable landing stations\nhave much in common with each other. Shortly after touching down in Tokyo, we\nwere standing in KDD\u2019s landing station in Ninomiya, Japan. I\u2019ll describe it to\nyou.\n\nA surprising amount of space in the station is devoted to electrical gear. The\nstation must not lose power, so there are two separate, redundant emergency\ngenerators. There is also likely to be a transformer to supply power to the\ncable system. We think of optical fibers as delicate strands consuming\nnegligible power, but all of those repeaters, spaced every few dozen\nkilometers across an ocean, end up consuming a lot of juice: for a big\ntransoceanic cable, one or two amperes at 7,000 or so volts, for a total of\nsomething like 10,000 watts. The equipment handling that power makes a hum you\ncan feel in your bones, kicking the power out not along wires but solid copper\nbars suspended from the ceiling, with occasional sections of massive braided\nmetal ribbon so they won\u2019t snap in an earthquake.\n\nThe emergency generators are hooked into a battery farm that fills a room. The\nbatteries are constantly trickle-charged and exist simply to provide power\nduring an emergency \u2013 after the regular power goes out but before the\ngenerators kick in. Most of the equipment in the cable station is computer\ngear that demands a stable temperature, so there are two separate, redundant\nair-conditioning plants feeding into a big system of ventilation ducts. The\nequipment must not get dirty or get fried by sparks from the fingers of hacker\ntourists, so you leave your shoes by the door and slip into plastic antistatic\nflip-flops. The equipment must not get smashed up in earthquakes, so the\nbuilding is built like a brick shithouse.\n\nThe station is no more than a few hundred meters from a beach. Sandy beaches\nin out-of-the-way areas are preferred. The cable comes in under the sand until\nit hits a beach manhole, where it continues through underground ducts until it\ncomes up out of the floor of the cable station into a small, well-secured\nroom. The cable is attached to something big and strong, such as a massive\nsteel grid bolted into the wall. Early cable technicians were sometimes\nstartled to see their cables suddenly jerk loose from their moorings inside\nthe station \u2013 yanking the guts out of expensive pieces of equipment \u2013 and\ndisappear in the direction of the ocean, where a passing ship had snagged\nthem.\n\nFrom holes in the floor, the cables pass up into boxes where all the armor and\ninsulation are stripped away from them and where the tubular power lead\nsurrounding the core is connected to the electrical service (7,500 volts in\nthe case of FLAG) that powers the repeaters out in the middle of the ocean.\nIts innards then con-tinue, typically in some kind of overhead wiring plenum\n(a miniature catwalk suspended from the ceiling) into the Big Room Full of\nExpensive Stuff.\n\nThe Big Room Full of Expensive Stuff is at least 25 meters on a side and\ncommonly has a floor made of removable, perforated plates covering plenums\nthrough which wires can be routed, an overhead grid of open plenums from which\nwires descend like jungle vines, or both. Most of the room is occupied by\nequipment racks arranged in parallel rows (think of the stacks at a big\nlibrary). The racks are tall, well over most people\u2019s heads, and their insides\nare concealed and protected by face plates bearing corporate logos: AT&T,\nAlcatel, Fujitsu. In the case of an optical cable like FLAG, they contain the\nLight Terminal: the gear that converts the 1,558-nanometer signal lasers\ncoming down the fiber strands into digits within an electrical circuit, and\nvice versa. The Light Terminal is contained within a couple of racks that,\ntaken together, are about the size of a refrigerator.\n\nAll the other racks of gear filling the room cope with the unfathomable\nhassles associated with trying to funnel that many bits into and out of the\nfiber. In the end, that gear is, of course, connected to the local\ntelecommunications system in some way. Hence one commonly sees microwave relay\ntowers on top of these buildings and lots of manholes in the streets around\nthem. One does not, however, see a lot of employees, because for the most part\nthis equipment runs itself. Every single circuit board in every slot of every\nlevel of every rack in the whole place has a pair of copper wires coming out\nof it to send an alarm signal in the event that the board fails. Like tiny\nrivulets joining together into a mighty river, these come together into\nbundles as thick as your leg that snake beneath the floor plates to an alarm\ncenter where they are patched into beautiful rounded clear plastic cases\nenclosing grids of interconnect pins. From here they are tied into\ncommunications lines that run all the way to Tokyo so that everything on the\npremises can be monitored remotely during nights and weekends. Ninomiya is\nstaffed with nine employees and Miura, FLAG\u2019s other Japanese landing point,\nonly one.\n\nWith one notable exception, the hacker tourist sees no particular evidence\nthat any of this has the slightest thing to do with communications. It might\nas well be the computer room at a big university or insurance company. The one\nexception is a telephone handset hanging on a hook on one of the equipment\nracks. The handset is there, but there\u2019s no keypad. Above it is a sign bearing\nthe name of a city far, far away. \u201cHa, ha!\u201d I said, the first time I saw one\nof these, \u201cthat\u2019s for talking to the guy in California, right?\u201d To my\nembarrassment, my tour guides nodded yes. Each cable system has something\ncalled the order wire, which enables the technicians at opposite ends of the\ncable to talk to each other. At a major landing station you will see several\norder wires labeled with the names of exotic-sounding cities on the opposite\nside of the nearest large body of water.\n\nThat is the bare minimum that you will see at any cable station. At Ninomiya\nyou see a bit more, and therein lies something of a tale.\n\nNinomiya is by far the oldest of KDD\u2019s seven cable landing stations, having\nbeen built in 1964 to land TPC-1, which connected Japan to Guam and hence to\nthe United States. Unlike many of FLAG\u2019s other landing sites, which are still\ntorn up by backhoe tracks, it is surrounded by perfectly maintained gardens\nmarred only by towering gray steel poles with big red lights on them aimed out\ntoward the sea in an attempt to dissuade mariners from dropping anchor\nanywhere nearby. Ninomiya served as a training ground for Japanese cable\ntalent. Some of the people who learned the trade there are among the top\nexecutives in KDD\u2019s hierarchy today.\n\nDuring the 1980s, when Americans started to get freaked out about Japan again,\nwe heard a great deal about Japanese corporations\u2019 patient, long-term approach\nto R&D and how vastly superior it was to American companies\u2019 stupid, short-\nterm approach. Since American news media are at least as stupid and short-term\nas the big corporations they like to bitch about, we have heard very little\nfollow-up to such stories in recent years, which is kind of disappointing\nbecause I was sort of wondering how it was all going to turn out. But now the\nformerly long-term is about to come due.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, the generation of cable-savvy KDD men who had\ncut their teeth at Ninomiya had reached the level where they could begin\ndiverting corporate resources into R&D programs. Tohru Ohta, who today is the\nexecutive vice president of KDD, managed to pry some money loose and get it\ninto the hands of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dr. Yasuhiko Niiro, who launched one of those\nvaunted far-sighted Japanese R&D programs at Ninomiya. The terminal building\nfor TPC-1, which had been the center of the Japanese international\ntelecommunications network in 1964, was relegated to a laboratory for Niiro.\nThe goal was to make KDD a player in the optical-fiber submarine cable\nmanufacturing business.\n\nSuch a move was not without controversy in the senior ranks of KDD, who had\ndevoted themselves to a very different corporate mission. In 1949, when Japan\nwas still being run by Douglas MacArthur and the country was trying to dig out\nfrom the rubble of the war, Nippon Telephone & Telegraph (NT&T) split off its\ninternational department into a new company called Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co.,\nLtd. (KDD), which means International Telegraph & Telephone. KDD was much\nsmaller and more focused than NT&T, and this was for a reason: Japan\u2019s\ninternational communications system was a shambles, and nothing was more\nimportant to the country\u2019s economic recovery than that it be rehabilitated as\nquickly as possible. The hope was that KDD would be more nimble and agile than\nits lumbering parent and get the job done faster.\n\nThis strategy seems to have more or less worked. Obviously, Japan has\nsucceeded in the world of international business. It is connected to the\nUnited States by numerous transpacific cables; lines to the outside world are\nplentiful. Of course, since KDD enjoyed monopoly status for a long time, the\nfact that these lines are plentiful has never led to their being cheap. Still,\nthe system worked. Like much else that worked in Japan\u2019s postwar economy, it\nsucceeded, in those early years, precisely insofar as it worked hand-in-glove\nwith American companies and institutions. AT&T, in other words.\n\nUnlike the United States or France or Great Britain, Japan was never much of a\nplayer in the submarine cable business back in the prewar days, and so Ohta\u2019s\nand Niiro\u2019s notion of going into head-to-head competition against AT&T, its\npostwar sugar daddy, might have seemed audacious. KDD had customarily been so\nclose to AT&T that many Japanese mocked it cruelly. AT&T is the sumo champion,\nthey said, and KDD is its koshi-ginchaku, its belt-holding assistant. The word\nliterally means waist purse but seems to have rude connotations along the\nlines of jockstrap carrier.\n\nAgainst all of that, the only thing that Ohta and Niiro had to go on was the\nfact that their idea was a really, really good one. Building cables is just\nthe kind of thing that Japanese industry is good at: a highly advanced form of\nmanufacturing that requires the very best quality control. Cables and\nrepeaters have to work for at least 25 years under some really unpleasant\nconditions.\n\nKDD Submarine Cable Systems (KDD-SCS) built its first optical fiber submarine\ncable system, TPC-3, in 1989 and will soon have more than 100,000 kilometers\nof cable in service worldwide. It designs and holds the patents on the\nterminal equipment that we saw at Ninomiya, though the equipment itself is\nmanufactured by electronics giants like Toshiba and NEC. KDD-SCS is building\nsome of the cable and repeaters that make up FLAG, and AT&T-SSI is building\nthe rest. A problem has already surfaced in the AT&T repeaters \u2013 they switched\nto a different soldering technique which turns out to be not such a good idea.\nEleven of the repeaters that AT&T made for FLAG have this problem, and all of\nthem are lying on the bottom of oceans with bits running through them \u2013 for\nnow. FLAG and AT&T are still studying this problem and trying to decide how to\nresolve it. Still, everyone in the cable business knows what happened \u2013 it has\nto be considered a major win for KDD-SCS.\n\nSo when KDD threw some of its resources into one of those famous far-sighted\nlong-range Japanese R&D programs, it paid off beautifully. In the field of\nsubmarine cable systems, the lowly assistant has taught the sumo champion a\nlesson and sent him reeling back \u2013 not quite out of the ring, but certainly\nenough to get his attention. How, you might ask, is the rest of KDD doing?\n\nThe answer is that, like most other PTTs, it\u2019s showing its age. Even the\ntactful Japanese are willing to admit that they have performed poorly in the\nworld of international telecommunications compared to other countries. Non-\nJapanese will tell you the same thing more enthusiastically.\n\nThe telco deregulation wars have begun in Japan as they have almost everywhere\nelse, and KDD now has competitors in the form of International Digital\nCommunications Inc. (IDC), which owns the Miura station, the other FLAG\nlanding spot. In order to succeed in this competition, KDD needs to invest a\nlot of money, but the very smallness that made it such a good idea in 1949\nputs it at a disadvantage when large amounts of capital are needed.\n\nJust as Ninomiya is a generic cable landing, so KDD is something of a generic\nPTT, facing many of the same troubles that others do. For example: the\nJapanese telecommunications ministry continues to set rates at an artificially\nhigh level. At first blush, this would seem to help KDD by making it much more\ndifficult for upstarts like IDC to compete with them. But in fact it has\nopened the door to an unexpected form of competition: callback.\n\nCallback and Kallback are registered trademarks of Seattle-based International\nTelcom Ltd. (ITL), but, like band-aid and kleenex, tend to be used in a\ngeneric way by people overseas. The callback concept is based on the fact that\nit\u2019s much cheaper to call Japan from the US than it is to call the US from\nJapan. Subscribers to a callback service are given a phone number in the US.\nWhen they want to make a call, they dial that number, wait for it to ring\nonce, and then hang up so they won\u2019t be charged for the call. In the jargon of\nthe callback world, this is the trigger call. A system in the US then calls\nthem back, giving them a cheap international line, and once that is\naccomplished, it\u2019s an easy matter to shunt the call elsewhere: to a number in\nthe States or in any other country in the world.\n\nAny phone call made between two countries is subject to a so-called settlement\ncharge, which is assessed on a per-minute basis. The amount of the settlement\ncharged is fixed by an agreement between the two countries\u2019 PTTs and generally\nprovides a barometer of their relative size and power. So, for example, when\nworking out the deal with Denmark, Pakistan might say, \u201cHey, Danes are rich,\nand we don\u2019t really care whether they call us or not, and they have no\nparticular leverage over us \u2013 so POW!\u201d and insist on a high settlement charge\n\u2013 say $4 per minute. But when negotiating against AT&T, Pakistan might agree\nto a lower settlement charge \u2013 say $1 per minute.\n\nSettlement charges have long been a major source of foreign exchange for\ndeveloping countries\u2019 PTTs and hence for their governments and any crooked\nofficials who may be dipping into the money stream. In some underdeveloped\nnations, they have been the major \u2013 verging on the only \u2013 source of such\nincome. But not for long.\n\nNowadays, a Dane who makes lot of international calls will subscribe to a\nservice such as ITL\u2019s Kallback. He makes a trigger call to Kallback\u2019s computer\nin Seattle, which, since it is an incomplete call, costs him nothing. The\ncomputer phones him back within a few seconds. He then punches in the number\nhe wants to call in Pakistan, and the computer in Seattle places the call for\nhim and makes the connection. Since Pakistan\u2019s PTT has no way to know that the\ncall originates in Denmark, it assesses the lower AT&T settlement charge. The\ntotal settlement charge ends up being much less than what the Dane would have\npaid if he\u2019d dialed Pakistan directly. In other words, two calls from the US,\none to point A and one to point B, are cheaper than one direct call from point\nA to point B.\n\nKDD, like many other PTTs around the world, has tried to crack down on\ncallback services by compiling lists of the callback numbers and blocking\ncalls to those numbers. When I talked to Eric Doescher, ITL\u2019s director of\nmarketing, I expected him to be outraged about such attacks. But it soon\nbecame evident that if he ever felt that way, he long ago got over it and now\nviews all such efforts with jaded amusement. \u201cIn Uganda,\u201d he said, \u201cthe PTT\nblocked all calls to the 206 area code. So we issued numbers from different\narea codes. In Saudi Arabia, they disabled touch-tones upon connection so our\nusers were unable to place calls when the callback arrived \u2013 so we instituted\na sophisticated voice recognition system \u2013 customer service reps who listened\nto our customers speaking the number and keyed it into the system.\u201d In Canada,\na bizarre situation developed in which calls from the Yukon and Northwest\nTerritories to the big southeastern cities like Ottawa and Toronto were\nactually cheaper \u2013 by a factor of three \u2013 when routed through Seattle than\nwhen dialed directly. In response to the flood of Kallback traffic, Canada\u2019s\nNorthern Telecom had human operators monitor phone calls, listening for the\ndistinctive pattern of a trigger call: one ring followed by a hang-up. They\nthen blocked calls to those numbers. So ITL substituted a busy signal for the\nringing sound. Northern Telecom, unwilling to block calls to every phone in\nthe US that was ever busy, was checkmated.\n\nIn most countries, callback services inhabit a gray area. Saudi Arabia and\nKenya occasionally run ads reminding their people that callback is illegal,\nbut they don\u2019t try to enforce the law. China has better luck with enforcement\nbecause of its system of informants, but it doesn\u2019t bother Western\nbusinesspeople, who are the primary users. Singapore has legalized them on the\ncondition that they don\u2019t advertise. In Italy, the market is so open that ITL\nis about to market a debit card that enables people to use the service from\nany pay phone.\n\nSo settlement charges have backfired on the telcos of many countries.\nOriginally created to coddle these local monopolies, they\u2019ve now become a\nhazard to their existence.\n\nKDD carries all the baggage of an old monopoly: it works in conjunction with a\nnotoriously gray and moribund government agency, it still has the bad\ncustomer-service attitude that is typical of monopolies, and it has the whole\nrange of monopoly PR troubles too. Any competitive actions that it takes tend\nto be construed as part of a sinister world domination plot. So KDD has\nmanaged to get the worst of both worlds: it is viewed both as a big sinister\nmonopoly and as a cringing sidekick to the even bigger and more sinister AT&T.\n\nMichio Kuroda is a KDD executive who negotiates deals relating to submarine\ncables. He tells of a friend of his, a KDD employee who went to the United\nStates two decades ago to study at a university and went around proudly\nannouncing to his new American acquaintances that he worked for a monopoly.\nFinally, some kind soul took him aside and gently broke the news to him that,\nin America, monopoly was an ugly word.\n\nNow, 20 years later, Kuroda claims that KDD has come around; it agrees now\nthat monopoly is an ugly word. KDD\u2019s detractors will say that this is self-\nserving, but it rings true to this reporter. It seems clear that a decision\nhas been made at the highest levels of KDD that it\u2019s time to stop looking\nbackward and start to compete. As KDD is demonstrating, fat payrolls can be\ntrimmed. Capital can be raised. Customer service can be improved, prices cut,\nbad PR mended. The biggest challenge that KDD faces now may stem from a\nmistake that it made several years ago: it decided not to land FLAG.\n\n35\u00b0 11.535\u2032 N, 139\u00b0 36.995\u2032 EIDC Cable Landing Station, Miura, Japan\n\nThe Miura station of IDC, or International Digital Communications Inc., looks\na good deal like KDD\u2019s Ninomiya station on the inside, except that its\nequipment is made by Fujitsu instead of KDD-SCS. At first approximation, you\nmight think of IDC as being the MCI of Japan. Originally it specialized in\ndata transmission, but now that deregulation has arrived it is also a long-\ndistance carrier. This, by the way, is a common pattern in Asian countries\nwhere deregulation is looming: new companies will try to kick out a niche for\nthemselves in data or cellular markets and hold on by their toenails until the\nvast long-distance market opens up to them. Anyone in Japan can dial an\ninternational call over IDC\u2019s network by dialing the prefix 0061 instead of\n001 for KDD. The numerical prefixes of various competing long-distance\ncompanies are slapped up all over Tokyo on signs and across rear windows of\ntaxicabs in a desperate attempt to get a tiny edge in mindshare.\n\nMiura\u2019s outer surroundings are quite different from Ninomiya\u2019s. Ninomiya is on\na bluff in the middle of a town, and the beach below it is a narrow strip of\nsand chockablock with giant concrete tetrapods, looking like vastly magnified\nskeletons of plankton and intended to keep waves from washing up onto the busy\ncoastal highway that runs between the beach and the station. Miura, by\ncontrast, is a resort area with a wide beach lined with seasonal restaurants.\nWhen we were there we even saw a few surfers, hunting for puny waves under a\nrelentless rain, looking miserable in black wetsuits. The beach gives way to\nintensively cultivated farmland.\n\nMiura is the Japan end of NPC, the Northern Pacific Cable, which links it\ndirectly to Pacific City, Oregon, with 8,380 kilometers of second-generation\noptical fiber (it carries three fiber pairs, each of which handles 420 Mbps).\nMiura also lands APC, the Asia-Pacific Cable, which links it to Hong Kong and\nSingapore, and by means of a short cable under Tokyo Bay it is connected to\nKDD\u2019s Chikura station, which is a major nexus for transpacific and East Asian\ncables.\n\nWhen FLAG first approached KDD with its wild scheme to build a privately\nfinanced cable from England to Japan, there were plenty of reasons for KDD to\nturn it down. The US Commerce Department was pressuring KDD to accept FLAG,\nbut AT&T was against it. KDD was now caught between two sumo wrestlers trying\nto push it opposite ways. Also in the crowded ring was Japan\u2019s\ntelecommunications ministry, which maintained that plenty of bandwidth already\nexisted and that FLAG would somehow create a glut on the market. Again, this\nattitude is probably difficult for the hacker tourist or any other Net user to\ncomprehend, but it seems to be ubiquitous among telecrats.\n\nFinally, KDD saw advantages in the old business model in which cables are\nbacked, and owned, by carriers \u2013 it likes the idea of owning a cable and\nreaping profits from it rather than allowing a bunch of outside investors to\nmake all the money.\n\nFor whatever reasons, KDD declined FLAG\u2019s invitation, so FLAG made overtures\nto IDC, which readily agreed to land the cable at its Miura station, where it\ncould be cross-connected with NPC.\n\nA similar scenario played out in Korea, by the way, where Korea Telecom,\ntraditionally a loyal member of the AT&T family, turned FLAG down at first.\nFLAG approached a competitor named Dacom, and, faced with that threat, Korea\nTelecom changed its mind and decided to break with AT&T and land FLAG after\nall. But in Japan, KDD, perhaps displaying more loyalty than was good for it,\nheld the line. Miura became FLAG\u2019s Japanese landing station by default \u2013 a\nhuge coup for IDC, which could now route calls to virtually anywhere in the\nworld directly from its station.\n\nAll of this happened prior to a major FLAG meeting in Singapore in 1992, which\nthose familiar with the project regard as having been a turning point. At this\nmeeting it became clear that FLAG was a serious endeavor, that it really was\ngoing to happen. Not long afterward, AT&T decided to adopt an \u201cif you can\u2019t\nbeat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u201d strategy toward FLAG, which eventually led to it and KDD\nSubmarine Cable Systems getting the contract to build FLAG\u2019s cable and\nrepeaters. (AT&T-SSI is supplying 64 percent of the cable and 59 percent of\nthe repeaters, and KDD-SCS is supplying the rest.) This was a big piece of\ngood news for KDD-SCS, the competitive-minded manufacturer, but it put KDD the\npoky long-distance company in the awkward, perhaps even absurd situation of\nsupplying the hardware for a project that it had originally opposed and that\nwould end up being a cash cow for its toughest competitor.\n\nSo KDD changed its mind and began trying to get in on FLAG. Since FLAG was\nalready coming ashore at a station owned by IDC, this meant creating a second\nlanding in Japan, at Ninomiya. In no other country would FLAG have two\nlandings controlled by two different companies. For arcane contractual\nreasons, this meant that all of the other 50-odd carriers involved in FLAG\nwould have to give unanimous consent to the arrangement, which meant in\npractice that IDC had veto power. At a ceremony opening a new KDD-SCS factory\non Ky\ufffdush\ufffdu, executives from KDD and IDC met to discuss the idea. IDC agreed\nto let KDD in, in exchange for what people on both sides agree were\nsurprisingly reasonable conditions.\n\nAt first blush it might seem as though IDC was guilty of valuing harmony and\ncooperation over the preservation of shareholder value \u2013 a common charge\nleveled against Japanese corporations by grasping and peevish American\ninvestors. Perhaps there was some element of this, but the fact is that IDC\ndid have good reasons for wanting FLAG connected to KDD\u2019s network. KDD\u2019s\nNinomiya station is scheduled to be the landing site for TPC-5, a megaproject\nof the same order of magnitude as FLAG: 25,000 kilometers of third-generation\noptical fiber cable swinging in a vast loop around the Pacific, connecting\nJapan with the West Coast of the US. With both FLAG and TPC-5 literally coming\ninto the same room at Ninomiya, it would be possible to build a cross-connect\nbetween the two, effectively extending FLAG\u2019s reach across the Pacific. This\nwould add a great deal of value to FLAG and hence would be good for IDC.\n\nIn any case, the deal fell through because of a strong anti-FLAG faction\nwithin KDD that could not tolerate the notion of giving any concessions\nwhatever to IDC. There it stalemated until FLAG managed to cut a deal with\nChina Telecom to run a full-bore 10.6 Gbps spur straight into Shanghai. While\nChina has other undersea cable connections, they are tiny compared with FLAG,\nwhich is now set to be the first big cable, as well as the first modern\nInternet connection, into China.\n\nAt this point it became obvious that KDD absolutely had to get in on the FLAG\naction no matter what the cost, and so it returned to the bargaining table \u2013\nbut this time, IDC, sensing that it had an overpoweringly strong hand, wanted\nmuch tougher conditions. Eventually, though, the deal was made, and now\njumpsuited workers are preparing rooms at both Ninomiya and Miura to receive\nthe new equipment racks, much like expectant parents wallpapering the\nnursery.= At Ninomiya, an immense cross-connect will be built between FLAG and\nTPC-5, and Miura will house a cross-connect between FLAG and the smaller NPC\ncable.\n\nThe two companies will end up on an equal footing as far as FLAG is concerned,\nbut the crucial strategic misstep has already been made by KDD: by letting IDC\nbe the first to land FLAG, it has given its rival a chance to acquire a great\ndeal of experience in the business. It is not unlike the situation that now\nexists between AT&T, which used to be the only company big and experienced\nenough to put together a major international cable, and Nynex, which has now\nmanaged to get its foot in that particular door and is rapidly gaining the\nexperience and contacts needed to compete with AT&T in the future.\n\nHazards\n\nDr. Wildman Whitehouse and his 5-foot-long induction coils were the first\nhazard to destroy a submarine cable but hardly the last. It sometimes seems as\nthough every force of nature, every flaw in the human character, and every\nbiological organism on the planet is engaged in a competition to see which can\nsever the most cables. The Museum of Submarine Telegraphy in Porthcurno,\nEngland, has a display of wrecked cables bracketed to a slab of wood. Each is\nlabeled with its cause of failure, some of which sound dramatic, some cryptic,\nsome both: trawler maul, spewed core, intermittent disconnection, strained\ncore, teredo worms, crab\u2019s nest, perished core, fish bite, even \u201cspliced by\nItalians.\u201d The teredo worm is like a science fiction creature, a bivalve with\na rasp-edged shell that it uses like a buzz saw to cut through wood \u2013 or\nthrough submarine cables. Cable companies learned the hard way, early on, that\nit likes to eat gutta-percha, and subsequent cables received a helical\nwrapping of copper tape to stop it.\n\nA modern cable needn\u2019t be severed to stop working. More frequently, a fault in\nthe insulation will allow seawater to leak in and reach the copper conductor\nthat carries power to the repeaters. The optical fibers are fine, but the\nrepeater stops working because its power is leaking into the ocean. The\ninteraction of electricity, seawater, and other chemical elements present in\nthe cable can produce hydrogen gas that forces its way down the cable and\nchemically attacks the fiber or delicate components in the repeaters.\n\nCable failure can be caused by any number of errors in installation or route\nselection. Currents, such as those found before the mouths of rivers, are\navoided. If the bottom is hard, currents will chafe the cable against it \u2013 and\ncurrents and hard bottoms frequently go together because currents tend to\nscour sediments away from the rock. If the cable is laid with insufficient\nslack, it may become suspended between two ridges, and as the suspended part\nrocks back and forth, the ridges eventually wear through the insulation. Sand\nwaves move across the bottom of the ocean like dunes across the desert; these\ncan surface a cable, where it may be bruised by passing ships. Anchors are a\nperennial problem that gets much worse during typhoons, because an anchor that\nhas dropped well away from a cable may be dragged across it as the ship is\npushed around by the wind.\n\nIn 1870, a new cable was laid between England and France, and Napoleon III\nused it to send a congratulatory message to Queen Victoria. Hours later, a\nFrench fisherman hauled the cable up into his boat, identified it as either\nthe tail of a sea monster or a new species of gold-bearing seaweed, and cut\noff a chunk to take home. Thus was inaugurated an almost incredibly hostile\nrelationship between the cable industry and fishermen. Almost anyone in the\ncable business will be glad, even eager, to tell you that since 1870 the\nintelligence and civic responsibility of fisherman have only degraded.\nFishermen, for their part, tend to see everyone in the cable business as hard-\nhearted bluebloods out to screw the common man.\n\nMost of the fishing-related damage is caused by trawlers, which tow big\nsacklike nets behind them. Trawlers seem designed for the purpose of damaging\nsubmarine cables. Various types of hardware are attached to the nets. In some\ncases, these are otter boards, which act something like rudders to push the\nnet\u2019s mouth open. When bottom fish such as halibut are the target, a massive\nbar is placed across the front of the net with heavy tickler chains dangling\nfrom it; these flail against the bottom, stirring up the fish so they will\nrise up into the maw of the net.\n\nMere impact can be enough to wreck a cable, if it puts a leak in the\ninsulation. Frequently, though, a net or anchor will snag a cable. If the ship\nis small and the cable is big, the cable may survive the encounter. There is a\ntype of cable, used up until the advent of optical fiber, called 21-quad,\nwhich consists of 21 four-bundle pairs of cable and a coaxial line. It is 15\ncentimeters in diameter, and a single meter of it weighs 46 kilograms. If a\npassing ship should happen to catch such a cable with its anchor, it will\nfollow a very simple procedure: abandon it and go buy a new anchor.\n\nBut modern cables are much smaller and lighter \u2013 a mere 0.85 kg per meter for\nthe unarmored, deep-sea portions of the FLAG cable \u2013 and the ships most apt to\nsnag them, trawlers, are getting bigger and more powerful. Now that fishermen\nhave massacred most of the fish in shallower water, they are moving out\ndeeper. Formerly, cable was plowed into the bottom in water shallower than\n1,000 meters, which kept it away from the trawlers. Because of recent changes\nin fishing practices, the figure has been boosted to 2,000 meters. But this\nmeans that the old cables are still vulnerable.\n\nWhen a trawler snags a cable, it will pull it up off the seafloor. How far it\ngets pulled depends on the weight of the cable, the amount of slack, and the\nsize and horsepower of the ship. Even if the cable is not pulled all the way\nto the surface, it may get kinked \u2013 its minimum bending radius may be\nviolated. If the trawler does succeed in hauling the cable all the way up out\nof the water, the only way out of the situation, or at least the simplest, is\nto cut the cable. Dave Handley once did a study of a cable that had been\nsuddenly and mysteriously severed. Hauling up the cut end, he discovered that\nsomeone had sliced through it with a cutting torch.\n\nThere is also the obvious threat of sabotage by a hostile government, but,\nsurprisingly, this almost never happens. When cypherpunk Doug Barnes was\nresearching his Caribbean project, he spent some time looking into this,\nbecause it was exactly the kind of threat he was worried about in the case of\na data haven. Somewhat to his own surprise and relief, he concluded that it\nsimply wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cCutting a submarine cable,\u201d Barnes says, \u201cis\nlike starting a nuclear war. It\u2019s easy to do, the results are devastating, and\nas soon as one country does it, all of the others will retaliate.\n\n\u201cBert Porter, a Cable & Wireless cable-laying veteran who is now a freelancer,\nwas beachmaster for the Tong Fuk lay. He was on a ship that laid a cable from\nHong Kong to Singapore during the late 1960s. Along the way they passed south\nof Lan Tao Island, and so the view from Tong Fuk Beach is a trip down memory\nlane for him. \u201cThe repeater spacing was about 18 miles,\u201d he says, \u201cand so the\nfirst repeater went into the water right out there. Then, a few days later,\nthe cable suddenly tested broken.\u201d In other words, the shore station in Hong\nKong had lost contact with the equipment on board Porter\u2019s cable ship. In such\ncases it\u2019s easy to figure out roughly where the break occurred \u2013 by measuring\nthe resistance in the cable\u2019s conductors \u2013 and they knew it had to be\nsomewhere in the vicinity of the first repeater. \u201cSo we backtracked, pulling\nup cable, and when we got right out there,\u201d he waves his hand out over the\nbay, \u201cwe discovered that the repeater had simply been chopped out.\u201d He holds\nhis hands up parallel, like twin blades. \u201cApparently the Chinese were curious\nabout our repeaters, so they thought they\u2019d come out and get one.\u201d\n\nAs the capacity of optical fibers climbs, so does the economic damage caused\nwhen the cable is severed. FLAG makes its money by selling capacity to long-\ndistance carriers, who turn around and resell it to end users at rates that\nare increasingly determined by what the market will bear. If FLAG gets\nchopped, no calls get through. The carriers\u2019 phone calls get routed to FLAG\u2019s\ncompetitors (other cables or satellites), and FLAG loses the revenue\nrepresented by those calls until the cable is repaired. The amount of revenue\nit loses is a function of how many calls the cable is physically capable of\ncarrying, how close to capacity the cable is running, and what prices the\nmarket will bear for calls on the broken cable segment. In other words, a\nbreak between Dubai and Bombay might cost FLAG more in revenue loss than a\nbreak between Korea and Japan if calls between Dubai and Bombay cost more.\n\nThe rule of thumb for calculating revenue loss works like this: for every\npenny per minute that the long distance market will bear on a particular\nroute, the loss of revenue, should FLAG be severed on that route, is about\n$3,000 a minute. So if calls on that route are a dime a minute, the damage is\n$30,000 a minute, and if calls are a dollar a minute, the damage is almost a\nthird of a million dollars for every minute the cable is down. Upcoming\nadvances in fiber bandwidth may push this figure, for some cables, past the\nmillion-dollar-a-minute mark.\n\nClearly, submarine cable repair is a good business to be in. Cable repair\nships are standing by in ports all over the world, on 24-hour call, waiting\nfor a break to happen somewhere in their neighborhood. They are called\nagreement ships. Sometimes, when nothing else is going on, they will go out\nand pull up old abandoned cables. The stated reason for this is that the old\ncables present a hazard to other ships. However, if you do so much as raise an\neyebrow at this explanation, any cable man will be happy to tell you the real\nreason: whenever a fisherman snags his net on anything \u2013 a rock, a wreck, or\neven a figment of his imagination \u2013 he will go out and sue whatever company\nhappens to have a cable in that general vicinity. The cable companies are\nwaiting eagerly for the day when a fisherman goes into court claiming to have\nsnagged his nets on a cable, only to be informed that the cable was pulled up\nby an agreement ship years before.\n\nIn which the Hacker Tourist delights in Cairo, the Mother of the World.\nAlexandria, the former Hacker Headquarters of the planet.\n\nThe lighthouse, the libraries, and other haunts of ancient nerds and geeks.\nProfound significanceof intersections.

Next stop:\nEgypt.\n\nNo visit to Egypt is complete without a stop in Cairo, but that city, the\npinnacle of every normal tourist\u2019s traveling career, is strangely empty from a\nhacker tourist point of view. Its prime attraction, of course, is the\npyramids. We visited them at five in the morning during a long and ultimately\nfutile wait for the Egyptian military to give us permission to rendezvous with\nFLAG\u2019s cable-laying ship in the Gulf of Suez. To the hacker, the most\ninteresting thing about the Pyramids is their business plan, which is the\nsimplest and most effective ever devised:\n\n(1) Put a rock on top of another rock. (2) Repeat (1) until gawkers arrive.\n(3) Separate them from their valuables by all conceivable means.\n\nBy contrast, normal tourist guidebooks have nothing good to say about\nAlexandria; it\u2019s as if the writers got so tired of marveling at Cairo and\nUpper Egypt that they had to vent their spleen somewhere. Though a town was\nhere in ancient times, Alexandria per se was founded in 332 BC by Alexander\nthe Great, which makes it a brand-new city by Egyptian standards. There is\nalmost no really old stuff in Alexandria at all, but the mere memory of the\nlandmarks that were here in its heyday suffice to make it much more important\nthan Cairo from the weirdly distorted viewpoint of the hacker tourist. These\nlandmarks are, or were, the lighthouse and the libraries.\n\nThe lighthouse was built on the nearby island of Pharos. Neither the building\nnor even the island exists any more. Pharos was eventually joined to the\nmainland by a causeway, which fattened out into a peninsula and became a\nminuscule bump on the scalp of Africa. The lighthouse was an immense\nstructure, at some 120 meters the tallest building in the world for many\ncenturies, and contained as many as 300 rooms. Somewhere in its upper stories\na fire burned all night long, and its light was reflected out across the\nMediterranean by some kind of rotating mirror or prism. This was a fine bit of\nancient hacking in and of itself, but according to legend, the optics also had\nmagnifying properties, so that observers peering through it during the daytime\ncould see ships too distant to be perceived by the naked eye.\n\nAccording to legend, this feature made Alexandria immune to naval assault as\nlong as the lighthouse remained standing. According to another yarn, a\nByzantine emperor spread a rumor that the treasure of Alexander the Great had\nbeen hidden within the lighthouse\u2019s foundation, and the unbelievably fatuous\nlocal caliph tore up the works looking for it, putting Pharos out of\ncommission and leading to a military defeat by the Byzantine Empire.\n\nSome combination or other of gullible caliphs, poor maintenance, and\nearthquakes eventually did fell the lighthouse. Evidently it toppled right\ninto the Mediterranean. The bottom of the sea directly before its foundations\nis still littered with priceless artifacts, which are being catalogued and\nhauled out by French archaeologists using differential GPS to plot their\nfindings. They work in the shadow of a nondescript fortress built on the site\nby a later sultan, Qait Bey, who pragmatically used a few chunks of lighthouse\ngranite to beef up the walls \u2013 just another splinter under the fingernails of\nthe historical preservation crowd.\n\nYou can go to the fortress of Qait Bey now and stare out over the ocean and\nget much the same view that the builders of the lighthouse enjoyed. They must\nhave been able to see all kinds of weirdness coming over the horizon from\nEurope and western Asia. The Mediterranean may look small on a world map, but\nfrom Pharos its horizon seems just as infinite as the Pacific seen from Miura.\nBack then, knowing how much of the human world was around the Mediterranean,\nthe horizon must have seemed that much more vast, threatening, and exciting to\nthe Alexandrians.\n\nBuilding the lighthouse with its magic lens was a way of enhancing the city\u2019s\nnatural capability for looking to the north, which made it into a world\ncapital for many centuries. It\u2019s when a society plunders its ability to look\nover the horizon and into the future in order to get short-term gain \u2013\nsometimes illusory gain \u2013 that it begins a long slide nearly impossible to\nreverse.\n\nThe collapse of the lighthouse must have been astonishing, like watching the\nWorld Trade Center fall over. But it took only a few seconds, and if you were\nlooking the other way when it happened, you might have missed it entirely \u2013\nyou\u2019d see nothing but blue breakers rolling in from the Mediterranean, hiding\na field of ruins, quickly forgotten.\n\n31\u00b0 11.738\u2032 N, 29\u00b0 54.108\u2032 EIntersection of El Horreya and El Nabi Daniel,\nAlexandria, Egypt\n\nAlexandria is most famous for having been the site of the ancient library.\nThis was actually two or more different libraries. The first one dates back to\nthe city\u2019s early Ptolemaic rulers, who were Macedonians, not Egyptians. It was\nmodeled after the Lyceum of Aristotle, who, between other gigs, tutored\nAlexander the Great. Back in the days when people moved to information,\ninstead of vice versa, this library attracted most of the most famous smart\npeople in the world: the ultimate hacker, Archimedes; the father of geometry,\nEuclid; Eratosthenes, who was the first person to calculate the circumference\nof the earth, by looking at the way the sun shone down wells at Alexandria and\nAswan. He also ran the library for a while and took the job seriously enough\nthat when he started to go blind in his old age, he starved himself to death.\nIn any event, this library was burned out by the Romans when they were adding\nEgypt to their empire. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s inherently difficult to get\nreliable information about an event that consisted of the destruction of all\nrecorded information.\n\nThe second library was called the Library of Cleopatra and was built around a\ncouple of hundred thousand manuscripts that were given to her by Marc Antony\nin what was either a magnificent gesture of romantic love or a shrewd\npolitical maneuver. Marc Antony suffered from what we would today call \u201cpoor\nimpulse control,\u201d so the former explanation is more likely. This library was\nwiped out by Christians in AD 391. Depending on which version of events you\nread, its life span may have overlapped with that of the first library for a\nfew years, a few decades, or not at all.\n\nWhether or not the two libraries ever existed at the same time, the fact\nremains that between about 300 BC and AD 400, Alexandria was by far the world\ncapital of high-quality information. It must have had much in common with the\nMIT campus or Stanford in Palo Alto of more recent times: lots of hairy smart\nguys converging from all over the world to tinker with the lighthouse or to\nengage in pursuits that must have been totally incomprehensible to the locals,\nsuch as staring down wells at high noon and raving about the diameter of the\nearth.\n\nThe main reason that writers of tourist guidebooks are so cheesed off at\nAlexandria is that no vestige of the first library remains \u2013 not even a plaque\nstating \u201cThe Library of Alexandria was here.\u201d If you want to visit the site,\nyou have to do a bit of straightforward detective work. Ancient Alexandria was\nlaid out on a neat, regular grid pattern \u2013 just the kind of thing you would\nexpect of a place populated by people like Euclid. The main east-west street\nwas called the Canopic Way, and the main north-south street, running from the\nwaterfront toward the Sahara Desert, was called the Street of the Soma. The\nlibrary is thought to have stood just south of their intersection.\n\nThough no buildings of that era remain, the streets still do, and so does\ntheir intersection. Currently, the Canopic Way is called El Horreya Avenue,\nand the Soma is called El Nabi Daniel Street, though if you don\u2019t hurry, they\nmay be called something else when you arrive.\n\nWe stayed at the Cecil Hotel, where Nabi Daniel hits the waterfront. The Cecil\nis one of those British imperial-era hotels fraught with romance and history,\nsort of like the entire J. Peterman catalog rolled into one building. British\nIntelligence was headquartered there during the war, and there the Battle of\nEl Alamein was planned.\n\nLiving as they do, however, in a country choked with old stuff, the Egyptians\nhave adopted a philosophy toward architecture that is best summed up by the\nphrase: \u201cWhat have you done for me lately?\u201d From this point of view, the Cecil\nis just another old building, and it\u2019s not even particularly old. As if to\nemphasize this, the side of the hotel where we stayed was covered with a rude\nscaffolding (sticks lashed together with hemp) aswarm with workers armed with\nsledgehammers, crowbars, chisels, and the like, who spent all day, every day,\nbellowing cheerfully at each other (demolition workers are the jolliest men in\nevery country), bashing huge chunks of masonry off the top floor and simply\ndropping them \u2013 occasionally crushing an air conditioner on some guest\u2019s\nbalcony. It was a useful reminder that Egyptians feel no great compulsion to\ntailor their cities to the specifications of guidebook writers.\n\nThis fact can be further driven home by walking south on Nabi Daniel and\nlooking for the site of the Library of Alexandria. It is now occupied by\noffice buildings probably not more than 100, nor less than 50, years old.\nTheir openings are covered with roll-up steel doors, and their walls decorated\nwith faded signs. One of them advertises courses in DOS, Lotus, dBase, COBOL,\nand others. Not far away is a movie theater showing Forbidden Arsenal: In the\nLine of Duty 6, starring Cynthia Khan.\n\nThe largest and nicest building in the area is used by an insurance company\nand surrounded by an iron fence. The narrow sidewalk out front is blocked by a\nfew street vendors who have set up their wares in such a way as to force\npedestrians out into the street. One of them is selling pictures of adorable\nkittens tangled up in yarn, and another is peddling used books. This is the\nclosest thing to a library that remains here, so I spent a while examining his\nwares: a promising volume called Bit by Bit turned out to be an English\nprimer. There were quite a few medical textbooks, as if a doctor had just\npassed away, and Agatha Christie and Mickey Mouse books presumably left behind\nby tourists. The closest thing I saw to a classic was a worn-out copy of\nOliver Twist.\n\n31\u00b0 10.916\u2032 N29\u00b0 53.784\u2032 EPompey\u2019s Pillar\n\nThe site of Cleopatra\u2019s library, precisely 1 mile away by my GPS, is viewed\nwith cautious approval by guidebook writers because it is an actual ruin with\na wall around it, a ticket booth, old stuff, and guides. It is right next to\nan active Muslim cemetery, so it is difficult to reach the place without\nexcusing your way past crowds of women in voluminous black garments, wailing\nand sobbing heartrendingly, which all goes to make the Western tourist feel\nlike even more of a penis than usual.\n\nThe site used to be the city\u2019s acropolis. It is a rounded hill of extremely\nmodest altitude with a huge granite pillar on the top. To quote Shelley\u2019s\n\u201cOzymandias\u201d: \u201cNothing beside remains.\u201d A few sphinxes are scattered around\nthe place, but they were obviously dragged in to give tourists something to\nlook at. Several brutally impoverished gray concrete apartment buildings loom\nup on the other side of the wall, festooned with washing, crammed with\nchildren who entertain themselves by raining catcalls down upon the few\ntourists who straggle out this far. The granite pillar honors the Roman\nemperor Diocletian, who was a very bad emperor, a major Christian-killer, but\nwho gave Alexandria a big tax break. The citizenry, apparently just as\ndimwitted as modern day Americans, decided that he was a great guy and erected\nthis pillar. Originally there was a statue of Diocletian himself on the top,\nriding a horse, which is why the Egyptians call it, in Arabic, The man on\nhorseback. The statue is gone now, which makes this a completely mystifying\nname. Westerners call it Pompey\u2019s Pillar because that\u2019s the moniker the\nclueless Crusaders slapped on it; of course, it has absolutely nothing to do\nwith Pompey.\n\nThe hacker tourist does not bother with the pillar but rather with what is\nunderneath it: a network of artificial caves, carved into the sandstone,\nresembling nothing so much as a D & D player\u2019s first dungeon. Because it\u2019s a\nhill and this is Egypt, the caverns are nice and dry and (with a little\nbaksheesh in the right hands) can be well lit too \u2013 electrical conduit has\nbeen run in and light fixtures bolted to the ceiling. The walls of these caves\nhave niches that are just the right size and shape to contain piles of\nscrolls, so this is thought to be the site of the Library of Cleopatra. This\ncomplex was called the Sarapeum, or Temple of Sarapis, who was a conflation of\nOsiris and Apis admired by the locals and loathed by monotheists, which\nexplains why the whole complex was sacked and burned by Christians in 391.\n\nIt is all rather discouraging, when you use your imagination (which you must\ndo constantly in Alexandria) and think of the brilliance that was here for a\nwhile. As convenient as it is for information to come to us, libraries do have\na valuable side effect: they force all of the smart people to come together in\none place where they can interact with one another. When the information goes\nup in flames, those people go their separate ways. The synergy that joined\nthem \u2013 that created the lighthouse, for example \u2013 dies. The world loses\nsomething.\n\nSo the second library is some holes in a wall, and the first is an\nintersection. Holes and intersections are both absences, empty places,\ndisappointing to tourists of both the regular and the hacker variety. But one\ncan argue that the intersection\u2019s continued presence is arguably more\ninteresting than some old pile that has been walled off and embalmed by a\nhistorical society. How can an intersection remain in one place for 2,500\nyears? Simply, both the roads that run through it must remain open and active.\nThe intersection will cease to exist if sand drifts across it because it\u2019s\nnever used, or if someone puts up a building there. In Egypt, where\nyesterday\u2019s wonders of the world are today\u2019s building materials, nothing is\nmore obvious than that people have been avidly putting up buildings everywhere\nthey possibly can for 5,000 years, so it is remarkable that no such thing has\nhappened here. It means that every time some opportunist has gone out and\ntried to dig up the street or to start putting up a wall, he has been\nflattened by traffic, arrested by cops, chased away by outraged donkey-cart\ndrivers, or otherwise put out of action. The existence of this intersection is\nproof that a certain pattern of human activity has endured in this exact place\nfor 2,500 years.\n\nWhen the hacker tourist has tired of contemplating the profound significance\nof intersections (which, frankly, doesn\u2019t take very long) he must turn his\nattention to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 cable routes. This turns out to be a much\nricher vein.\n\n30\u00b0 58.319\u2032 N, 29\u00b0 49.531\u2032 EAlexandria Tollbooth, the Desert Road, Sahara\nDesert, Egypt\n\nAs we speed across the Saharan night, the topic of conversation turns to Hong\nKong. Our Egyptian driver, relaxed and content after stopping at a roadside\nrest area for a hubbly-bubbly session (smoking sweetened tobacco in a Middle\nEastern bong), smacks the steering wheel gleefully. \u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d he roars.\n\u201cMiserable Hong Kong people!\u201d\n\nAlexandria and Cairo are joined by two separate, roughly parallel highways\ncalled the Desert Road and the Agricultural Road. The latter runs through\ncultivated parts of the Nile Delta. The Desert Road is a rather new, four-lane\nhighway with a tollbooth at each end \u2013 tollbooths in the middle not being\nnecessary, because if you get off in the middle you will die. It is lined for\nits entire length with billboards advertising tires, sunglasses, tires, tires,\ntires, bottled water, sunglasses, tires, and tires.\n\nPerhaps because it is supported by tolls, the Desert Highway is a first-rate\nroad all the way. This means not merely that the pavement is good but also\nthat it has a system of ducts and manholes buried under its median strip, so\nthat anyone wishing to run a cable from one end of the highway to the other \u2013\ntollbooth to tollbooth \u2013 need only obtain a \u201cpermit\u201d and ream out the ducts a\nlittle. Or at least that\u2019s what the Egyptians say. The Lan Tao Island crowd,\nwho are quite discriminating when it comes to ducts and who share an\nabhorrence of all things Egyptian, claim that cheap PVC pipe was used and that\nthe whole system is a tangled mess.\n\nThey would both agree, however, that beyond the tollbooths the duct situation\nis worse. The Alexandria Tollbooth is some 37 kilometers outside of the city\ncenter; you get there by driving along a free highway that has no ducts at\nall.\n\nThis problem is being remedied by FLAG, which has struck a deal with ARENTO\n(Arab Republic of Egypt National Telecommunications Organization \u2013 the PTT)\nthat is roughly analogous to the one it made with the Communications Authority\nof Thailand. FLAG has no choice but to go overland across Egypt, just as in\nThailand. The reasons for doing so here are entirely different, though.\n\nBy a freak of geography and global politics, Egypt possesses the same sort of\nchoke point on Europe-to-Asia telecommunications as the Suez canal gives it in\nthe shipping industry. Anyone who wants to run a cable from Europe to East\nAsia has severely limited choices. You can go south around Africa, but it\u2019s\nmuch too far. You can go overland across all of Russia, as U S West has\nrecently talked about doing, but if even a 170-kilometers terrestrial route\nacross Thailand gets your customers fumbling for their smelling salts, what\nwill they say about one all the way across Russia? You could attempt a shorter\nterrestrial route from the Levant to the Indian Ocean, but given the countries\nit would have to pass through (Lebanon and Iraq, to name two), it would have\nabout as much chance of survival as a strand of gossamer stretched across a\nkick-boxing ring. And you can\u2019t lay a cable down the Suez Canal, partly\nbecause it would catch hell from anchors and dredgers, and partly because\ncable-laying ships move very slowly and would create an enormous traffic jam.\n\nThe only solution that is even remotely acceptable is to land the cable on\nEgypt\u2019s Mediterranean coast (which in practice means either Alexandria or Port\nSaid) and then go overland to Suez, where the canal joins the Gulf of Suez,\nwhich in turn joins the Red Sea. The Red Sea is so shallow and so heavily\ntrafficked, by the way, that all cables running through it must be plowed into\nthe seafloor, which is a hassle, but obviously preferable to running a\nterrestrial route through the likes of Sudan and Somalia, which border it.\n\nIn keeping with its practice of running two parallel routes on terrestrial\nsections, FLAG is landing at both Alexandria and Port Said. From these cities\nthe cables converge on Suez. Alexandria is far more important than Port Said\nas a cable nexus for the simple reason that it is at the westernmost extreme\nof the Nile Delta, so you can reach it from Europe without having to contend\nwith the Nile. European cables running to Port Said, by contrast, must pass\nacross the mouths of the Nile, where they are subjected to currents.\n\nEngineer Mustafa Musalam, general manager of transmission for ARENTO\u2019s\nAlexandria office, is a stocky, affable, silver-haired gent. Egypt is one of\nthose places where Engineer is used as a title, like Doctor or Professor, and\nEngineer Musalam bears the title well. In his personality and bearing he has\nat least as much in common with other highly competent engineers around the\nworld as he does with other Egyptians. In defiance of ARENTO rules, he drives\nhimself around in his own vehicle, a tiny, beat-up, but perfectly functional\nsubcompact. An engineer of his stature is supposed to be chauffeured around in\na company car. Most Egyptian service-industry professionals are masters at\nlaying passive-aggressive head trips on their employers. Half the time, when\nyou compensate them, they make it clear that you have embarrassed them, and\nyourself, by grossly overdoing it \u2013 you have just gotten it totally wrong,\nreally pissed down your leg, and placed them in a terribly awkward situation.\nThe other half of the time, you have insulted them by being miserly. You never\nget it right. But Engineer Musalam, a logical and practical-minded sort,\ncannot abide the idea of a driver spending his entire day, every day, sitting\nin a car waiting for the boss to go somewhere. So he eventually threw up his\nhands and unleashed his driver on the job market.\n\nCharitably, Engineer Musalam takes the view that the completion of the Asw\ufffdan\nHigh Dam tamed the Nile\u2019s current to the point where no one need worry about\nrunning cables to Port Said anymore. FLAG\u2019s surveyors obviously agree with\nhim, because they chose Port Said as one of their landing points. On the other\nhand, FLAG\u2019s archenemy, SEA-ME-WE 3, will land only at Alexandria, because\nFrance Telecom\u2019s engineers refuse to lay cable across the Nile. SEA-ME-WE 3\u2019s\nredundant routes will run, instead, along the Desert Road and the Agricultural\nRoad. Bandwidth buyers trying to choose between the two cables can presumably\nlook forward to lurid sales presentations from FLAG marketers detailing the\ninsane recklessness of SEA-ME-WE 3\u2019s approach, and vice versa.\n\nAt the dirt-and-duct level, the operation in Egypt is much like the one in\nThailand. The work is being done by Consolidated Contractors, which is a\nfairly interesting multinational contracting firm that is based and funded in\nthe Middle East but works all over the globe. Here it is laying six 100-mm\nducts (10 inside Alexandria proper) as compared with only two in Thailand.\nThese ducts are all PVC pipe, but FLAG\u2019s duct is made of a higher grade of PVC\nthan the others \u2013 even than President Mubarak\u2019s duct.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 in a nicely Pharaonic touch, one of the six ducts going into\nthe ground here is the sole property of President Hosni Mubarak, or\n(presumably) whoever succeeds him as head of state. It is hard to envision why\na head of state would want or need his own private tube full of air running\nunderneath the Sahara. The obvious guess is that the duct might be used to\ncreate a secure communications system, independent of the civilian and\nmilitary systems (the Egyptian military will own one of the six ducts, and\nARENTO will own three). This, in and of itself, says something about the\nrelationship between the military and the government in Egypt. It is hardly\nsurprising when you consider that Mubarak\u2019s predecessor was murdered by the\nmilitary during a parade.\n\nInside the city, where ten rather than six ducts are being prepared, they must\noccasionally sprout up out of the ground and run along the undersides of\nbridges and flyovers. In these sections it is easy to identify FLAG\u2019s duct\nbecause, unlike the others, it is galvanized steel instead of PVC. FLAG\nundoubtedly specified steel for its far greater protective value, but in so\ndoing posed a challenge for Engineer Musalam, who knew that thieves would\nattack the system wherever they could reach it \u2013 not to take the cable but to\nget their hands on that tempting steel pipe. So, wherever the undersides of\nthese bridges and flyovers are within 2 or 3 meters of ground level, Engineer\nMusalam has built in special measures to make it virtually impossible for\nthieves to get their hands on FLAG\u2019s pipe.\n\nFor the most part, the duct installation is a simple cut-and-cover operation,\nright down the median strip. But the median is crossed frequently by nicely\npaved, heavily trafficked U-turn routes. To cut or block one of these would be\nunthinkable, since no journey in Egypt is complete without numerous U-turns.\nIt is therefore necessary to bore a horizontal tunnel under each one, run a\n600-mm steel pipe down the tunnel, and finally thread the ducts through it.\nThe tunnels are bored by laborers operating big manually powered augers. Under\na sign reading Civil Works: Fiberoptic Link around the Globe, the men had left\ntheir street clothes carefully wrapped up in plastic bags, on the shoulder of\nthe road. They had kicked off their shoes and changed into the traditional,\nloose, ankle-length garment. One by one, they disappeared into a tunnel barely\nbig enough to lie down in, carrying empty baskets, then returned a few minutes\nlater with baskets full of dirt, looking like extras in some new Hollywood\ncostume drama: The Ten Commandments Meets the Great Escape.\n\nWe blundered across Engineer Musalam\u2019s path one afternoon. This was sheer\nluck, but also kind of inevitable: other than ditch diggers, the only people\nin the median strip of this highway are hacker tourists and ARENTO engineers.\nHe was here because one of the crews working on FLAG had, while enlarging a\nmanhole excavation, plunged the blade of their backhoe right through the main\ncommunications cable connecting Egypt to Libya \u2013 a 960-circuit coaxial line\nburied, sans conduit, in the same median. Libya had dropped off the net for a\nwhile until Mu\u2019ammar Gadhafi\u2019s eastbound traffic could be shunted to a\nmicrowave relay chain and an ARENTO repair crew had been mobilized. The\nquality of such an operation is not measured by how frequently cables get\nbroken (usually they are broken by other people) but by how quickly they get\nfixed afterward, and by this standard Engineer Musalam runs a tight ship. The\nmishap occurred on a Friday afternoon \u2013 the Muslim sabbath \u2013 the first day of\na three-day weekend and a national holiday to boot \u2013 40 years to the day after\nthe Suez Canal was handed over to Egypt. Nevertheless, the entire hierarchy\nwas gathered around the manhole excavation, from ditch diggers hastily\nimported from another nearby site all the way up to Engineer Musalam.\n\nThe ditch diggers made the hole even larger, whittling out a place for one of\nthe splicing technicians to sit. The technicians stood on the brink of the pit\noffering directions, and eventually they jumped into it and grabbed shovels;\ntheir toolboxes were lowered in after them on ropes, and their black dress\ntrousers and crisp white shirts rapidly converged on the same color as the\ndust covered them. In the lee of an unburied concrete manhole nearby, a couple\nof men established a little refreshment center: one hubbly-bubbly and one\nportable stove, shooting flames like a miniature oil well fire, where they\ncranked out glass after glass of heavily sweetened tea. This struck me as more\nefficient than the American technique of sending a gofer down to the 7-Eleven\nfor a brace of Super Big Gulps. Traffic swirled around the adjacent U-turn;\nmotorists rolled their windows down and asked for directions, which were\ncheerfully given. Egyptian males are not afraid to hold hands with each other\nor to ask for directions, which does not mean that they should be confused\nwith sensitive New Age males.\n\nThe mangled ends of the cable were cleanly hacksawed and stripped, and a\n2-meter-long segment of the same type of cable was wrestled out of a car and\nbrought into the pit. Two lengths of lead pipe were threaded onto it, later to\nserve as protective bandages for the splices, and then the splicing began, one\nconductor at a time. Engineer Musalam watched attentively while I badgered him\nwith nerdy questions.He brought me up to speed on the latest submarine cable\ngossip. During the previous month, in mid-June, SEA-ME-WE 2 had been cut twice\nbetween Djibouti and India. Two cable ships, Restorer and Enterprise, had been\nsent to fix the breaks. But fire had broken out in the engine room of the\nEnterprise (maybe a problem with the dilithium crystals), putting it into\nrepairs for four weeks. So Restorer had to fix both breaks. But because of bad\nweather, only one of the faults had been repaired as of July 26. In the\nmeantime, all of SEA-ME-WE 2\u2019s traffic had been shunted to a satellite link\nreserved as a backup.\n\nSatellite links have enough bandwidth to fill in for a second-generation\noptical cable like SEA-ME-WE 2 but not enough to replace a third-generation\none like FLAG or SEA-ME-WE 3. The cable industry is therefore venturing into\nnew and somewhat unexplored territory with the current generation of cables.\nIt is out of the question to run such a system without having elaborate backup\nplans, and if satellites can\u2019t hack it anymore, the only possible backup is on\nanother cable \u2013 almost by definition, a competing cable. So as intensely as\nrival companies may compete with each other for customers, they are probably\ncooperating at the same time by reserving capacity on each other\u2019s systems.\nThis presumably accounts for the fact that they are eager to spread nasty\ninformation about each other but will never do so on the record.\n\nI didn\u2019t know the exact route of SEA-ME-WE 3 and was intrigued to learn that\nit will be passing through the same building in Alexandria as SEA-ME-WE 1 and\n2, which is also the same building that will be used by FLAG. In addition,\nthere is a new submarine cable called Africa 1 that is going to completely\nencircle that continent, it being much easier to circumnavigate Africa with a\ncable-laying ship than to run ducts and cables across it (though I would like\nto see Alan Wall have a go at it). Africa 1 will also pass through Engineer\nMusalam\u2019s building in Alexandria, which will therefore serve as the cross-\nconnect among essentially all the traffic of Africa, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThough Engineer Musalam is not the type who would come out and say it, the\nfact is that in a couple of years he\u2019s going to be running what is arguably\nthe most important information nexus on the planet.\n\nAs the sun dropped behind the western Sahara (I imagined Mu\u2019ammar Gadhafi out\nthere somewhere, picking up his telephone to hear a fast busy signal),\nEngineer Musalam drove me into Alexandria in his humble subcompact to see this\nplanetary nexus.\n\nIt is an immense neoclassical pile constructed in 1933 by the British to house\ntheir PTT operations. Since then, it has changed very little except for the\naddition of a window air conditioner in Engineer Musalam\u2019s office. The\nbuilding faces Alexandria\u2019s railway station across an asphalt square crowded\nwith cars, trucks, donkey carts, and pedestrians.\n\nI do not think any other hacker tourist will ever make it inside this\nbuilding. If you do so much as raise a camera to your face in its vicinity, an\nangry man in a uniform will charge up to you and let you get a very good look\nat the bayonet fixed to the end of his automatic weapon. So let me try to\nconvey what it is like:\n\nThe adjective Blade-Runneresque means much to those who have seen the movie.\n(For those who haven\u2019t, just keep reading.) I will, however, never again be\nable to watch Blade Runner, because all of the buildings that looked so cool,\nso exquisitely art-directed in the movie, will now, to me, look like feeble\nefforts to capture a few traces of ARENTO\u2019s Alexandria station at night.\n\nThe building is a titanic structure that goes completely dark at night and\nbecomes a maze of black corridors that appear to stretch on into infinity.\nSome illumination, and a great deal of generalized din, sifts in from the\nnearby square through broken windows. It has received very limited maintenance\nin the last half-century but will probably stand as long as the Pyramids. The\nurinals alone look like something out of Luxor. The building\u2019s cavernous\nstairwells consist of profoundly worn white marble steps winding around a\ncentral shaft that is occupied by an old-fashioned wrought-iron elevator with\nall of the guts exposed: rails, cables, counterweights, and so on. Litter and\ndebris have accumulated at the bottom of these pits. At the top, nocturnal\nbirds have found their way in through open or broken windows and now tear\naround in the blackness like Stealth fighters, hunting for insects and making\neerie keening noises \u2013 not the twitter of songbirds but the alien screech of\nmovie pterodactyls. Gaunt cats prowl soundlessly up and down the stairs. A big\nmicrowave relay tower has been planted on the roof, and the red aircraft\nwarning lights hang in the sky like fat planets. They shed a vague\nillumination back into the building, casting faint cyan shadows. Looking into\nthe building\u2019s courtyards you may see, for a moment, a human figure\nsilhouetted in a doorway by blue fluorescent light. A chair sits next to a\ndust-fogged window that has been cracked open to let in cool night air. Down\nin the square, people are buying and selling, young men strolling hand in hand\nthrough a shambolic market scene. In the windows of apartment buildings across\nthe street, women sit in their colorful but demure garments holding tumblers\nof sweet tea.\n\nIn the midst of all this, then, you walk through a door into a vast room, and\nthere it is: the cable station, rack after rack after rack of gleaming Alcatel\nand Siemens equipment, black phone handsets for the order wires, labeled\nPalermo and Tripoli and Cairo. Taped to a pillar is an Arabic prayer and faded\nphotograph of the faithful circling the Ka\u2019aba. The equipment here is of a\nslightly older vintage than what we saw in Japan, but only because the cables\nare older; when FLAG and SEA-ME-WE 3 and Africa 1 come through, Engineer\nMusalam will have one of the building\u2019s numerous unused rooms scrubbed out and\nfilled with state-of-the-art gear.\n\nA few engineers pad through the place. The setup is instantly recognizable;\nyou can see the same thing anywhere nerds are performing the kinds of\ntechnical hacks that keep modern governments alive. The Manhattan Project,\nBletchley Park, the National Security Agency, and, I would guess, Saddam\nHussein\u2019s weapons labs are all built on the same plan: a big space ringed by\nanxious, ignorant, heavily armed men, looking outward. Inside that perimeter,\na surprisingly small number of hackers wander around through untidy offices\nmaking the world run.\n\nIf you turn your back on the equipment through which the world\u2019s bits are\nswirling, open one of the windows, wind up, and throw a stone pretty hard, you\ncan just about bonk that used book peddler on the head. Because this place,\nsoon to be the most important data nexus on the planet, happens to be\nconstructed virtually on top of the ruins of the Great Library of Alexandria.\n\nThe Lalla Rookh\n\nWhen William Thomson became Lord Kelvin and entered the second phase of his\nlife \u2013 tooling around on his yacht, the Lalla Rookh \u2013 he appeared to lose\ninterest in telegraphy and got sidetracked into topics that, on first reading,\nseem unrelated to his earlier interests \u2013 disappointingly mundane. One of\nthese was depth sounding, and the other was the nautical compass.\n\nAt the time, depths were sounded by heaving a lead-weighted rope over the side\nof the ship and letting it pay out until it hit bottom. So far, so easy, but\nhauling thousands of meters of soggy rope, plus a lead weight, back onto the\nship required the efforts of several sailors and took a long time. The US Navy\nameliorated the problem by rigging it so that the weight could be detached and\nsimply discarded on the bottom, but this only replaced one problem with\nanother one in that a separate weight had to be carried for each sounding.\nEither way, the job was a mess and could be done only rarely. This probably\nexplains why ships were constantly running aground in those days, leading to a\nrelentless, ongoing massacre of crew and passengers compared to which today\u2019s\nproblem of bombs and airliners is like a Sunday stroll through Disney World.\n\nIn keeping with his general practice of using subtlety where moronic brute\nforce had failed, Kelvin replaced the soggy rope with a piano wire, which in\nturn enabled him to replace the heavy weight with a much smaller one. This\nidea might seem obvious to us now, but it was apparently quite the brainstorm.\nThe tension in the wire was so light that a single sailor could reel it in by\nturning a spoked wooden wheel.\n\nThe first time Kelvin tried this, the wheel began to groan after a while and\nfinally imploded. Dental hygienists, or people who floss the way they do\n(using extravagantly long pieces of floss and wrapping the used part around a\nfingertip) will already know why. The first turn of floss exerts only light\npressure on the finger, but the second turn doubles it, and so on, until, as\nyou are coming to the end of the process, your fingertip has turned a\ngangrenous purple. In the same way, the tension on Kelvin\u2019s piano wire, though\nsmall enough to be managed by one man, became enormous after a few hundred\nturns. No reasonable wheel could endure such stress.\n\nChagrined and embarrassed, Kelvin invented a stress-relief mechanism. On one\nside of it the wire was tight, on the other side it was slack and could be\ntaken up by the wheel without compressing the hub. Once this was out of the\nway, the challenge became how to translate the length of piano wire that had\nbeen paid out into an accurate depth reading. One could never assume that the\nwire ran straight down to the bottom. Usually the vessel was moving, so the\nlead weight would trail behind it. Furthermore, a line stretched between two\npoints in this way forms a curve known to mathematicians as a catenary, and of\ncourse the curve is longer than a straight line between the same two points.\nKelvin had to figure out what sorts of catenary curves his piano wire would\nassume under various conditions of vessel speed and ocean depth \u2013 an\nessentially tedious problem that seems well beneath the abilities of the\nfather of thermodynamics.\n\nIn any case, he figured it out and patented everything. Once again he made a\nton of money. At the same time, he revolutionized the field of bathymetry and\nprobably saved a large number of lives by making it easier for mariners to\ntake frequent depth soundings. At the same time, he invented a vastly improved\nform of ship\u2019s compass which was as big an improvement over the older models\nas his depth-sounding equipment was over the soggy rope. Attentive readers\nwill not be surprised to learn that he patented this device and made a ton of\nmoney from it.\n\nKelvin had revolutionized the art of finding one\u2019s way on the ocean, both in\nthe vertical (depth) dimension and in the horizontal (compass) dimensions. He\nhad made several fortunes in the process and spent a great deal of his\nintellectual gifts on pursuits that, I thought at first, could hardly have\nbeen less relevant to his earlier work on undersea cables. But that was my\nproblem, not his. I didn\u2019t figure out what he was up to until very close to\nthe ragged end of my hacker tourism binge\n\nSlack\n\nThe first time a cable-savvy person uses the word slack in your presence,\nyou\u2019ll be tempted to assume he is using it in the loose, figurative way \u2013 as a\nlayperson uses it. After the eightieth or ninetieth time, and after the cable\nguy has spent a while talking about the seemingly paradoxical notion of slack\ncontrol and extolling the sophistication of his ship\u2019s slack control systems\nand his computer\u2019s slack numerical-simulation software, you begin to\nunderstand that slack plays as pivotal a role in a cable lay as, say, thrust\ndoes in a moon mission.\n\nHe who masters slack in all of its fiendish complexity stands astride the\ncable world like a colossus; he who is clueless about slack either snaps his\ncable in the middle of the ocean or piles it in a snarl on the ocean floor \u2013\nwhich is precisely what early 19th-century cable layers spent most of their\ntime doing.\n\nThe basic problem of slack is akin to a famous question underlying the\nmathematical field of fractals: How long is the coastline of Great Britain? If\nI take a wall map of the isle and measure it with a ruler and multiply by the\nmap\u2019s scale, I\u2019ll get one figure. If I do the same thing using a set of large-\nscale ordnance survey maps, I\u2019ll get a much higher figure because those maps\nwill show zigs and zags in the coastline that are polished to straight lines\non the wall map. But if I went all the way around the coast with a tape\nmeasure, I\u2019d pick up even smaller variations and get an even larger number. If\nI did it with calipers, the number would be larger still. This process can be\nrepeated more or less indefinitely, and so it is impossible to answer the\noriginal question straightforwardly. The length of the coastline of Great\nBritain must be defined in terms of fractal geometry.\n\nA cross-section of the seafloor has the same property. The route between the\nlanding station at Songkhla, Thailand, and the one at Lan Tao Island, Hong\nKong, might have a certain length when measured on a map, say 2,500\nkilometers. But if you attach a 2,500-kilometer cable to Songkhla and, wearing\na diving suit, begin manually unrolling it across the seafloor, you will run\nout of cable before you reach the public beach at Tong Fuk. The reason is that\nthe cable follows the bumpy topography of the seafloor, which ends up being a\nlonger distance than it would be if the seafloor were mirror-flat.\n\nOver long (intercontinental) distances, the difference averages out to about 1\npercent, so you might need a 2,525-kilometer cable to go from Songkhla to Lan\nTao. The extra 1 percent is slack, in the sense that if you grabbed the ends\nand pulled the cable infinitely tight (bar tight, as they say in the\nbusiness), it would theoretically straighten out and you would have an extra\n25 kilometers. This slack is ideally molded into the contour of the seafloor\nas tightly as a shadow, running straight and true along the surveyed course.\nAs little slack as possible is employed, partly because cable costs a lot of\nmoney (for the FLAG cable, $16,000 to $28,000 per kilometer, depending on the\namount of armoring) and partly because loose coils are just asking for trouble\nfrom trawlers and other hazards. In fact, there is so little slack (in the\nlayperson\u2019s sense of the word) in a well-laid cable that it cannot be grappled\nand hauled to the surface without snapping it.\n\nThis raises two questions, one simple and one nauseatingly difficult and\ncomplex. First, how does one repair a cable if it\u2019s too tight to haul up?\n\nThe answer is that it must first be pulled slightly off the seafloor by a\ndetrenching grapnel, which is a device, meant to be towed behind a ship, that\nrolls across the bottom of the ocean on two fat tractor tires. Centered\nbetween those tires is a stout, wicked-looking, C-shaped hook, curving forward\nat the bottom like a stinger. It carves its way through the muck and\neventually gets under the cable and lifts it up and holds it steady just above\nthe seafloor. At this point its tow rope is released and buoyed off.\n\nThe ship now deploys another towed device called a cutter, which, seen from\nabove, is shaped like a manta ray. On the top and bottom surfaces it carries\nV-shaped blades. As the ship makes another pass over the detrenching grapnel,\none of these blades catches the cable and severs it.\n\nIt is now possible to get hold of the cut ends, using other grapnels. A cable\nrepair ship carries many different kinds of grapnels and other hardware, and\nkeeping track of them and their names (like \u201clong prong Sam\u201d) is sort of like\ntaking a course in exotic marine zoology. One of the ends is hauled up on\nboard ship, and a new length of cable is spliced onto it solely to provide\nexcess slack. Only now can both ends of the cable be brought aboard the ship\nat the same time and the final splice made.\n\nBut now the cable has way too much slack. It can\u2019t just be dumped overboard,\nbecause it would form an untidy heap on the bottom, easily snagged. Worse, its\nprecise location would not be known, which is suicide from a legal point of\nview. As long as a cable\u2019s position is precisely known and marked on charts,\navoiding it is the responsibility of every mariner who comes that way. If it\u2019s\nout of place, any snags are the responsibility of the cable\u2019s owners.\n\nSo the loose loop of cable must be carefully lowered to the bottom on the end\nof a rope and arranged into a sideways bight that lies alongside the original\nroute of the cable something like an oxbow lake beside a river channel. The\ngeometry of this bight is carefully recorded with sidescan sonar so that the\ninformation can be forwarded to the people who update the world\u2019s nautical\ncharts.\n\nOne problem: now you have a rope between your ship\u2019s winch and the recently\nlaid cable. It looks like an old-fashioned, hairy, organic jute rope, but it\nhas a core of steel. It is a badass rope, extremely strong and heavy and\nexpensive. You could cut it off and drop it, but this would waste money and\nleave a wild rope trailing across the seafloor, inviting more snags.\n\nSo at this point you deploy your submersible remotely operated vehicle (ROV)\non the end of an umbilical. It rolls across the seabed on its tank tracks,\nfinds the rope, and cuts it with its terrifying hydraulic guillotine.\n\nSad to say, that was the answer to the easy question. The hard one goes like\nthis: You are the master of a cable ship just off Songkhla, and you have taken\non 2,525 kilometers of cable which you are about to lay along the\n2500-kilometer route between there and Tong Fuk Beach on Lan Tao Island. You\nhave the 1 percent of slack required. But 1 percent is just an average figure\nfor the whole route. In some places the seafloor is rugged and may need 5\npercent slack; in others it is perfectly flat and the cable may be laid\nstraight as a rod. Here\u2019s the question: How do you ensure that the extra 25\nkilometers ends up where it\u2019s supposed to?\n\nRemember that you are on a ship moving up and down on the waves and that you\nwill be stretching the cable out across a distance of several kilometers\nbetween the ship and the contact point on the ocean floor, sometimes through\nundersea currents. If you get it wrong, you\u2019ll get suspensions in the cable,\nwhich will eventually develop into faults, or you\u2019ll get loops, which will be\nsnagged by trawlers. Worse yet, you might actually snap the cable. All of\nthese, and many more entertaining things, happened during the colorful early\nyears of the cable business.\n\nThe answer has to do with slack control. And most of what is known about slack\ncontrol is known by Cable & Wireless Marine. AT&T presumably knows about slack\ncontrol too, but Cable & Wireless Marine has twice as many ships and dominates\nthe deep-sea cable-laying industry. The Japanese can lay cable in shallow\nwater and can repair it anywhere. But the reality is that when you want to\nslam a few thousand kilometers of state-of-the-art optical fiber across a\nmajor ocean, you call Cable & Wireless Marine, based in England. That is\npretty much what FLAG did several years ago.\n\nIn which the Hacker Tourist treks to Land\u2019s end, the haunt of Druids, Pirates,\nand Telegraphers.\n\nAn idyllic hike to the tiny Cornish town of Porthcurno. More flagon hoisting\nat the Cable Station. Lord Kelvin\u2019s handiwork examined and explained. Early\nbits. The surveyors of the oceans in Chelmsford, and how computers play an\nessential part in their work. Alexander Graham Bell, the second Supreme Ninja\nHacker Mage Lord, and his misguided analog detour. Legacy of Kelvin, Bell, and\nFLAG to the wired world.\n\n50\u00b0 3.965\u2032 N, 5\u00b0 42.745 WLand\u2019s End, Cornwall, England\n\nAs anyone can see from a map of England, Cornwall is a good jumping-off place\nfor cables across the Atlantic, whether they are laid westward to the Americas\nor southward to Spain or the Azores. A cable from this corner of the island\nneeds to traverse neither the English Channel nor the Irish Sea, both of which\nare shallow and fraught with shipping. Cornwall also possesses the other\nnecessary prerequisite of a cable landing site in that it is an ancient haunt\nof pirates and smugglers and is littered with ceremonial ruins left behind by\nshadowy occult figures. The cable station here is called Porthcurno.\n\nNot knowing exactly where Porthcurno is (it is variously marked on maps, if\nmarked at all), the hacker tourist can find it by starting at Land\u2019s End,\nwhich is unambiguously located (go to England; walk west until the land ends).\nHe can then walk counterclockwise around the coastline. The old fractal\nquestion of \u201cHow long is the coastline of Great Britain\u201d thus becomes more\nthan a purely abstract exercise. The answer is that in Cornwall it is much\nlonger than it looks, because the fractal dimension of the place is high \u2013\nCornwall is bumpy. All of the English people I talked to before getting here\ntold me that the place was rugged and wild and beautiful, but I snidely\nassumed that they meant \u201cby the standards of England.\u201d As it turns out,\nCornwall is rugged and wild and beautiful even by the standards of, say,\nNorthern California. In America we assume that any place where humans have\nlived for more than a generation has been pretty thoroughly screwed up, so it\nis startling to come to a place where 2,000-year-old ruins are all over the\nplace and find that it is still virtually a wilderness.\n\nFrom Land\u2019s End you can reach Porthcurno in two or three hours, depending on\nhow much time you spend gawking at views, clambering up and down cliffs,\nexploring caves, and taking dips at small perfect beaches that can be found\nwedged into clefts in the rock.\n\nCables almost never land in industrial zones, first because such areas are\nheavily traveled and frequently dredged, second because of pure geography.\nIndustry likes rivers, which bring currents, which are bad for cables. Cities\nlike flat land. But flat land above the tide line implies a correspondingly\ngentle slope below the water, meaning that the cable will pass for a greater\ndistance through the treacherous shallows. Three to thirty meters is the range\nof depth where most of the ocean dynamics are and where cable must be armored.\nBut in wild places like Porthcurno or Lan Tao Island, rivers are few and\nsmall, and the land bursts almost vertically from the sea. The same geography,\nof course, favors pirates and smugglers.\n\nThe company that laid the first part of it was called the Falmouth, Gibraltar\nand Malta Telegraph Company, which is odd because the cable never went to\nFalmouth \u2013 a major port some 50 kilometers from Porthcurno. Enough anchors had\nhooked cables, even by that point, that \u201cmajor port\u201d and \u201csubmarine cable\nstation\u201d were seen to be incompatible, so the landing site was moved to\nPorthcurno.That was just the beginning: the company (later called the Eastern\nCable Company, after all the segments between Porthcurno and Darwin merged)\nwas every bit as conscious of the importance of redundancy as today\u2019s Internet\narchitects \u2013 probably more so, given the unreliability of early cables. They\nran another cable from Porthcurno to the Azores and then to Ascension Island,\nwhere it forked: one side headed to South America while the other went to Cape\nTown and then across the Indian Ocean. Subsequent transatlantic cables\nterminated at Porthcurno as well.\n\nMany of the features that made Cornwall attractive to cable operators also\nmade it a suitable place to conduct transatlantic radio experiments, and so in\n1900 Guglielmo Marconi himself established a laboratory on Lizard Point, which\nis directly across the bay from Porthcurno, some 30 kilometers distant.\nMarconi had another station on the Isle of Wight, a few hundred kilometers to\nthe east, and when he succeeded in sending messages between the two, he\nconstructed a more powerful transmitter at the Lizard station and began trying\nto send messages to a receiver in Newfoundland. The competitive threat to the\ncable industry could hardly have been more obvious, and so the Eastern\nTelegraph Company raised a 60-meter mast above its Porthcurno site, hoisted an\nantenna, and began eavesdropping on Marconi\u2019s transmissions. A couple of\ndecades later, after the Italian had worked the bugs out of the system, the\ngovernment stepped in and arranged a merger between his company and the\nsubmarine cable companies to create a new, fully integrated communications\nmonopoly called Cable & Wireless.\n\n50\u00b0 2.602\u2032 N5\u00b0 39.054\u2032 WMuseum of Submarine Telegraphy, Porthcurno, Cornwall\n\nOn a sunny summer day, Porthcurno Beach was crowded with holiday makers. The\nvast majority of these were scantily clad and tended to face toward the sun\nand the sea. The fully clothed and heavily shod tourists with their backs to\nthe water were the hacker tourists; they were headed for a tiny, windowless\ncement blockhouse, scarcely big enough to serve as a one-car garage, planted\nat the apex of the beach. There was a sign on the wall identifying it as the\nMuseum of Submarine Telegraphy and stating that it is open only on Wednesday\nand Friday.\n\nThis was appalling news. We arrived on a Monday morning, and our maniacal\nschedule would not brook a two-day wait. Stunned, heartbroken, we walked\naround the thing a couple of times, which occupied about 30 seconds. The\nlifeguard watched us uneasily. We admired the brand-new manhole cover set into\nthe ground in front of the hut, stamped with the year \u201996, which strongly\nsuggested a connection with FLAG. We wandered up the valley for a couple of\nhundred meters until it opened up into a parking lot for beach-goers,\nsurrounded by older white masonry buildings. These were well-maintained but\ndid not seem to be used for much. We peered at a couple of these and\nspeculated (wrongly, as it turned out) that they were the landing station for\nFLAG.\n\nTantalizing hints were everywhere: the inevitable plethora of manholes,\nnetworked to one another by long straight strips of new pavement set into the\nparking lot and the road. Nearby, a small junkheap containing several lengths\nof what to the casual visitor might look like old, dirty pipe but which on\ncloser examination proved to be hunks of discarded coaxial cable. But all the\nbuildings were locked and empty, and no one was around.\n\nOur journey seemed to have culminated in failure. We then noticed that one of\nthe white buildings had a sign on the door identifying it as The Cable Station\n\u2013 Free House. The sign was adorned with a painting of a Victorian shore\nlanding in progress \u2013 a line of small boats supporting a heavy cable being\npayed out from a sailing ship anchored in Porthcurno Bay.\n\nAfter coming all this way, it seemed criminal not to have a drink in this pub.\nBy hacker tourist standards, a manhole cover counts as a major attraction, and\nso it was almost surreal to have stumbled across a place that had seemingly\nbeen conceived and built specifically for us. Indeed, we were the only\ncustomers in the place. We admired the photographs and paintings on the walls,\nwhich all had something or other to do with cables. We made friends with Sally\nthe Dog, chatted with the proprietress, grabbed a pint, and went out into the\nbeer garden to drown our sorrows.\n\nSomewhat later, we unburdened ourselves to the proprietress, who looked a bit\nstartled to learn of our strange mission, and said, \u201cOh, the fellows who run\nthe museum are inside just now.\u201d\n\nFaster than a bit speeding down an optical fiber we were back inside the pub\nwhere we discovered half a dozen distinguished gentlemen sitting around a\ntable, finishing up their lunches. One of them, a tall, handsome, craggy sort,\napologized for having ink on his fingers. We made some feeble effort to\nexplain the concept of Wired magazine (never easy), and they jumped up from\ntheir seats, pulled key chains out of their pockets, and took us across the\nparking lot, through the gate, and into the museum proper. We made friends\nwith Minnie the Cable Dog and got the tour. Our primary guides were Ron\nWerngren (the gent with ink on his fingers, which I will explain in a minute)\nand John Worrall, who is the cheerful, energetic, talkative sort who seems to\nbe an obligatory feature of any cable-related site.\n\nAll of these men are retired Cable & Wireless employees. They sketched in for\nus the history of this strange compound of white buildings. Like any old-time\ncable station, it housed the equipment for receiving and transmitting messages\nas well as lodgings and support services for the telegraphers who manned it.\nBut in addition it served as the campus of a school where Cable & Wireless\nforeign service staff were trained, complete with dormitories, faculty\nhousing, gymnasium, and dining hall.\n\nThe whole campus has been shut down since 1970. In recent years, though, the\ngentlemen we met in the pub, with the assistance of a local historical trust,\nhave been building and operating the Museum of Submarine Telegraphy here.\nThese men are of a generation that trained on the campus shortly after World\nWar II, and between them they have lived and worked in just as many exotic\nplaces as the latter-day cable guys we met on Lan Tao Island: Buenos Aires,\nAscension Island, Cyprus, Jordan, the West Indies, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,\nTrinidad, Dubai.\n\nFortunately, the tiny hut above the beach is not the museum. It\u2019s just the\nplace where the cables are terminated. FLAG and other modern cables bypass it\nand terminate in a modern station up at the head of the valley, so all of the\ncables in this hut are old and out of service. They are labeled with the names\nof the cities where they terminate: Faial in the Azores, Brest in France,\nBilbao in Spain, Gibraltar 1, Saint John\u2019s in Newfoundland, the Isles of\nScilly, two cables to Carcavelos in Portugal, Vigo in Spain, Gibraltar 2 and\n3. From this hut, the wires proceed up the valley a couple hundred meters to\nthe cable station proper, which is encased in solid rock.\n\nDuring World War II, the Porthcurno cable nexus was such a painfully obvious\ntarget for a Nazi attack that a detachment of Cornish miners were brought in\nto carve a big tunnel out of a rock hill that rises above the campus. This\nturned out to be so wet that it was necessary to then construct a house inside\nthe tunnel, complete with pitched roof, gutters, and downspouts to carry away\nthe eternal drizzle of groundwater. The strategically important parts of the\ncable station were moved inside. Porthcurno Bay and the Cable & Wireless\ncampus were laced with additional defensive measures, like a fuel-filled pipe\nunderneath the water to cremate incoming Huns.\n\nNow the house in the tunnel is the home of the museum. It is sealed from the\noutside world by two blast doors, each of which consists of a foot-thick box\nwelded together from inch-thick steel plate. The inner door has a gasket to\nkeep out poison gas. Inside, the building is clean and almost cozy, and except\nfor the lack of windows, one is not conscious of being underground.\n\nPractically the first thing we saw upon entering was a fully functional Kelvin\nmirror galvanometer \u2013 the exquisitely sensitive detector that sent Wildman\nWhitehouse into ignominy, made the first transatlantic cable useful, and\nearned William Thomson his first major fortune. Most of its delicate innards\nare concealed within a metal case. The beam of light that reflects off its\ntiny twisting mirror shines against a long horizontal screen of paper, marked\nand numbered like a yardstick, extending about 10 inches on either side of a\ncentral zero point. The light forms a spot on this screen about the size and\nshape of a dime cut in half. It is so sensitive that merely touching the\nmachine\u2019s case \u2013 grounding it \u2013 causes the spot of light to swing wildly to\none end of the scale.\n\nAt Porthcurno this device was used for more than one purpose. One of the most\nimportant activities at a cable station is pinpointing the locations of\nfaults, which is done by measuring the resistance in the cable. Since the\nresistance per unit of length is a known quantity, a precise measurement of\nresistance gives the distance to the fault. Measuring resistance was done by\nuse of a device called a Wheatstone bridge. The museum has a beautiful one,\nbuilt in a walnut box with big brass knobs for dialing in resistances. Use of\nthe Wheatstone bridge relies on achieving a null current with the highest\nattainable level of precision, and for this purpose, no instrument on earth\nwas better suited than the Kelvin mirror galvanometer. Locating a mid-ocean\nfault in a cable therefore was reduced to a problem of twiddling the dials on\nthe Wheatstone bridge until the galvanometer\u2019s spot of light was centered on\nthe zero mark.\n\nThe reason for the ink on Ron Werngren\u2019s fingers became evident when we moved\nto another room and beheld a genuine Kelvin siphon recorder, which he was in\nthe process of debugging. This machine represented the first step in the\nremoval of humans from the global communications loop that has culminated in\nthe machine room at cable landing stations like Ninomiya.\n\nAfter Kelvin\u2019s mirror galvanometer became standard equipment throughout the\nwired world, every message coming down the cables had to pass, briefly,\nthrough the minds of human operators such as the ones who were schooled at the\nPorthcurno campus. These were highly trained young men in slicked hair and\nstarched collars, working in teams of two or three: one to watch the moving\nspot of light and divine the letters, a second to write them down, and, if the\nmessage were being relayed down another cable, a third to key it in again.\n\nIt was clear from the very beginning that this was an error-prone process, and\nwhen the young men in the starched collars began getting into fistfights, it\nalso became clear that it was a job full of stress. The stress derived from\nthe fact that if the man watching the spot of light let his attention wander\nfor one moment, information would be forever lost. What was needed was some\nmechanical way to make a record of the signals coming down the cable. But\nbecause of the weakness of these signals, this was no easy job.\n\nLord Kelvin, never one to rest on his laurels, solved the problem with the\nsiphon recorder. For all its historical importance, and for all the money it\nmade Kelvin, it is a flaky-looking piece of business. There is a reel of paper\ntape which is drawn steadily through the machine by a motor. Mounted above it\nis a small reservoir containing perhaps a tablespoon of ink. What looks like a\ngossamer strand emerges from the ink and bends around through some delicate\nmetal fittings so that its other end caresses the surface of the moving tape.\nThis strand is actually an extremely thin glass tube that siphons the ink from\nthe reservoir onto the paper. The idea is that the current in the cable, by\npassing through an electromechanical device, will cause this tube to move\nslightly to one side or the other, just like the spot of light in the mirror\ngalvanometer. But the current in the old cables was so feeble that even the\ninfinitesimal contact point between the glass tube and the tape still induced\ntoo much friction, so Kelvin invented a remarkable kludge: he built a vibrator\ninto the system that causes the glass tube to thrum like a guitar string so\nthat its point of contact on the paper is always in slight motion.\n\nDynamic friction (between moving objects) is always less than static friction\n(between objects that are at rest with respect to each other). The vibration\nin the glass siphon tube reduced the friction against the paper tape to the\npoint where even the weak currents in a submarine cable could move it back and\nforth. Movement to one side of the tape represented a dot, to the other side a\ndash. We prevailed upon Werngren to tap out the message Get Wired.The result\nis on the cover of this magazine, and if you know Morse code you can pick the\nletters out easily.\n\nThe question naturally arises: How does one go about manufacturing a hollow\nglass tube thinner than a hair? More to the point, how did they do it 100\nyears ago? After all, as Worrall pointed out, they needed to be able to repair\nthese machines when they were posted out on Ascension Island. The answer is\nstraightforward and technically sweet: you take a much thicker glass tube,\nheat it over a Bunsen burner until it glows and softens, and then pull sharply\non both ends. It forms a long, thin tendril, like a string of melted cheese\nstretching away from a piece of pizza. Amazingly, it does not close up into a\nsolid glass fiber, but remains a tube no matter how thin it gets.\n\nExactly the same trick is used to create the glass fibers that run down the\ncenter of FLAG and other modern submarine cables: an ingot of very pure glass\nis heated until it glows, and then it is stretched. The only difference is\nthat these are solid fibers rather than tubes, and, of course, it\u2019s all done\nusing machines that assure a consistent result.\n\nMoving down the room, we saw a couple of large tabletops devoted to a\ncomplete, functioning reproduction of a submarine cable system as it might\nhave looked in the 1930s. The only difference is that the thousands of miles\nof intervening cable are replaced with short jumper wires so that transmitter,\nrepeaters, and receiver are contained within a single room.\n\nAll the equipment is built the way they don\u2019t build things anymore: polished\nwooden cabinets with glass tops protecting gleaming brass machinery that\nwhirrs and rattles and spins. Relays clack and things jiggle up and down. At\none end of the table is an autotransmitter that reads characters off a paper\ntape, translates them into Morse code or cable code, and sends its output, in\nthe form of a stream of electrical pulses, to a regenerator/retransmitter\nunit. In this case the unit is only a few feet away, but in practice it would\nhave been on the other end of a long submarine cable, say in the Azores. This\nregenerator/retransmitter unit sends its output to a twin siphon-tube recorder\nwhich draws both the incoming signal (say, from London) and the outgoing\nsignal as regenerated by this machine on the same paper tape at the same time.\nThe two lines should be identical. If the machine is not functioning\ncorrectly, it will be obvious from a glance at the tape.\n\nThe regenerated signal goes down the table (or down another submarine cable)\nto a machine that records the message as a pattern of holes punched in tape.\nIt also goes to a direct printer that hammers out the words of the message in\ncapital letters on another moving strip of paper. The final step is a gummer\nthat spreads stickum on the back of the tape so that it may be stuck onto a\ntelegraph form. (They tried to use pregummed tape, but in the tropics it only\ncoated the machinery with glue.)\n\nEach piece of equipment on this tabletop is built around a motor that turns\nover at the same precise frequency. None of it would work \u2013 no device could\ncommunicate with any other device \u2013 unless all of those motors were spinning\nin lockstep with one another. The transmitter, regenerator/retransmitter, and\nprinter all had to be in sync even though they were thousands of miles apart.\n\nThis feat is achieved by means of a collection of extremely precise analog\nmachinery. The heart of the system is another polished box that contains a\nvibrating reed, electromagnetically driven, thrumming along at 30 cycles per\nsecond, generating the clock pulses that keep all the other machines turning\nover at the right pace. The reed is as precise as such a thing can be, but\nover time it is bound to drift and get out of sync with the other vibrating\nreeds in the other stations.\n\nIn order to control this tendency, a pair of identical pendulum clocks hang\nnext to each other on the wall above. These clocks feed steady, one-second\ntiming pulses into the box housing the reed. The reed, in turn, is driving a\nmotor that is geared so that it should turn over at one revolution per second,\ngenerating a pulse with each revolution. If the frequency of the reed\u2019s\nvibration begins to drift, the motor\u2019s speed will drift along with it, and the\npulse will come a bit too early or a bit too late. But these pulses are being\ncompared with the steady one-second pulses generated by the double pendulum\nclock, and any difference between them is detected by a feedback system that\ncan slightly speed up or slow down the vibration of the reed in order to\ncorrect the error. The result is a clock so steady that once one of them is\nset up in, say, London, and another is set up in, say, Cape Town, the\nmachinery in those two cities will remain synched with each other\nindefinitely.\n\nThis is precisely the same function that is performed by the quartz clock chip\nat the heart of any modern computing device. The job performed by the\nregenerator/retransmitter is also perfectly recognizable to any modern\ndigitally minded hacker tourist: it is an analog-to-digital converter. The\nanalog voltages come down the cable into the device, the circuitry in the box\ndecides whether the signal is a dot or a dash (or if you prefer, a 1 or a 0),\nand then an electromagnet physically moves one way or the other, depending on\nwhether it\u2019s a dot or a dash. At that moment, the device is strictly digital.\nThe electromagnet, by moving, then closes a switch that generates a new pulse\nof analog voltage that moves on down the cable. The hacker tourist, who has\nspent much of his life messing around with invisible, ineffable bits, can\nhardly fail to be fascinated when staring into the guts of a machine built in\n1927, steadily hammering out bits through an electromechanical process that\ncan be seen and even touched.\n\nAs I started to realize, and as John Worrall and many other cable-industry\nprofessionals subsequently told me, there have been new technologies but no\nnew ideas since the turn of the century. Alas for Internet chauvinists who\nsneer at older, \u201canalog\u201d technology, this rule applies to the transmission of\ndigital bits down wires, across long distances. We\u2019ve been doing it ever since\nMorse sent \u201cWhat hath God wrought!\u201d from Washington to Baltimore.\n\n(Latitude & longitude unknown)Cable & Wireless MarineChelmsford, England\n\n[Note: I left my GPS receiver on a train in Bristol and had to do without it\nfor a couple of weeks until Mr. Gallagher, station supervisor at Preston,\nLancashire, miraculously found it and sent it back to me. Chelmsford is a\nhalf-hour train ride northeast of London.]\n\nWhen last we saw our hypothetical cable-ship captain, sitting off of Songkhla\nwith 2,525 kilometers of very expensive cable, we had put him in a difficult\nspot by asking the question of how he could ensure that his 25 kilometers of\nslack ended up in exactly the right place. Essentially the same question was\nraised a few years ago when FLAG approached Cable & Wireless Marine and said,\nin effect: \u201cWe are going to buy 28,000 kilometers of fancy cable from AT&T and\nKDD, and we would like to have it go from England to Spain to Italy to Egypt\nto Dubai to India to Thailand to Hong Kong to China to Korea to Japan. We\nwould like to pay for as little slack as possible, because the cable is\nexpensive. What little slack we do buy needs to go in exactly the right place,\nplease. What should we do next?\u201d\n\nSo it was that Captain Stuart Evans\u2019s telephone rang. At the time (September\n1992), he was working for a company called Worldwide Ocean Surveying, but by\nthe time we met him, that company had been bought out by Cable & Wireless\nMarine, of which he is now general manager \u2013 survey. Evans is a thoroughly\npleasant middle-aged fellow, a former merchant marine captain, who seemed just\na bit taken aback that anyone would care about the minute details of what he\nand his staff do for a living. A large part of being a hacker tourist is\nconvincing people that you are really interested in the nitty-gritty and not\njust looking for a quick, painless sound bite or two; once this is\naccomplished, they always warm to the task, and Captain Evans was no\nexception.Evans\u2019s mission was to help FLAG select the most economical and\nsecure route. The initial stages of the process are straightforward: choose\nthe landing sites and then search existing data concerning the routes joining\nthose sites. This is referred to as a desk search, with mild but unmistakable\ncondescension. Evans and his staff came up with a proposed route, did the desk\nsearch, and sent it to FLAG for approval. When FLAG signed off on this, it was\ntime to go out and perform the real survey. This process ran from January to\nSeptember 1994.\n\nEach country uses the same landing sites over and over again for each new\ncable, so you might think that the routes from, say, Porthcurno to Spain would\nbe well known by now. In fact, every new cable passes over some virgin\nterritory, so a survey is always necessary. Furthermore, the territory does\nnot remain static. There are always new wrecks, mobile sand waves, changes in\nanchorage patterns, and other late-breaking news.\n\nTo lay a cable competently you must have a detailed survey of a corridor\nsurrounding the intended route. In shallow water, you have relatively precise\ncontrol over where the cable ends up, but the bottom can be very irregular,\nand the cable is likely to be buried into the seabed. So you want a narrow (1\nkilometer wide) corridor with high resolution. In deeper water, you have less\nlateral control over the descending cable, but at the same time the phenomena\nyou\u2019re looking at are bigger, so you want a survey corridor whose width is 2\nto 3 times the ocean depth but with a coarser resolution. A resolution of 0.5\npercent of the depth might be considered a minimum standard, though the FLAG\nsurvey has it down to 0.25 percent in most places. So, for example, in water\n5,000 meters deep, which would be a somewhat typical value away from the\ncontinental shelf, the survey corridor would be 10 to 15 kilometers in width,\nand a good vertical resolution would be 12 meters.\n\nThe survey process is almost entirely digital. The data is collected by a\nsurvey ship carrying a sonar rig that fires 81 beams spreading down and out\nfrom the hull in a fan pattern. At a depth of 5,000 meters, the result,\napproximately speaking, is to divide the 10-kilometer-wide corridor into grid\nsquares 120 meters wide and 175 meters long and get the depth of each one to a\nprecision of some 12 meters.\n\nThe raw data goes to an onboard SPARCstation that performs data assessment in\nreal time as a sort of quality assurance check, then streams the numbers onto\nDAT cassettes. The survey team is keeping an eye on the results, watching for\nany formations through which cable cannot be run. These are found more\nfrequently in the Indian than in the Atlantic Ocean, mostly because the\nAtlantic has been charted more thoroughly.\n\nSteep slopes are out. A cable that traverses a steep slope will always want to\nslide down it sideways, secretly rendering every nautical chart in the world\nobsolete while imposing unknown stresses on the cable. This and other\nconstraints may throw an impassable barrier across the proposed route of the\ncable. When this happens, the survey ship has to backtrack, move sideways, and\nsurvey other corridors parallel and adjacent to the first one, gradually\nbuilding a map of a broader area, until a way around the obstruction is found.\nThe proposed route is redrafted, and the survey ship proceeds.\n\nThe result is a shitload of DAT tapes and a good deal of other data as well.\nFor example, in water less than 1,200 meters deep, they also use sidescan\nsonar to generate analog pictures of the bottom \u2013 these look something like\nblack-and-white photographs taken with a point light source, with the\nexception that shadows are white instead of black. It is possible to scan the\nsame area from several different directions and then digitally combine the\nimages to make something that looks just like a photo. This may provide\ncrucial information that would never show up on the survey \u2013 for example, a\ndense pattern of anchor scars indicates that this is not a good place to lay a\ncable. The survey ship can also drop a flowmeter that will provide information\nabout currents in the ocean.\n\nThe result of all this, in the case of the FLAG survey, was about a billion\ndata points for the bathymetric survey alone, plus a mass of sidescan sonar\nplots and other documentation. The tapes and the plots filled a room about 5\nmeters square all the way to the ceiling. The quantity of data involved was so\nvast that to manage it on paper, while it might have been theoretically\npossible given unlimited resources, was practically impossible given that FLAG\nis run by mortals and actually has to make money. FLAG is truly an undertaking\nof the digital age in that it simply couldn\u2019t have been accomplished without\nthe use of computers to manage the data.Evans\u2019s mission was to present FLAG\nwith a final survey report. If he had done it the old-fashioned way, the\nreport would have occupied some 52 linear feet of shelf space, plus several\nhefty cabinets full of charts, and the inefficiency of dealing with so much\npaper would have made it nearly impossible for FLAG\u2019s decision makers }to\ngrasp everything.\n\nInstead, Evans bought FLAG a PC and a plotter. During the summer of 1994,\nwhile the survey data was still being gathered, he had some developers write\nbrowsing software. Keeping in mind that FLAG\u2019s investors were mostly high-\nfinance types with little technical or nautical background, they gave the\nbrowser a familiar, easy-to-use graphical user interface. The billion data\npoints and the sidescan sonar imagery were boiled down into a form that would\nfit onto 5 CD-ROMs, and in that form the final report was presented to FLAG at\nthe end of 1994. When FLAG\u2019s decision makers wanted to check out a particular\npart of the route, they could zoom in on it by clicking on a map, picking a\nsmall square of ocean, and blowing it up to reveal sev-eral different kinds of\nplots: a topographic map of the seafloor, information abstracted from the\nsidescan sonar images, a depth profile along the route, and another profile\nshowing the consistency of the bot-tom \u2013 whether muck, gravel, sand, or hard\nrock. All of these could be plotted out on meterwide sheets of paper that\nprovided a much higher-resolution view than is afforded by the computer\nscreen.\n\nThis represents a noteworthy virtuous circle \u2013 a self-amplifying trend. The\ndevelopment of graphical user interfaces has led to rapid growth in personal\ncomputer use over the last decade, and the coupling of that technology with\nthe Internet has caused explosive growth in the use of the World Wide Web,\ngenerating enormous demand for bandwidth. That (in combination, of course,\nwith other demands) creates a demand for submarine cables much longer and more\nambitious than ever before, which gets investors excited \u2013 but the resulting\nproject is so complex that the only way they can wrap their minds around it\nand make intelligent decisions is by using a computer with a graphical user\ninterface.\n\nHacking wires\n\nAs you may have figured out by this point, submarine cables are an incredible\npain in the ass to build, install, and operate. Hooking stuff up to the ends\nof them is easy by comparison. So it has always been the case that cables get\nlaid first and then people begin trying to think of new ways to use them. Once\na cable is in place, it tends to be treated not as a technological artifact\nbut almost as if it were some naturally occurring mineral formation that might\nbe exploited in any number of different ways.\n\nThis was true from the beginning. The telegraphy equipment of 1857 didn\u2019t work\nwhen it was hooked up to the first transatlantic cable. Kelvin had to invent\nthe mirror galvanometer, and later the siphon recorder, to make use of it.\nNeedless to say, there were many other Victorian hackers trying to patent\ninventions that would enable more money to be extracted from cables. One of\nthese was a Scottish-Canadian-American elocutionist named Alexander Graham\nBell, who worked out of a laboratory in Boston.\n\nBell was one of a few researchers pursuing a hack based on the phenomenon of\nresonance. If you open the lid of a grand piano, step on the sustain pedal,\nand sing a note into it, such as a middle C, the strings for the piano\u2019s C\nkeys will vibrate sympathetically, while the D strings will remain still. If\nyou sing a D, the D strings vibrate and the C strings don\u2019t. Each string\nresonates only at the frequency to which it has been tuned and is deaf to\nother frequencies.\n\nIf you were to hum out a Morse code pattern of dots and dashes, all at middle\nC, a deaf observer watching the strings would notice a corresponding pattern\nof vibrations. If, at the same time, a second person was standing next to you\nhumming an entirely different sequence of dots and dashes, but all on the\nmusical tone of D, then a second deaf observer, watching the D strings, would\nbe able to read that message, and so on for all the other tones on the scale.\nThere would be no interference between the messages; each would come through\nas clearly as if it were the only message being sent. But anyone who wasn\u2019t\ndeaf would hear a cacophony of noise as all the message senders sang in\ndifferent rhythms, on different notes. If you took this to an extreme, built a\nspecial piano with strings tuned as close to each other as possible, and\ntrained the message senders to hum Morse code as fast as possible, the sound\nwould merge into an insane roar of white noise.\n\nElectrical oscillations in a wire follow the same rules as acoustical ones in\nthe air, so a wire can carry exactly the same kind of cacophony, with the same\nresults. Instead of using piano strings, Bell and others were using a set of\nmetal reeds like the ones in a harmonica, each tuned to vibrate at a different\nfrequency. They electrified the reeds in such a way that they generated not\nonly acoustical vibrations but corresponding electrical ones. They sought to\ncombine the electrical vibrations of all these reeds into one complicated\nwaveform and feed it into one end of a cable. At the far end of the cable,\nthey would feed the signal into an identical set of reeds. Each reed would\nvibrate in sympathy only with its counterpart on the other end of the wire,\nand by recording the pattern of vibrations exhibited by that reed, one could\nextract a Morse code message independent of the other messages being\ntransmitted on the other reeds. For the price of one wire, you could send many\nsimultaneous coded messages and have them all sort themselves out on the other\nend.\n\nTo make a long story short, it didn\u2019t work. But it did raise an interesting\nquestion. If you could take vibrations at one frequency and combine them with\nvibrations at another frequency, and another, and another, to make a\ncomplicated waveform, and if that waveform could be transmitted to the other\nend of a submarine cable intact, then there was no reason in principle why the\ncomplex waveform known as the human voice couldn\u2019t be transmitted in the same\nway. The only difference would be that the waves in this case were merely\nliteral representations of sound waves, rather than Morse code sequences\ntransmitted at different frequencies. It was, in other words, an analog hack\non a digital technology.\n\nWe have all been raised to think of the telephone as a vast improvement on the\ntelegraph, as the steamship was to the sailing ship or the electric lightbulb\nto the candle, but from a hacker tourist\u2019s point of view, it begins to seem\nlike a lamentable wrong turn. Until Bell, all telegraphy was digital. The\nmultiplexing system he worked on was purely digital in concept even if it did\nmake use of some analog properties of matter (as indeed all digital equipment\ndoes). But when his multiplexing scheme went sour, he suddenly went analog on\nus.\n\nFortunately, the story has a happy ending, though it took a century to come\nabout. Because analog telephony did not require expertise in Morse code,\nanyone could take advantage of it. It became enormously popular and generated\nstaggering quantities of revenue that underwrote the creation of a\nfantastically immense communications web reaching into every nook and cranny\nof every developed country.\n\nThen modems came along and turned the tables. Modems are a digital hack on an\nanalog technology, of course; they take the digits from your computer and\nconvert them into a complicated analog waveform that can be transmitted down\nexisting wires. The roar of white noise that you hear when you listen in on a\nmodem transmission is exactly what Bell was originally aiming for with his\nreeds. Modems, and everything that has ensued from them, like the World Wide\nWeb, are just the latest example of a pattern that was established by Kelvin\n140 years ago, namely, hacking existing wires by inventing new stuff to put on\nthe ends of them.\n\nIt is natural, then, to ask what effect FLAG is going to have on the latest\nand greatest cable hack: the Internet. Or perhaps it\u2019s better to ask whether\nthe Internet affected FLAG. The explosion of the Web happened after FLAG was\nplanned. Taketo Furuhata, president and CEO of IDC, which runs the Miura\nstation, says: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether Nynex management foresaw the burst of\ndemand related to the Internet a few years ago \u2013 I don\u2019t think so. Nobody \u2013\nnot even AT&T people \u2013 foresaw this. But the demand for Internet transmission\nis so huge that FLAG will certainly become a very important pipe to transmit\nsuch requirements.\u201d\n\nJohn Mercogliano, vice president \u2013 Europe, Nynex Network Systems (Bermuda)\nLtd., says that during the early 1990s when FLAG was getting organized, Nynex\nexecutives felt in their guts that something big was going to happen involving\nbroadband multimedia transmission over cables. They had a media lab that was\ngiving demos of medical imaging and other such applications. \u201cWe knew the\nInternet was coming \u2013 we just didn\u2019t know it was going to be called the\nInternet,\u201d he says.\n\nFLAG may, in fact, be the last big cable system that was planned in the days\nwhen people didn\u2019t know about the Internet. Those days were a lot calmer in\nthe global telecom industry. Everything was controlled by monopolies, and\ncable construction was based on sober, scientific forecasts, analogous, in\nsome ways, to the actuarial tables on which insurance companies predicate\ntheir policies.\n\nWhen you talk on the phone, your words are converted into bits that are sent\ndown a wire. When you surf the Web, your computer sends out bits that ask for\nyet more bits to be sent back. When you go to the store and buy a Japanese VCR\nor an article of clothing with a Made in Thailand label, you\u2019re touching off a\ncascade of information flows that eventually leads to transpacific faxes,\nphone calls, and money transfers.\n\nIf you get a fast busy signal when you dial your phone, or if your Web browser\nstalls, or if the electronics store is always low on inventory because the\ndistribution system is balled up somewhere, then it means that someone,\nsomewhere, is suffering pain. Eventually this pain gets taken out on a fairly\nsmall number of meek, mild-mannered statisticians \u2013 telecom traffic\nforecasters \u2013 who are supposed to see these problems coming.\n\nLike many other telephony-related technologies, traffic forecasting was\ndeveloped to a fine art a long time ago and rarely screwed up. Usually the\ntelcos knew when the capacity of their systems was going to be stretched past\nacceptable limits. Then they went shopping for bandwidth. Cables got built.\n\nThat is all past history. \u201cThe telecoms aren\u2019t forecasting now,\u201d Mercogliano\nsays. \u201cThey\u2019re reacting.\u201d\n\nThis is a big problem for a few different reasons. One is that cables take a\nfew years to build, and, once built, last for a quarter of a century. It\u2019s not\na nimble industry in that way. A PTT thinking about investing in a club cable\nis making a 25-year commitment to a piece of equipment that will almost\ncertainly be obsolete long before it reaches the end of its working life. Not\nonly are they risking lots of money, but they are putting it into an\nexceptionally long-term investment. Long-term investments are great if you\nhave reliable long-term forecasts, but when your entire forecasting system\ngets blown out of the water by something like the Internet, the situation gets\nawfully complicated.\n\nThe Internet poses another problem for telcos by being asymmetrical. Imagine\nyou are running an international telecom company in Japan. Everything you\u2019ve\never done, since TPC-1 came into Ninomiya in \u201964, has been predicated on\ncircuits. Circuits are the basic unit you buy and sell \u2013 they are to you what\ncars are to a Cadillac dealership. A circuit, by definition, is symmetrical.\nIt consists of an equal amount of bandwidth in each direction \u2013 since most\nphone conversations, on average, entail both parties talking about the same\namount. A circuit between Japan and the United States is something that\nenables data to be sent from Japan to the US, and from the US to Japan, at the\nsame rate \u2013 the same bandwidth. In order to get your hands on a circuit, you\ncut a deal with a company in the States. This deal is called a correspondent\nagreement.\n\nOne day, you see an ad in a magazine for a newfangled thing called a modem.\nYou hook one end up to a computer and the other end to a phone line, and it\nenables the computer to grab a circuit and exchange data with some other\ncomputer with a modem. So far, so good. As a cable-savvy type, you know that\npeople have been hacking cables in this fashion since Kelvin. As long as the\nthing works on the basis of circuits, you don\u2019t care \u2013 any more than a car\nsalesman would care if someone bought Cadillacs, tore out the seats, and used\nthem to haul gravel.\n\nA few years later, you hear about some modem-related nonsense called the World\nWide Web. And a year after that, everyone seems to be talking about it. About\nthe same time, all of your traffic forecasts go down the toilet. Nothing\u2019s\nworking the way it used to. Everything is screwed up.\n\nWhy? Because the Web is asymmetrical. All of your Japanese Web customers are\nusing it to access sites in the States, because that\u2019s where all the sites are\nlocated. When one of them clicks on a button on an American Web page, a\nrequest is sent over the cable to the US. The request is infinitesimal, just a\nfew bytes. The site in the States promptly responds by trying to send back a\nhigh-resolution, 24-bit color image of Cindy Crawford, or an MPEG film of a\nspace shuttle mission. Millions of bytes. Your pipe gets jammed solid with\nincoming packets.\n\nYou\u2019re a businessperson. You want to make your customers happy. You want them\nto get their millions of bytes from the States in some reasonable amount of\ntime. The only way to make this happen is to purchase more circuits on the\ncables linking Japan to the States. But if you do this, only half of each\ncircuit is going to be used \u2013 the incoming half. The outgoing half will carry\na miserable trickle of packets. Its bandwidth will be wasted. The\ncorrespondent agreement relationship, which has been the basis of the\ninternational telecom business ever since the first cables were laid, doesn\u2019t\nwork anymore.\n\nThis, in combination with the havoc increasingly being wrought by callback\nservices, is weird, bad, hairy news for the telecom monopolies. Mercogliano\nbelieves that the solution lies in some sort of bandwidth arbitrage scheme,\nbut talking about that to an old-time telecrat is like describing derivative\ninvestments to an old codger who keeps his money under his mattress. \u201cThe club\nsystem is breaking down,\u201d Mercogliano says.\n\nSomewhere between50\u00b0 54.20062\u2032 N, 1\u00b0 26.87229 W and50\u00b0 54.20675\u2032 N, 1\u00b0\n26.95470 WCable Ship Monarch, Southampton, England\n\nJohn Mercogliano, if this is conceivable, logs even more frequent-flier miles,\nto even more parts of the planet, than the cable layers we met on Lan Tao\nIsland. He lives in London, his office is in Amsterdam, his territory is\nEurope, he works for a company headquartered in Bermuda that has many ties to\nthe New York metropolitan area and that does business everywhere from\nPorthcurno to Miura. He is trim, young-looking, and vigorous, but even so the\nschedule occasionally takes its toll on him, and he feels the need to just get\naway from his job for a few days and think about something \u2013 anything \u2013 other\nthan submarine cables. The last time this feeling came over him, he made\ninquiries with a tourist bureau in Ireland that referred him to a quiet, out-\nof-the-way place on the coast: a stately home that had been converted to a\nseaside inn, an ideal place for him to go to get his mind off his work.\nMercogliano flew to Ireland and made his way overland to the place, checked\ninto his room, and began ambling through the building. The first thing he saw\nwas a display case containing samples of various types of 19th-century\nsubmarine cables. It turned out that the former owner of this mansion had been\nthe captain of the Great Eastern, the first of the great deep-sea cable-laying\nships.\n\nThe Great Eastern got that job because it was by a long chalk the largest ship\non the planet at the time \u2013 so large that its utter uselessness had made it a\nlaughingstock, the Spruce Goose of its day. The second generation of long-\nrange submarine cables, designed to Lord Kelvin\u2019s specifications after the\ndebacle of 1857, were thick and heavy. Splicing segments together in mid-ocean\nhad turned out to be problematical, so there were good reasons for wanting to\nmake the cable in one huge piece and simply laying the whole thing in one go.\n\nIt is easier to splice cables now and getting easier all the time. Coaxial\ncables of the last few decades took some 36 to 48 hours to splice, partly\nbecause it was necessary to mold a jacket around them. Modern cables can be\nspliced in more like 12 hours, depending on the number of fibers they contain.\nSo modern cable ships needn\u2019t be quite as great as the Great Eastern.\n\nOther than the tank that contains the cable, which is literally nothing more\nthan a big round hole in the middle of the ship, a cable ship is different\nfrom other ships in two ways. One, it comes with a complement of bow and stern\nthrusters coupled to exquisitely sensitive navigation gear on the bridge,\nwhich give it unsurpassed precision-maneuvering and station-keeping powers. In\nthe case of Monarch, a smaller cable repair ship that we visited in\nSouthampton, England, there are at least two differential GPS receivers, one\nfor the bow and one for the stern \u2013 hence the two readings given at the head\nof this section. Each one of them reads out to five decimal places, which\nimplies a resolution of about 1 centimeter.\n\nSecond, a cable ship has two winches on board. But this does not do justice to\nthem, as they are so enormous, so powerful, and yet so nimble that it would\nalmost be more accurate to say that a cable ship is two floating winches.\nNearly everything that a cable ship does reduces, eventually, to winching.\nLaying a cable is a matter of paying cable out of a winch, and repairing it,\nas already described, involves a much more complicated series of winch-related\nactivities.\n\nAs Kelvin figured out the hard way, whenever you are reeling in a long line,\nyou must first relieve all tension on it or else your reel will be crushed.\nThe same problem is posed in reverse by the cable-laying process, where\nthousands of meters of cable, weighing many tons, may be stretched tight\nbetween the ship and the contact point on the seafloor, but the rest of the\ncable stored on board the ship must be coiled loosely in the tanks with no\ntension on them at all. In both cases, the cable must be perfectly slack on\nthe ship end and very tight on the watery end of the winching machinery. Not\nsurprisingly, then, the same machinery is used for both outgoing and incoming\nwinch work.\n\nAt one end of the ship is a huge iron drum some 3 meters in diameter with a\nfew turns of cable around it. As you can verify by wrapping a few turns of\nrope around a pipe and tugging, this is a very simple way to relieve tension\non a line. It is not, however, very precise, and here, precise control is very\nimportant. That is provided by something called a linear engine, which\nconsists of several pairs of tires mounted with a narrow gap between them (for\nyou baseball fans, it is much like a pitching machine). The cable is threaded\nthrough this gap so that it is gripped on both sides by the tires. Monarch\u2018s\nlinear engine contains 16 pairs of tires which, taken together, can provide up\nto 10 tons of holdback force. Augmented by the drums, which can be driven by\npower from the ship\u2019s main engines, the ultimate capacity of Monarch\u2018s cable\nengines is 30 tons.\n\nThe art of laying a submarine cable is the art of using all the special\nfeatures of such a ship: the linear engines, the maneuvering thrusters, and\nthe differential GPS equipment, to put the cable exactly where it is supposed\nto go. Though the survey team has examined a corridor many thousands of meters\nwide, the target corridor for the cable lay is 200 meters wide, and the\nmasters of these ships take pride in not straying more than 10 meters from the\ncharted route. This must be accomplished through the judicious manipulation of\nonly a few variables: the ship\u2019s position and speed (which are controlled by\nthe engines, thrusters, and rudder) andthe cable\u2019s tension and rate of payout\n(which are controlled by the cable engine).\n\nOne cannot merely pay the cable out at the same speed as the ship moves\nforward. If the bottom is sloping down and away from the ship as the ship\nproceeds, it is necessary to pay the cable out faster. If the bottom is\nsloping up toward the ship, the cable must come out more slowly . Such\ncalculations are greatly complicated by the fact that the cable is stretched\nout far behind the ship \u2013 the distance between the ship and the cable\u2019s\ncontact point on the bottom of the ocean can be more than 30 kilometers, and\nthe maximum depth at which (for example) KDD cable can be laid is 8,000\nmeters. Insofar as the shape of the bottom affects what the ship ought to be\ndoing, it\u2019s not the shape of the bottom directly below the ship that is\nrelevant, but the shape of the bottom wherever the contact point happens to be\nlocated, which is by no means a straightforward calculation. Of course, the\nship is heaving up and down on the ocean and probably being shoved around by\nwind and currents while all this is happening, and there is also the\npossibility of ocean currents that may move the cable to and fro during its\ndescent.\n\nIt is not, in other words, a seat-of-the-pants kind of deal; the skipper can\u2019t\njust sit up on the bridge, eyeballing a chart, and twiddling a few controls\naccording to his intuition. In practice, the only way to ensure that the cable\nends up where it is supposed to is to calculate the whole thing ahead of time.\nJust as aeronautical engineers create numerical simulations of hypothetical\nairplanes to test their coefficient of drag, so do the slack control wizards\nof Cable & Wireless Marine use numerical simulation techniques to model the\ncatenary curve adopted by the cable as it stretches between ship and contact\npoint. In combination with their detailed data on the shape of the ocean\nfloor, this enables them to figure out, in advance, exactly what the ship\nshould do when. All of it is boiled down into a set of instructions that is\nturned over to the master of the cable ship: at such and such a point,\nincrease speed to x knots and reduce cable tension to y tons and change payout\nspeed to z meters per second, and so on and so forth, all the way from\nPorthcurno to Miura.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like it would make a good videogame,\u201d I said to Captain Stuart Evans\nafter he had laid all of this out for me. I was envisioning something called\nSimCable. \u201cIt would make a good videogame,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut it also makes a\ngreat job, because it\u2019s a combination of art and science and technique \u2013 and\nit\u2019s not an art you learn overnight. It\u2019s definitely a black art.\u201d\n\nCable & Wireless\u2019s Marine Survey department has nailed the slack control\nproblem. That, in combination with the company\u2019s fleet of cable-laying ships\nand its human capital, makes it dominant in the submarine cable-laying world.\n\nBy \u201chuman capital\u201d I mean their ability to dispatch weather-beaten operatives\nsuch as the Lan Tao Island crowd to difficult places like Suez and have them\nknow their asses from their elbows. As we discovered on our little jaunt to\nEgypt, where we tried to rendezvous with a cable ship in the Gulf of Suez and\nwere turned back by the Egyptian military, one doesn\u2019t just waltz into places\nlike that on short notice and get stuff to happen.\n\nIn each country between England and Japan, there are hoops that must be jumped\nthrough, cultural differences that must be understood, palms that must be\ngreased, unwritten rules that must be respected. The only way to learn that\nstuff is to devote a career to it. Cable & Wireless has an institutional\nmemory stretching all the way back to 1870, when it laid the first cable from\nPorthcurno to Australia, and the British maritime industry as a whole\npossesses a vast fund of practical experience that is the legacy of the\nEmpire.\n\nOne can argue that, in the end, the British Empire did Britain surprisingly\nlittle good. Other European countries that had pathetic or nonexistent\nempires, such as Italy, have recently surpassed England in standard of living\nand other measures of economic well-being. Scholars of economic history have\nworked up numbers suggesting that Britain spent more on maintaining its empire\nthan it gained from exploiting it. Whether or not this is the case, it is\nquite obvious from looking at the cable-laying industry that the Victorian\npractice of sending British people all over the planet is now paying them back\nhandsomely.\n\nThe current position of AT&T versus Cable & Wireless reflects the shape of\nAmerica versus the shape of the British Empire. America is a big, contiguous\nmass, easy to defend, immensely wealthy, and basically insular. No one comes\nclose to it in developing new technologies, and AT&T has always been one of\nAmerica\u2019s technological leaders. By contrast, the British Empire was spread\nout all over the place, and though it controlled a few big areas (such as\nIndia and Australia), it was basically an archipelago of outposts, let us say\na network, completely dependent on shipping and communications to stay alive.\nIts dominance was always more economic than military \u2013 even at the height of\nthe Victorian era, its army was smaller than the Prussian police force. It\ncould coerce the natives, but only so far \u2013 in the end, it had to co-opt them,\ngive them some incentive to play along. Even though the Empire has been\ndissolving itself for half a century, British people and British institutions\nstill know how to get things done everywhere.\n\nIt is not difficult to work out how all of this has informed the development\nof the submarine cable industry. AT&T makes really, really good cables; it has\nthe pure technology nailed, though if it doesn\u2019t stay on its toes, it\u2019ll be\nflattened by the Japanese. Cable & Wireless doesn\u2019t even try to make cables,\nbut it installs them better than anyone else.\n\nThe legacy\n\nKelvin founded the cable industry by understanding the science, and developing\nthe technology, that made it work. His legacy is the ongoing domination of the\ncable-laying industry by the British, and his monument is concealed beneath\nthe waves: the ever growing web of submarine cables joining continents\ntogether.\n\nBell founded the telephone industry. His legacy was the Bell System, and his\nmonument was strung up on poles for all to see: the network of telephone wires\nthat eventually found its way into virtually every building in the developed\nworld. Bell founded New England Telephone Company, which eventually was\nabsorbed into the Bell System. It never completely lost its identity, though,\nand it never forgot its connection to Alexander Graham Bell \u2013 it even moved\nBell\u2019s laboratory into its corporate headquarters in Boston.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Bell System in the early 1980s, New England Telephone\nand its sibling Baby Bell, New York Telephone, joined together to form a new\ncompany called Nynex, whose loyal soldiers are eager to make it clear that\nthey see themselves as the true heirs of Bell\u2019s legacy. Now, Nynex and Cable &\nWireless, the brainchildren of Bell and Kelvin, the two supreme ninja hacker\nmage lords of global telecommunications, have formed an alliance to challenge\nAT&T and all the other old monopolies.\n\nWe know how the first two acts of the story are going to go: In late 1997,\nwith the completion of FLAG, Luke (\u201cNynex\u201d) Skywalker, backed up on his\nOedipal quest by the heavy shipping iron of Han (\u201cCable & Wireless\u201d) Solo,\nwill drop a bomb down the Death Star\u2019s ventilation shaft. In 1999, with the\ncompletion of SEA-ME-WE 3, the Empire will Strike Back. There is talk of a\nFLAG 2, which might represent some kind of a Return of the Jedi scenario.\n\nBut once the first FLAG has been built, everyone\u2019s going to get into the act \u2013\nit\u2019s going to lead to a general rebellion. \u201cFLAG will change the way things\nare done. They are setting a benchmark,\u201d says Dave Handley, the cable layer.\nAnd Mercogliano makes a persuasive case that national telecom monopolies will\nbe so preoccupied, over the next decade, with building the \u201clast mile\u201d and\ngetting their acts together in a competitive environment that they\u2019ll have no\nchoice but to leave cable laying to the entrepreneurs.\n\nThat\u2019s the simple view of what FLAG represents. It is important to remember,\nthough, that companies like Cable & Wireless and Nynex are not really heroic\nantimonopolists. A victory for FLAG doesn\u2019t lead to a pat ending like in Star\nWars \u2013 it does not get us into an idealized free market. \u201cOne thing to bear in\nmind is that Cable & Wireless is a club and they are rigorously\nanticompetitive wherever they have the opportunity,\u201d said Doug Barnes, the\ncypherpunk. \u201cNynex and the other Baby Bells are self-righteously trying to\ncrack open other companies\u2019 monopolies while simultaneously trying to hold\nonto their domestic ones. The FLAG folks are merely clubs with a smidgin more\nvision, enough business sense to properly reward talent, and a profound desire\nto make a great pile of money.\u201d\n\nThere has been a lot of fuss in the last few years concerning the 50th\nanniversary of the invention of the computer. Debates have raged over who\ninvented the computer: Atanasoff or Mauchly or Turing? The only thing that has\nbeen demonstrated is that, depending on how you define computer, any one of\nthe above, and several others besides, can be said to have invented it.\n\nOddly enough, this debate comes at a time when stand-alone computers are\nseeming less and less significant and the Internet more so. Whether or not you\nagree that \u201cthe network is the computer,\u201d a phrase Scott McNealy of Sun\nMicrosystems recently coined, you can\u2019t dispute that moving information around\nseems to have much broader appeal than processing it. Many more people are\ninterested in email and the Web than were interested in databases and\nspreadsheets.\n\nYet little attention has been paid to the historical antecedents of the\nInternet \u2013 perhaps partly because these cable technologies are much older and\nless accessible and partly because many Net people want so badly to believe\nthat the Net is fundamentally new and unique. Analog is seen as old and bad,\nand so many people assume that the communications systems of old were strictly\nanalog and have just now been upgraded to digital.\n\nThis overlooks much history and totally misconstrues the technology. The first\ncables carried telegraphy, which is as purely digital as anything that goes on\ninside your computer. The cables were designed that way because the hackers of\na century and a half ago understood perfectly well why digital was better. A\nsingle bit of code passing down a wire from Porthcurno to the Azores was apt\nto be in sorry shape by the time it arrived, but precisely because it was a\nbit, it could easily be abstracted from the noise, then recognized,\nregenerated, and transmitted anew.\n\nThe world has actually been wired together by digital communications systems\nfor a century and a half. Nothing that has happened during that time compares\nin its impact to the first exchange of messages between Queen Victoria and\nPresident Buchanan in 1858. That was so impressive that a mob of celebrants\npoured into the streets of New York and set fire to City Hall.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to observe that, so far, no one has gotten sufficiently excited\nover a hot new Web page to go out and burn down a major building. But this is\na little too glib. True, that mob in the streets of New York in 1858 was\ncelebrating the ability to send messages quickly across the Atlantic. But, if\nthe network is the computer, then in retrospect, those torch-bearing New\nYorkers could be seen as celebrating the joining of the small and primitive\ncomputer that was the North American telegraph system to the small and\nprimitive computer that was the European system, to form The Computer, with a\ncapital C.\n\nAt that time, the most important components of these Computers \u2013 the CPUs, as\nit were \u2013 were tense young men in starched collars. Whenever one of them\nstepped out to relieve himself, The Computer went down. As good as they were\nat their jobs, they could process bits only so fast, so The Computer was very\nslow. But The Computer has done nothing since then but get faster, become more\nautomated, and expand. By 1870, it stretched all the way to Australia. The\nadvent of analog telephony plunged The Computer into a long dormant phase\nduring which it grew immensely but lost many of its computerlike\ncharacteristics.\n\nBut now The Computer is fully digital once again, fully automatic, and faster\nthan hell. Most of it is in the United States, because the United States is\nlarge, free, and made of dirt. Largeness eliminates troublesome borders.\nFreeness means that anyone is allowed to patch new circuits onto The Computer.\nDirt makes it possible for anyone with a backhoe to get in on the game. The\nComputer is striving mightily to grow beyond the borders of the United States,\ninto a world that promises even vaster economies of scale \u2013 but most of that\nworld isn\u2019t made of dirt, and most of it isn\u2019t free. The lack of freedom stems\nboth from bad laws, which are grudgingly giving way to deregulation, and from\nmonopolies willing to do all manner of unsavory things in order to protect\ntheir turf.\n\nEven though FLAG\u2019s bandwidth isn\u2019t that great by 1996 Internet standards, and\neven though some of the companies involved in it are, in other arenas, guilty\nof monopolistic behavior, FLAG really is going to help blow open bandwidth and\nweaken the telecom monopolies.\n\nIn many ways it hearkens back to the wild early days of the cable business.\nThe first transatlantic cables, after all, were constructed by private\ninvestors who, like FLAG\u2019s investors, just went out and built cable because it\nseemed like a good idea. After FLAG, building new high-bandwidth, third-\ngeneration fiber-optic cable is going to seem like a good idea to a lot of\nother investors. And unlike the ones who built FLAG, they will have the\nbenefit of knowing about the Internet, and perhaps of understanding, at some\nlevel, that they are not merely stringing fancy telephone lines but laying\ndown new traces on the circuit board of The Computer. That understanding may\nlead them to create vast amounts of bandwidth that would blow the minds of the\nentrenched telecrats and to adopt business models designed around packet-\nswitching instead of the circuits that the telecrats are stuck on.\n\nIf the network is The Computer, then its motherboard is the crust of Planet\nEarth. This may be the single biggest drag on the growth of The Computer,\nbecause Mother Earth was not designed to be a motherboard. There is too much\nwater and not enough dirt. Water favors a few companies that know how to lay\ncable and have the ships to do it. Those companies are about to make a whole\nlot of money.\n\nEventually, though, new ships will be built. The art of slack control will\nbecome common knowledge \u2013 after all, it comes down to a numerical simulation\nproblem, which should not be a big chore for the ever-expanding Computer. The\nfloors of the oceans will be surveyed and sidescanned down to every last sand\nripple and anchor scar. The physical challenges, in other words, will only get\neasier.\n\nThe one challenge that will then stand in the way of The Computer will be the\ncultural barriers that have always hindered cooperation between different\npeoples.
