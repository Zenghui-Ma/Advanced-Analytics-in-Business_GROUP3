And it addresses concerns from some\nmembers of the Senate by extending the deadline for TikTok to find a buyer.\n\nPresident Biden supports the effort. That means TikTok being forced to sell,\nor face a possible ban, is on the fast-track to becoming law.\n\nIt would mark the first time ever the U.S. government has passed a law that\ncould shut down an entire social media platform, setting the stage for what is\nexpected to be a protracted legal battle.\n\nTikTok condemned the bill as an unconstitutional attack against the hugely\npopular service.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of\nimportant foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban\nbill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans,\" said\nTikTok spokesman Alex Haurek.\n\n### Fears over propaganda, spying, fuel TikTok crackdown\n\nNational security officials in Washington have feared that the Chinese\ngovernment could use TikTok to promote propaganda aimed at interfering in U.S.\nelections, or surveil some of the 170 million Americans who use the app every\nmonth.\n\nThose concerns remain largely hypothetical.\n\nTikTok is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, yet there is no publicly\navailable evidence that government officials have ever influenced what\nAmericans see on the app, nor any proof that officials in China have spied on\nU.S. citizens through TikTok.\n\nTikTok says it has built a firewall between its headquarters in Los Angeles\nand its parent company in Beijing, but some reports indicate U.S. user data\ndoes still move between the two.\n\nWhile there has been no evidence made public that Chinese government officials\nhave accessed Americans' information through TikTok, the idea that China has\nthe theoretical ability to weaponize an app used by half of America has been\nenough to set off an all-out crackdown.\n\n### Questions about exactly what a buyer would be getting\n\nUnder the bill just passed by the House, TikTok would be given up to a year to\nfind a company, or group of investors, to acquire it. That extends the\ntimeline from the six-month window the app was given in the original bill the\nHouse passed last month, which some Senators said was too short.\n\nRelated Story: Federal judge blocks Montana's TikTok ban before it takes\neffect\n\nBut that has raised a critical question among TikTok experts: What exactly\nwould they be buying?\n\nTikTok's algorithm, the secret sauce of the app, is owned by ByteDance. And\nduring the Trump administration's campaign against TikTok, China added\ncontent-recommendation algorithms to its export-control list, meaning selling\nthe technology would require the blessing of the Chinese government.\n\nJames Lewis, director of the technology and public-policy program at the\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies, said that is a non-starter for\nBeijing.\n\nRelated Story: New DOJ Filing: TikTok's Owner Is 'A Mouthpiece' Of Chinese\nCommunist Party\n\n\"The Chinese said very firmly this month at senior levels that they won't let\nthe algorithm be sold and without it, it's an empty deal,\" Lewis told NPR.\n\nThen there is the hurdle of the pricetag itself.\n\nGiven that TikTok is one of the largest and most popular social media\nplatforms in the world, its value would put it out of reach for all but the\nlargest tech companies.\n\nIt's not known exactly how much TikTok is worth, but analysts peg its\nprivately-owned parent company, ByteDance, at around $225 billion. TikTok is\nby far the company's most successful service.\n\nIf a Silicon Valley giant attempted to take over TikTok, that would almost\ncertainly attract scrutiny from antitrust enforcers in Washington, who have\ngrown increasingly skeptical of deals that increase the reach of already-\nmassive tech firms.\n\nLewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is doubtful the\nlatest push will result in ByteDance letting go of TikTok. But, he noted, it\ndoes forestall the issue until after the November presidential election:\n\n\"The bill buys time to figure out a real solution, while putting space between\npassage and the election.\"\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": true}
