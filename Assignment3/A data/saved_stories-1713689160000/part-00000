Points\n\n  * In Los Angeles, the Homelessness Prevention Program uses predictive AI to identify individuals and families at risk of becoming homeless, offering aid to help them get stabilized and remain housed.\n  * Launched in 2021, the program has helped serve nearly 800 individuals and families at risk of becoming homeless, with 86 percent of participants retaining permanent housing when they leave, according to Dana Vanderford, associate director at the county\u2019s Department of Health Services.\n  * Individuals and families have access to between $4,000 and $8,000, she said.\n\nA

BROWN | AFP | Getty Images\n\nIn December of last year, single mom Courtney Peterson was laid off from her\njob working for a now-shuttered inpatient transitional living program. Aside\nfrom giving her the ability to bring her 7-year-old son to work, the job also\npaid enough to cover rent in a studio apartment in the Van Nuys neighborhood\nin Los Angeles, where they had lived for a year and a half.\n\nAfter she was laid off, Peterson said she grew immediately concerned about\nmaking January\u2019s rent and began researching potential avenues for help. When\nher son was an infant, they lived in a travel trailer, she said, a situation\nshe did not want to return to.\n\n\u201cI started to reach out to local churches or places that said they offered\nrent assistance,\u201d Peterson told CNBC. \u201cBut a lot of them wanted me to have\nactive eviction notices in order to give me assistance. I felt like I was\nrunning out of options. I\u2019d reached out to pretty much everyone I could\npossibly think of with no luck.\u201d\n\nInstead of an eviction notice, Peterson received a letter from the\nHomelessness Prevention Unit within the Los Angeles County Department of\nHealth Services, offering a lifeline. The pilot program uses predictive\nartificial intelligence to identify individuals and families at risk of\nbecoming homeless, offering aid to help them get stabilized and remain housed.\n\nIn 2023, California had more than 181,000 homeless individuals, up more than\n30 percent since 2007, according to data from the Department of Housing and\nUrban Development. A report from the California State Auditor\u2019s Office found\nthat the state spent $24 billion on homelessness from 2018 through 2023.\n\nLaunched in 2021, the program has helped the department serve nearly 800\nindividuals and families at risk of becoming homeless, with 86 percent of\nparticipants retaining permanent housing when they leave, according to Dana\nVanderford, associate director of homelessness prevention at the county\u2019s\nDepartment of Health Services.\n\nIndividuals and families have access to between $4,000 and $8,000, she said,\nwith the majority of the funding for the program coming from the American\nRescue Plan Act. Tracking individuals down to help and convincing them that\nthe offer is real and not a scam can be a challenge, but once contact is\nestablished, aid is quickly put into motion.\n\n\u201cWe often meet our clients within days of a loss of housing, or days after\nthey\u2019ve had a medical emergency. The timing with which we meet people feels\ncritical,\u201d Vanderford said. \u201cOur ability to appear out of nowhere, cold-call a\nperson, provide them with resources and prevent that imminent loss of housing\nfor 86 percent of the people that we\u2019ve worked with feels remarkable.\u201d\n\nPeterson said she and her son received some $8,000 to cover rent, utilities\nand basic needs, allowing her to stay put in her apartment while she looks for\na new job. The program works with clients for four months and then follows up\nwith them at the six-month mark and the 12-month mark, as well as 18 months\nafter discharge. Caseworkers like Amber Lung, who helped Peterson, say they\ncan see how important preventive work is firsthand.\n\n\u201cOnce folks do lose that housing, it feels like there\u2019s so many more hurdles\nto get back to [being] housed, and so if we can fill in just a little bit of a\ngap there might be to help them retain that housing, I think it\u2019s much easier\nto stabilize things than if folks end up in a shelter or on the streets to get\nthem back into that position,\u201d Lung said.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO3:0203:02\n\nUsing AI to prevent homelessness: Here\u2019s what to know\n\nSquawk Box\n\n## Predicting risk\n\nThe AI model was developed by the California Policy Lab at UCLA over the\ncourse of several years, using data provided by Los Angeles County\u2019s Chief\nInformation Office, or CIO. The CIO integrated data from seven different\ncounty departments, de-identified for privacy, including emergency room\nvisits, behavioral health care and large public benefits programs from food\nstamps to income support and homeless services, according to Janey Rountree,\nexecutive director of the California Policy Lab. The program also pulled data\nfrom the criminal justice system.\n\nThat data, linked together over many years, are what would be used to make\npredictions about who would go on to experience homelessness.\n\nOnce the model identified patterns in who experienced homelessness, the lab\nused it to attempt to make predictions about the future, creating an\nanonymized list of individuals ranked from highest risk to lowest. The lab\nprovided the list to the county so it could reach out to people who may be at\nrisk of losing housing before it happened.\n\nHowever, past research has found that anonymized data can be traced back to\nindividuals based on demographic information. A sweeping study on data\nprivacy, based on 1990 U.S. Census data, found that 87% of Americans could be\nidentified using ZIP code, birth date and gender.\n\n\u201cWe have a deep, multi-decade long housing shortage in California, and the\ncost of housing is going up, increasingly, and that is the cause of our people\nexperiencing homelessness,\u201d Rountree said. \u201cThe biggest misperception is that\nhomelessness is caused by individual risk factors, when in fact it\u2019s very\nclear that the root cause of this is a structural economic issue.\u201d\n\nThe Policy Lab provided the software to the county for free, Rountree said,\nand does not plan to monetize it. Using AI in close partnership with people\nwho have relevant subject-matter expertise \u2014 from teachers to social workers \u2014\ncan help to promote positive social outcomes, she said.\n\n\u201cI just want to emphasize how important it is for every community experiencing\nhomelessness, to test and innovate around prevention,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nrelatively new strategy in the lifespan of homeless services. We need more\nevidence. We need to do more experiments around how to find people at risk. I\nthink this is just one way to do that.\u201d\n\nThe National Alliance to End Homelessness found in 2017 that a chronically\nhomeless person costs the taxpayer an average of $35,578 per year, and those\ncosts are reduced by an average of nearly half when they are placed in\nsupportive housing.\n\nLos Angeles County has had initial conversations with Santa Clara County about\nthe program, and San Diego County is also exploring a similar approach,\nVanderford said.\n\n## Government use of artificial intelligence\n\nAI in the hands of government agencies has faced scrutiny due to potential\noutcomes. Police reliance on AI technology has led to wrongful arrests, and,\nin California, voters rejected a plan to repeal the state\u2019s bail system in\n2020 and replace it with an algorithm to determine individual risk, over\nconcerns it would increase bias in the justice system.\n\nBroadly speaking, Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at AI startup\nHugging Face, said ethics around the government use of AI hinge on the context\nof use and safety of identifiable information, even if anonymized. Mitchell\nalso pointed to the importance of receiving informed consent from people\nseeking help from government programs.\n\n\u201cAre the people aware of all the signals that are being collected and the risk\nof it being associated to them and then the dual use concerns for malicious\nuse against them?\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the issue of how long this\ndata is being kept and who might eventually see it.\u201d\n\nWhile the technology aims to provide aid to those in need before their housing\nis lost in Los Angeles County, which Mitchell said is a positive thing to do\nfrom a \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d perspective, there are broader questions from a\nutilitarian viewpoint.\n\n\u201cThose would be concerns like, \u2018What is the cost to the taxpayer and how\nlikely is this system to actually avoid houselessness?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Peterson, she\u2019s in the process of looking for work, hoping for a remote\nposition that will allow her flexibility. Down the road, she\u2019s hoping to\nobtain her licensed vocational nursing certification and one day buy a home\nwhere her son has his own room.\n\n\u201cIt has meant a lot just because you know my son hasn\u2019t always had that\nstability. I haven\u2019t always had that stability,\u201d she said of the aid from the\nprogram. \u201cTo be able to call this place home and know that I\u2019m not going to\nhave to move out tomorrow, my son\u2019s not going to have to find new friends\nright away... It\u2019s meant a lot to both me and my son.\u201d\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Thursday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, eBay, Zoom, JetBlue, BJ\u2019s & more\n  * If you\u2019re worried about a correction and over-invested in Nvidia, replace it with these steady growth stocks instead\n  * It may be time for investors to sell Nvidia on the next bounce, according to the charts\n  * Wall Street is bullish on copper, thanks to AI.
