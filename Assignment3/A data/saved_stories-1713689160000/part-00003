It\u2019s why, he says, when he\nlistened to feedback from the firm\u2019s workforce, the same complaints surfaced\nrepeatedly.\n\n\u201cThey basically said: \u2018Increasingly, we can\u2019t get anything done,'\u201d Anderson\ntold Business Insider. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hard to get ideas approved, or you have\nto consult with so many people to make anything happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hire highly educated, trained people, and then we put them in these\nenvironments with rules and procedures and eight layers of hierarchy,\u201d\nAnderson added. \u201cThen we wonder why big companies are so lame most of the\ntime.\u201d\n\nSo, the company is going boss-less, or as he calls it, moving to \u201cdynamic\nshared ownership.\u201d\n\nWhether or not it\u2019s a fancy metaphor for a headcount reduction, Anderson has\ninsisted that this new way of working could be revolutionary. \u201cWe don\u2019t have\nto be that good to beat the current system,\u201d the 57-year-old chief executive\ntold the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn the coming years, Bayer\u2019s workforce will consist of constantly evolving\n\u201c5,000 to 6,000 self-directed teams\u201d that work together on projects of their\nchoosing for 90 days, before regrouping for their next project.\n\nEmployees of Bayer\u2019s consumer health division have already gotten a taste of\nthis new structure\u2014they\u2019re being shown how to practically sign off on one\nanother\u2019s ideas without a manager in sight.\n\n\u201cStand up, share an idea,\u201d a corporate trainer ordered them during a training\nsession, according to the WSJ. \u201cYou\u2019re going to self-organize.\u201d\n\n## Is going boss-less enough to fix \u2018broken\u2019 Bayer?\n\nWhether or not Anderson\u2019s plan lands, it will buy him time: The company is\nworth a quarter of its $122 billion peak from nine years ago, its shares have\ntanked by more than 50% in the last year, and investors are urging it to\nsplit.\n\nThe company has accumulated around \u20ac34.5 billion ($37.5 billion) in debt, not\nmuch less than the company\u2019s \u20ac47.6 billion ($51.7 billion) in sales last year.\n\nTo top that off, since its acquisition of Monsanto in 2018, Bayer has been\nfighting thousands of claims that its Roundup weed killer causes cancer.\n\nEven Anderson has compared the current state of the company to the time he\nfractured his leg skateboarding\u2014\u201cbadly broken.\u201d But looking ahead, he wrote in\nFortune that \u201cour radical reinvention will liberate our people\u201d while saving\nthe company about \u20ac2 billion ($2.15 billion) in annual organizational costs by\n2026.\n\n## But cutting out middle management is nothing new\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly how many managers will be laid off or demoted. Bayer\ncouldn\u2019t confirm the exact figure to Fortune but a spokesperson said there\nwill be \u201csignificant changes\u201d and those impacted will be in the thousands, not\nhundreds. The Journal reported that 40% of management positions are headed for\nthe chopping block in the U.S. pharmaceutical division alone.\n\nAlthough Anderson is pitching the move as an innovative way of transforming\nits corporate hierarchy and giving employees more choice, trimming middle\nmanagement to save costs and become more efficient is nothing new.\n\nIn fact, middle managers\u2014defined as nonexecutives who oversee employees\u2014made\nup almost a third of layoffs last year.\n\nAt Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 was going to be its \u201cYear of\nEfficiency,\u201d middle managers were the toll in that quest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you want a management structure that\u2019s just managers managing\nmanagers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are\ndoing the work,\u201d Zuckerberg told staff in an all-hands meeting.\n\nAfter laying off thousands of workers, the billionaire tech entrepreneur said\nthat \u201cflattening\u201d its internal hierarchy was core to its restructure\u2014and he\ncredited Elon Musk as the source of inspiration behind having \u201cfewer layers of\nmanagement.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile at Google\u2014where more than 30,000 managers are employed\u201412,000 people\nlost their jobs, and at Intel, managers\u2019 pay was slashed. Even beyond the tech\nindustry, layoffs at Citi and FedEx have massively impacted managers.\n\n## Latest in Leadership\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Tech - Productivity\n\n## ChatGPT-style AI bots have \u2018lit a fire in boardrooms\u2019 and it\u2019s all thanks\nto slick design, says AI unicorn \u2018chief wizard\u2019\n\nBYOrianna Rosa Royle\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n  * 5 days ago\n  * Leadership - Stellantis\n\n## Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares\u2019 almost 60% jump in pay to $39m slammed by\ninvestors 2 years after previous compensation plan rejected\n\nBYAlbertina Torsoli and Bloomberg\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\n  * 9 days ago\n  * Politics - Russia\n\n## Former Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny\u2019s \u2018final letter to the\nworld\u2019 to be published in posthumous memoir\n\nBYThe Associated Press\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n  * 10 days ago\n  * Leadership - layoffs\n\n## Pharmaceutical giant Bayer is getting rid of bosses and asking nearly\n100,000 workers to \u2018self-organize\u2019 to save $2.15 billion\n\nBYOrianna Rosa Royle\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n  * 15 days ago\n  * Success - work-life balance\n\n## 30-year-old banker quit $100,000 job to start a healthy fast food chain\nbecause he had no work-life balance\u2014but being his own boss was more work and\nhe even cut short his honeymoon\n\nBYOrianna Rosa Royle\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\n  * 16 days ago\n  * Success - retirement\n\n## Nearly a quarter of baby boomer and late Gen X men are \u2018unretiring\u2019 or\nplanning to because they can\u2019t afford to kick up their feet in the current\nclimate\n\nBYOrianna Rosa Royle\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Finance\n\n## Former HGTV star slapped with $10 million fine and jail time for real\nestate fraud\n\nBYSydney Lake\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Health\n\n## Your reusable water bottle may be a breeding ground for strep and fecal\nbacteria.
